    "summary": "1. Summary:\nThis case involves Erik Kertesz, the plaintiff, alleging that his former employer, Colony Tire Corporation, along with individuals Charles and Scott Creighton, engaged in conduct violating New Jersey law. Kertesz claims invasion of privacy for publicizing his medical conditions, and violations of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (NJLAD) for failing to accommodate his disability and potentially aiding and abetting discrimination. The court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment on several claims—indicating these claims, such as the invasion of privacy claim related to one specific email and potential NJLAD violations, require further examination at trial due to genuine issues of material fact.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe key legal issue is whether Defendants Colony Tire Corporation and the Creightons are liable for invading Kertesz’s privacy by disseminating his private medical information internally within the company and whether they failed to accommodate his health conditions in violation of the NJLAD.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court denied both Plaintiff's and Defendants' motions for summary judgment on most claims due to unresolved factual disputes. The court granted the Defendants' motion with respect to some privacy claims against Scott Creighton, as the communications in question did not meet the standard for public disclosure, while other claims will proceed to trial.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation:\nThink of it like this: Erik felt his boss, Charlie, shared too much about his health with his coworkers, which made Erik uncomfortable. Erik also believed his boss didn't treat him fairly when he was unwell, which might be against the rules. The judge couldn't decide who was right just from the paperwork; they need more information from both sides at a trial to understand what actually happened.",

Mot.”) and (2) Plaintiff  Erik \nKertesz’ s (“Kertesz” or “Plaintiff”) motion for summary judgment . (ECF 96, “Plaintiff’s Motion” \nor “Pl. Mot.”)  The parties  filed brief s in opposition to each respective m otion. (ECF 99, “Defs. \nOpp.”; ECF 100, “ Pl. Opp.” ) The parties also filed  reply brief s.  (ECF 103 , “Defs. Reply” ; ECF \n109, “Pl. Reply” .) The Court reviewed th e parties’  submissions and decided the motion without \noral argument pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 78 and Local Civil Rule 78.1. For the \nreasons stated below, Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is DENIED  and Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment is  GRANTED IN PART and  DENIED IN PART .   \n \n1 On July 16, 2025, Plaintiff moved to substitute Susan Creighton for Defendant Charles Creighton following Charles \nCreighton’s death on May 15, 2025. (ECF 112, “Motion to Substitute”.) On August 15, 2025, Magistrate Judge James \nB. Clark granted Plaintiff’s Motion to Substitute. (ECF 115.)  Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 1 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>2 I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY2 \nThe present lawsuit arises from Plaintiff’s  former  employment with Colony Tire. \nDefendant is a privately -owned company that provides tire care, auto repair , and maintenance \nservices, as well as wholesale tire distribution via its subsidiary Atlantic Tire Distributors \n(“Atlantic Tire”). (DSMF ¶ 1.) At the time the parties filed motions for summary judgment, \nDefendant Charl ie Creighton3 was CEO of Colony Tire , and Scott Creighton, his son, was \nPresident. ( Id.) Plaintiff began his employment at Colony Tire in August 2017 as the General \nManager of Atlantic Tire. ( Id. ¶ 9; PSMF ¶ 7.) During Plaintiff’s employment as General Manager \nof Atlantic Tire, Plaintiff was responsible for Atlantic Tire’s wholesale tire distribution operations, \nincluding its management, sales  staff, and the operations of warehouses. (DSMF  ¶ 10; PSMF ¶ 8.) \nPlaintiff’s responsibilities included visiting Colony Tire’s six warehouses. ( DSMF  ¶ 11; PSMF  ¶ \n9.)  \nPlaintiff signed an employment agreement on January 1, 2018, which formalized  his role \nas General Manager of Atlantic Tire. ( DSMF  ¶ 12.) The Employment Agreement implies, but does \nnot explicitly state, that Plaintiff was expected to move to North Carolina from New Jersey for his \nrole at Colony Tire. ( See ECF 95-3, Certification of Joseph DeBlasio, “DeBlasio Cert. ”; ECF 95 -\n5, De Blasio Cert. Ex. G.)4 On January 30, 2019, Plaintiff suffered a heart attack. (DSMF ¶ 16; \n \n2 The facts and procedural history are drawn from  Defendants ’ brief in support of their  motion for s ummary judgment \n(ECF 95-10, “Defs. Br.” ), Plaintiff ’s brief in support of his motion for summary judgment (ECF 96- 2, “Pl. Br.”), \nDefendants’ brief in opposition (ECF 99), Plaintiff ’s brief in opposition (ECF 100), Defendant s’ brief in r eply (ECF \n103), Plaintiff’s brief in reply (ECF 109 ) and the parties’ submissions of undisputed material facts (ECF 95 -9, \n“DSMF” ; ECF 97-17, “ PSMF”)  and responses to the submissions of undisputed material facts (ECF 99- 1 (Defendants’ \nResponse to PSMF); ECF 102 (Plaintiff’s Response to DSMF)) . The Court has also considered Defendants’  \nresponding statement of undisputed material facts (ECF 103- 1) and Plaintiff’s supplemental statement of undisputed \nmaterial facts responding to Defendants’ objections (ECF 105).  The Court does not credit statements in these filings \nthat contain legal argument or are unsupported by the record. See L. Civ. R. 56.1.  \n3 Defendant Charles Creighton died on May 15, 2025. ( See ECF 112.)  \n4 The Employment Agreement states: “Provided your house is listed for sale at the proper market price, Colony Tire/ \nAtlantic Tire will work with you in a very generous manner regarding your apartment / rental house in Edenton [North \nCarolina].” ( ECF 95 -5, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. G.)  Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 2 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>3 PSMF ¶ 10.) On that same day, Scott Creighton sent a text message to Plaintiff informing Plaintiff \nthat he would send an email “about you so everyone can pray for you but I’ll wait to hear from \nyou about who do you want people to call/email?” (DSMF  ¶ 16; ECF 95 -5, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. I.) \nPlaintiff responded: “Thanks it is ok if people call.” ( Id.) On February 28, 2019, Scott Creighton \ntexted Plaintiff again, stating,  “[a] lot of people asked last week how you were doing. Would you \nlike me or you to send out an update to all users on how you’re doing?” (DSMF ¶ 17 (citing \nDeBlasio Cert. Ex . J).) Plaintiff responded, “Okay, you can send something.” ( Id.) Colony Tire \npaid Plaintiff his full salary while he recovered from his heart attack . (DSMF ¶¶ 18-19.) Plaintiff \nmaintains that he worked as usual while recovering from his heart attack. (PSMF ¶ 11.)  \nIn July 2019, less than a year after his heart attack, Plaintiff was diagnosed with throat  \ncancer. (DSMF ¶ 20; PSMF ¶ 12.) Plaintiff informed Charlie and Scott Creighton of the diagnosis. \n(DSMF ¶ 20; PSMF  ¶ 12.) On July 9, 2019, Plaintiff emailed Scott and Charlie Creighton, “Just \nleaving the hospital. Procedure went ok. The location of the mass makes inoperable [sic]. I have \nan appointment on Thursday to discuss plan ‘B’.”  (PSMF  ¶¶ 13-14; ECF 97, Declaration of Tyrone \nBlackburn5 (“Blackburn Decl.”); ECF 97 -8, Blackburn Decl. Ex. H.) On the same day, Charlie \nCreighton responded: “So very sorry. Do you plan to update your Associates ? Already done it? \nWant us to do it?” ( Id.) Plaintiff replied, “ [I] will update my associates when I have plan ‘B’.” ( Id.) \nPlaintiff testified that his doctors recommended proton treatment for his cancer diagnosis; the  \ntreatment was scheduled to begin on August 19, 2019. (DSMF ¶ 22; ECF 95 -4, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. \nC, Kertesz Dep. Tr., at 187:16- 188:5, 202:14- 24.)  \nOn August 19, 2019, Plaintiff reached out to Colony Tire’s  Human Resources Manager, \nAdora Ambrose, to ask about  FMLA leave. (DSMF ¶ 24; ECF 95 -6, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. N.) \n \n5 The Court disregards improper legal and factual arguments contained in the Declaration of Tyrone Blackburn.  Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 3 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>4 Kertesz stated, in part, “Just spoke with Scott he said that  I need to go out on FMLA6 because it’s \nrequired by law and the insurance. How does this all work as far as pay? ” (ECF 95 -6, DeBlasio \nCert. Ex. N at D -00076.) Ambrose replied to Plaintiff on the same day and included details about \npayment and health benefits during FMLA leave . (Id. at D-00075. ) After some exchanges back \nand forth, on August 26, 2019, Plaintiff wrote to Ambrose again, stating in part, “I gave the FMLA \npapers to my doctor for certification. I hope to have them back soon so that  I can get them back to \nyou ASAP.” ( Id. at D -00074.)  \nOn August 28, 2019, Colony Tire received the “Certification of Health Care Provider for \nEmployee’s Serious Health Condition” in support of Plaintiff’s need for FMLA leave . (DSMF ¶ \n26; ECF 95 -6, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. Q, “FMLA Certification”.) Plaintiff’s request for FMLA leave \nwas granted on September 4, 2019. (DSMF ¶ 26; ECF 95 -7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. R.) Although \nColony Tire provide d Plaintiff with an application for short -term disability benefits, Plaintiff did \nnot return the application. (DSMF ¶ 25.) After Plaintiff was diagnosed with cancer, individual \nDefendants Charlie Creighton and Scott Creighton sent the following emails that contained  \ninformation about Plaintiff:  \n• On July 23, 2019, Scott Creighton replied to a  work -related  email with ten recipients, \nincluding Plaintiff, advising that “Erik is meeting with doctors to treat his newfound \ncancer” (DSMF ¶ 21; ECF 95 -6, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. L  (“July 23, 2019 Email”) ; PSMF ¶ \n15; ECF 97 -16, Blackburn Cert. Ex. P .) \n \n• On August 16, 2019, Charlie Creighton sent an email to “all users” within Colony Tire , \nstating, “Erik Kertesz has been diagnosed with a cancer tumor behind his throat. He will begin treatment Aug. 19 at U Penn Hospital. Please [ keep ] him and his family in your \nprayers. God Bless them.” (DSMF ¶ 23; ECF 95 -6, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. M (“August 16, \n2019 Email”) ; PSMF ¶ 16; ECF 97 -2, Blackburn Cert. Ex. B .) \n \n• On September 11, 2019, Scott Creighton emailed one vendor and Plaintiff, stating, “Erik \nis out until sometime in October being treated for a cancerous tumor in [h]is throat. That week is not good for me. let [sic] me  look at calendar and get back to you. thanks [sic].” \n \n6 “FMLA ” refers to the Family Medical Leave Act , 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601 et seq.  Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 4 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>5 (DSMF ¶ 27; ECF 95 -7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. S  (“September 11, 2019 Email”) ; PSMF ¶ 17; \nECF 97 -3, Blackburn Cert. Ex. C.)  \n \n• On October 7, 2019, one outside sales representative emailed Plaintiff and Scott Creighton \nasking for a time to meet. (DSMF ¶ 29; ECF 95- 7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. U (“October 7, 2019 \nEmail”); PSMF ¶ 19; ECF 97 -4, Blackburn Cert. Ex. D.) Scott Creighton replied  to the \nsales representative and Plaintiff, stating that Plaintiff was “still out finishing up chemo \nand radiation for cancer.” ( Id.) \n \n• On October 18, 2019, Scott Creighton sent an email to Atlantic@colonytire.com ,7 \nproviding notice that the C olony Tire  planned to postpone an Atlantic Tire Incentive trip \nfor customers  (the “Incentive Trip”) . (DSMF ¶ 30;  ECF 95 -7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. V \n(“October 18, 2019 Email”); PSMF ¶¶ 20- 21; ECF 97- 5, Blackburn Cert. Ex. E.) In \nexplaining the reasons for the cancelation of the Atlantic Tire Incentive Trip , Scott \nCreighton wrote, in part, that he did a “terrible job” taking Plaintiff’s place while Plaintiff  \nwas out with his “illnesses  this year .” (Id.) Scott Creighton further stated, “Please try to \nexplain what our circumstances have been this year if and when you need to tell your \ncustomer about the postponement. Thanks.” ( Id.) \n \nOn November 7, 2019, Plaintiff submitted a doctor’s note clearing him to return to work \non November 11, 2019, and Plaintiff returned  to work on that  date. (DSMF ¶ 31; ECF 95 -7, \nDeBlasio Cert. Exs. W, X.)  On November 14, 2019, Plaintiff emailed Scott Creighton, copying \nCharlie Creighton and Andrew Bergeron regarding the Atlantic Tire Incentive Trip. (PSMF ¶ 22.) \nPlaintiff wrote, in part:  \nI also want to mention the fact I am very upset with the uncomfortable situation that you have created for me regarding this trip. Not only is it unprofessional and poor customer \nservice to cancel an incentive trip on such short notice but, the fact that you told everyone \ninvolved that it was “due to my illnesses” and to “ please explain the circumstances” is \ncompletely unacceptable. Obviously, the customers, salespeople, and vendors were going to be unhappy with the decision and clearly, they were since the  trip was reinstated. My \nhealth is my private business and I’m not ok with you using me as an excuse just because \nsomeone else did not take over the task while I was out on FMLA.  (ECF 97 -10, Blackburn \nCert. Ex. J.)  \n \n \n7 Plaintiff’s Statement of Undisputed Material Fact (PSMF) states that the October 18, 2019 email was sent to “over \n200 employees.” (PSMF ¶  21.) The email dated October 18, 2019 does not identify the number of recipients. Scott \nCreighton testified that the “Atlantic@colonytire.com” email address includes only 15 to 20 management level and \nsales employees of Atlantic Tire, including Plaintiff. ( See ECF 97 -9, Blackburn Decl. Ex. I, S.  Creighton Dep. T r., at \n74:22- 75:6. ) Plaintiff  has not disputed this testimony, nor has Plaintiff cited any evidence in support of his contention \nthat this email address includes over 200 employees. The Court therefore treats Scott Creighton’s testimony as uncontested.  Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 5 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>6 On November 20, 2019, Plaintiff missed one day of work for a medical appointment in \nNew Jersey. (DSMF ¶ 33.) On the same day, Plaintiff emailed Charlie Creighton, Scott Creighton, \nand Andrew Bergeron with the subject line, “Update.” ( ECF 95 -7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. Z.) In that \nemail, Plaintiff stated: “ I have developed lymphedema [sic] . It does [not] impact my ability to \nwork but requires that I receive weekly treatment. I will arrange to have this done in NC.” ( Id. at \nD-00138.) Plaintiff forwarded the email t o Adora Ambrose, clarifying that the appointments w ould \nnot impact “working.” ( Id.) In response, Ambrose replied, “ I am happy to hear that your condition \nwill not affect your ability to work. Upon your return to work, please come meet with me so that \nwe may discuss any potential accommodation that you may need.” ( Id.)  \nPlaintiff replied to Ambrose the same day, informing her that “[a]s of right now the only \naccommodation that I will potentially need is flexibility in my work schedule so that I can attend weekly appointments.” ( Id. at D-00137.) Plaintiff also stated, “ Currently, I have not decided on \nwhich specialist I  will be seeing nor have I scheduled any appointments so, I do not know what \nappointment times are available or what flexibility might be needed. ” (Id.) Less than 24 hours \nlater, Plaintiff wrote to Adora again, stating, “ Just wanted to make sure that you received this .  \n[sic] Will this be an issue? ” (Id.) The same day, on November 21, 2019, Ambrose replied  that she \n“cannot determine if there will be an issue based on the information you have provided. ” (Id.) Her \nemail continued, “[a] s I stated before, please come see me upon your return to Edenton [North \nCarolina] , and we can discuss your accommodation needs further. If you need information before \nyour arrival, please feel free to call me directly. ” (Id.) \nThe next day, on November 22, 2019, Plaintiff wrote to Ambrose in the same email chain, \nasking if she would be “docking” his pay for the time he was at his follow -up appointment given \nthat he “used up” his paid vacation and sick days when he was “forced to go out on FMLA.” ( Id.) Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 6 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>7 Ambrose replied: “Yes[.]” ( Id. at D-00136.) Plaintiff replied, asking how many hours were being \nwithheld, and asking Ambrose to “ please explain why this is the first -time that senior management \nhas decided to handle it this way” since he was “ out numerous times  this past year for doctor \nappointments and [his] pay was not withheld.” ( Id.) Plaintiff also noted that he “ continue [s] to \nwork remotely answering calls, emails, etc. ” (Id.) Ambrose replied by asking Plaintiff, “How many \nhours have you missed this pay period? As I  previously stated, please come see me upon your \nreturn and we can discuss and clarify further. ” (Id.) Also on November 22, 2019, Plaintiff reiterated \nhis concern that his pay was previously not withheld, and further stated, “ [b]ased on your previ ous \nemail responses and the current situation all communication regarding my concerns will be done \nin writing. I have no intention of discussing anything related to this situation unless  I have counsel \npresent, or the conversation is recorded.” ( Id.) \nOn November 24, 2019, Plaintiff sent Ambrose and Charlie Creighton an email regarding \nthe exhaustion of his vacation and sick pay. (DSMF ¶ 35.) In the email, Plaintiff stated: “ I’ll be \nextremely clear since you are supposedly confused by my question. I specifically asked you why \nmy pay was docked this week, when it has never been docked this year, despite the circumstances being the same. ” (ECF 95 -8, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. AA.)  He continued, in relevant part,  \nClaiming that you are “completely unaware of that time you have taken off thus far” is \nabsurd and a blatant lie. Since January of 2019 to date, there have been numerous, consecutive periods of times when I have been away from the office, working under the \nsame circumstances  . . . I  did not “elect to leave without pay” this week, as you claim. \nRather, as I have in the past, I reported my time away and continued to carry out my job \nresponsibilities during my time out of the office . (Id.) \n \nThe next day, on November 25, 2019, a little over two weeks after Plaintiff returned from FMLA \nleave, Charlie Creighton sent Plaintiff a notice that Colony Tire had terminated Plaintiff’s employment  (the “Termination Letter”) . (DSMF ¶ 36; PSMF ¶¶ 35-36.) The Termination Letter \nstated, in part, “ I was very disappointed to read your most recent email to Adora in which you Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 7 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>8 talked down to her and called her a liar when she was merely trying to do her job.” ( ECF 95 -8, \nDeBlasio Cert. Ex. BB.)  It continued, “ it has been two weeks since you returned to work and you \nhave not even met with or discussed face -to-face anything with any member of our senior \nmanagement. ” (Id.) \n Plaintiff filed his Complaint in New Jersey state court on August 5, 2020. (ECF 1, \n“Compl .”) The Complaint includes claims for common law invasion of privacy against Colony \nTire (Count One), Charl ie Creighton (Count Two), and Scott Creighton (Count Three , together \nwith Counts One and Two, the “Invasion of Privacy Claims” ); Failure to Accommodate in \nviolation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (“NJLAD”), N.J. Stat. Ann 10:5- 1, et \nseq., against all Defendants (Count Four ); and Aiding and Abetting in violation of the New Jersey \nLaw Against Discrimination, 10:5 -12(e) , against Charl ie Creighton and Scott Creighton (together, \nthe “Creightons”) (Count Five). (ECF 1 ; ECF 95 -4, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. A .) On September 4, 2020, \nDefendants removed this action to federal court. ( Id.) On September 11, 2020, Defendants moved \nto transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. (ECF 2.) \nOn June 14, 2021, Magistrate Judge James B. Clark issued a Report and Recommendation denying Defendants’ motion t o transfer (ECF 15), which the Court adopted on January 3, 2022. ( ECF 22.) \nThroughout the course of this litigation, Plaintiff moved to amend the Complaint three separate times.\n8 (ECF 41 ; ECF 48 ; ECF 75.) Plaintiff’s first two motions to amend were denied; he \nwithdrew the third. (ECF 47; ECF  62; ECF 81 .)  \nOn December 20, 2024, Defendants and Plaintiff filed respective motions for summary \njudgment (ECF 95, Defendants’ Motion; ECF 96 , Plaintiff’s Motion .) Each moved for summary \n \n8 Notably, in Plaintiff’s second motion to amend the Complaint (ECF 48), Plaintiff attempted to add claims  for, among \nothers,  “ADA Disability Discrimination”; “ADA Disability Retaliation”; FMLA “Involuntary Leave”; and \n“Retaliation  under the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. ” (ECF 48 -3.)  Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 8 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>9 judgment on all of Plaintiff’s claims. ( See id.) On January 17, 2025, Defendants filed an opposition \nto Plaintiff’s Motion. (ECF 99, Defs. Opp. )9 On the same day, Plaintiff filed an opposition to \nDefendant s’ Motion (ECF 100, Pl. Opp.) and an “Affidavit in Opposition” to the exhibits attached \nto the DeBlasio Certification in support of Defendants’ Motion (ECF 101).10 The following day, \nJanuary 18, 2025, Plaintiff filed a Response to Defendants’ Statement of Undisputed Material \nFacts. (ECF 102.)  On January 27, 2025, Defendants filed a reply in further support of their Motion. \n(ECF 103, Defs. Reply ) and a responding statement of undisputed material facts (ECF 103- 1). \nAlso on January 27, 2025, Plaintiff filed a reply in further support of his Motion (ECF 104) and a \nsupplemental statement of undisputed material facts responding to Defendants’ objections  (ECF \n105). Because Plaintiff’s filing at ECF 104 did not conform to Local Civil Rule  7.2, the Court \nallowed Plaintiff to filing a conforming reply (ECF 108), which Plaintiff filed on February 7, 2025. (ECF 109, Pl. Reply.)\n11 \nOn July 24, 2025, Plaintiff ’s attorney  filed a “Notice of Errata” to correct erroneous citation \nand quotation errors contained in all four briefs Plaintiff filed in support of his Motion for summary \njudgment and in opposition to Defendants’ Motion for summary judgment . (ECF 114.) In this \nopinion, the Court  will not consider Plaintiff’s amended briefs  or the errata at ECF 114. Instead,  \n \n9 Defendants appear to have erroneously filed two copies of their memorandum in opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion; \nthe Certification of Michael A. Tecza in Support of Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment ; and Exhibit A to the \nTecza Certification. ( See ECF 98, ECF 99.) Because ECF 99 also includes Defendants’  Response to Plaintiff’s \nStatement of Undisputed Material Facts (ECF 99 -1), the Court considers ECF 99  the operative filing for purposes of \nthis opinion.  \n10 Plaintiff’s “Affidavit in Opposition” (ECF 101) includes argument and appears to function as a supplemental brief ; \ntherefore, it is not in compliance with Fed R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4 ) and L. Civ. R. 56.1 . Because Plaintiff also filed a brief \nin opposition to Defendants’ Motion (ECF 100), the Court does not consider Plaintiff’s “Affidavit in Opposition” in \nthis opinion.  \n11 The Court treats the filing at ECF 109 as Plaintiff’s operative Reply in Further Support of its Motion for Summary \nJudgment.  Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 9 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>10 the Court treats any propositions or arguments supported by incorrect or made -up citations as \nunsupported.12  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a)  provides that summary judgment should be granted \nif the movant shows that “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Kreschollek v. S. Stevedoring Co., 223 F.3d 202, 204 (3d \nCir. 2000);  see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). In deciding a \nmotion for summary judgment, a court must construe all facts and inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  See Boyle v. Cnty. of Allegheny Pa., 139 F.3d 386, 393 (3d Cir. \n1998)  (citing  Peters v. Del. River Port Auth. of Pa. & N.J., 16 F.3d 1346, 1349 (3d Cir. 1994)). \nThe moving party bears the burden of establishing that no genuine issue of material fact remains. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 322- 23 (1986). “[W]ith respect to an issue on which \nthe nonmoving party bears the burden of proof . . . the burden on the moving party may be \ndischarged by ‘showing’ — that is, pointing out to the district court — that there is an absence of \nevidence to support t he nonmoving party’s case.”  Id. at 325.  \nOnce the moving party has met that threshold burden, the non- moving party “must do more \nthan simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.”  Matsushita Elec. \n \n12 The errors were the result of Plaintiff’s  attorney’s  use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) tools. ( See ECF 114.) As \nMagistrate Judge José R. Almonte has recently recognized, “[u]nfortunately, attorneys’ use of generative AI without \nproper oversight has become a prevalent issue for courts across the country . . . those who rely on AI blindly, do so at \ntheir own peril.” OTG New York, Inc. v. OTTOGI Am., Inc. , No. 24 -CV-07209, 2025 WL 2671460, at *2 (D.N.J. Sept. \n18, 2025) (imposing monetary sanctions for party’s use of AI in briefing).  Given Plaintiff’s attorney’s self -disclosure \nof his use of AI, along with his representation that he has taken continuing legal education courses on the topic , the \nCourt declines to impose sanctions at this time. ( See ECF 114.) The Court does, however, caution Plaintiff ’s attorney: \nproviding submissions to the Court with inaccurate and false information violates the New Jersey Rules of Professional \nConduct. See, e.g. , New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct  3.1, 4.1(a)(1), 8.4(c), and 3.3. It is sanctionable conduct. \nSee OTG , 2025 WL 2671460. In the event Plaintiff’s attorney relies on AI without proper oversight again, the Court \nwill not likely be so lenient.  \n  Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 10 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>11 Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986). A fact is only “material” for \npurposes of a summary judgment motion if a dispute over that fact “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.”  Anderson, 477 U.S. at  248. A dispute about a material fact is \n“genuine” if “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.”   Id.  Unsupported allegations, subjective beliefs, or argument alone, however, cannot \nforestall summary judgment.  See Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n , 497 U.S. 871, 888 \n(1988)  (nonmoving party may not successfully oppose summary judgment motion by simply \nreplacing “conclusory allegations of the complaint or answer with conclusory allegations of an affidavit.”). Thus, if the nonmoving party fails “to ma ke a showing sufficient to establish the \nexistence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial . . . there can be ‘no genuine issue of material fact,’ since a com plete failure of \nproof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.”  Katz v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 972 F.2d 53, 55 (3d Cir. 1992)  (quoting Celotex, \n477 U.S. at 322- 23). Moreover, the “mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the \nparties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247- 48. \nIII. ANALYSIS   \nA. Invasion of Privacy Claims (Counts One, Two, and Three)   \nThe parties both argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on the Invasion of \nPrivacy Claims , which arise under New Jersey law . (See Defs. Br. at 5 -13; Pl. Br. at 11- 17.) \nPlaintiff’s Invasion of Privacy C laims are premised on Charlie and Scott Creighton’s July 23, \n2019;  August 16, 2019; September 11, 2019; October 7, 2019;  and October 18, 2019 Emails  \n(together, the “2019 Emails”) , which referenced Plaintiff’s “cancer” and “illnesses .” (See Compl. Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 11 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>12 ¶¶ 67-90; Pl. Br. at 7- 9, 11- 17; ECF 95 -6, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. L; ECF 95- 6, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. M; \nECF 95 -7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. S; ECF 95- 7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. U; ECF 95- 7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. \nV.) New Jersey Courts recognize a common law action for invasion of privacy. See Romaine v. \nKallinger , 109 N.J. 282, 297- 98 (1988). Under New Jersey law,  the tort of invasion of privacy \nencompasses four scenarios:  \n(1) intrusion (e.g., intrusion on plaintiff's physical solitude or seclusion, as by invading his \nor her home, illegally searching, eavesdropping, or prying into personal affairs); (2) public disclosure of private facts (e.g., making public private informat ion about plaintiff); (3) \nplacing plaintiff in a false light in the public eye (which need not be defamatory, but must be something that would be objectionable to the ordinary reasonable person); and (4) appropriation, for the defendant ’s benefit, of the p laintiff's name or likeness.  \n \nRumbauskas v. Cantor , 649 A.2d 853 ( N.J. 1994).  \nPlaintiff alleges that Defendants committed the tort of  invasion of privacy based on the \nsecond scenario , public disclosure of private facts. ( Pl. Br. at 12- 13.) The  tort of invasion of privacy \nby publication of private facts involves the following elements:  “[1] the matters revealed were \nactually private,  [2] dissemination of such facts would be offensive to a reasonable person, and [3]  \nthere is no legitimate interest of the public in being apprised of the facts publicized.” Romaine , \n109 N.J. at  297 (internal quotation omitted) . \nDefendants argue that summary judgment in their favor is warranted on the Invasion of \nPrivacy Claims because (1) Plaintiff consented to the disclosures  in the 2019 Emails ; (2) the \n“publicity” of the 2019 Emails  is insufficient to support an unlawful invasion of privacy; and (3) \nno reasonable person would find the 2019 Emails offensive. ( Defs. Br.  at 6-13; Defs. Opp. at 6-\n16; Defs. Reply at 3 -10.) Conversely, Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to summary judgment  \nbecause (1) Defendants revealed Plaintiff’s private medical information publicly; (2) the \nunauthorized dissemination of this information would be “deeply offensive” to a reasonable Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 12 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>13 person; (3) there was a lack of legitimate public concern in sharing the information; and (4) \nPlaintiff did not consent to the disclosures. (Pl. Br. at  11-17; Pl. Reply at 7 -8.)  \nAs an initial matter, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff cannot maintain a cause \nof action for invasion of privacy based on disclosures in the July 23, 2019, September 11, 2019, \nOctober 7, 2019, and October 18, 2019 Emails. But there is a genuine issue of material fact as to \nwhether the August 16, 2019 Email constituted an invasion of privacy without Plaintiff’s consent. \n1. The July 23, 2019, September 11, 2019, October 7, 2019, and October 18, \n2019 Emails  \n \nBased on the undisputed facts in this case, the July 23, 2019, September 11, 2019, October \n7, 2019, and October 18, 2019 Emails do not as a matter of law constitute an invasion of privacy \nbecause Plaintiff cannot satisfy the publicity requirement for these emails.  Restatement (Second) \nof Torts  defines “publicity” as  “[a] matter [that] is made public, by communicating it to the public \nat large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become \none of public knowledge  . . . Thus it is not an invasion of the right to privacy . . . to communicate \na fact concerning the plaintiff's private life to a single person or even to a small group of persons.”  \nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 652D, Comment (a ). See also Hamza v. United Cont'l Holdings, \nLLC, No. 19- 8971, 2021 WL 3206814, at *4 (D.N.J. July 29, 2021) (citing McNemar v. Disney \nStore, Inc., 91 F.3d 610, 622 (3d Cir. 1996) ) (“In New Jersey, publication means that information \nis ‘communicat[ed] to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded \nas substantially certain to become one of public knowledge  . . . .’” ).  \n Here,  it is undisputed that  the July 23, 2019 Email had nine  recipients in addition to \nPlaintiff; the September 11, 2019 Email and October 7, 2019 Email each had one recipient in \naddition to Plaintiff; and the October 18, 2019 Email had fifteen to twenty recipients. (See ECF \n95-6, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. L; ECF 95- 7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. S; ECF 95- 7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. U ; Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 13 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>14 ECF 95 -7, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. V .) Dissemination to a single individual or a small group “is far  \nfrom communicating to a large enough group such that [Plaintiff’s] information became public \nknowledge.”  Foley v. Medicredit, Inc. , No. 21 -19764, 2022 WL 3020129, at *3 (D.N.J. July 29, \n2022)  (citing Hamza , 2021 WL 3206814, at *10 ). Based on these numbers, t he Court finds that \nthe July 23, 2019;  September 11, 2019; October 7, 2019; and October 18, 2019 Emails , which \nwere sent to either a single individua l or a small group, do not meet the “publicity” requirement \nfor the tort of invasion of privacy and thus  cannot sustain Plaintiff’s Invasion of Privacy Claims. \n2. The August  16, 2019 Email  \n \nThe final email that forms  the basis of Plaintiff’s Invasion of Privacy Claims is the  August \n16, 2019 Email  from Charlie Creighton, which states, “Erik Kertesz has been diagnosed with a \ncancer tumor behind his throat. He will begin treatment Aug. 19 at U Penn Hospital. Please [keep] \nhim and his family in your prayers. God bless them.” (DSMF ¶ 23; ECF 95 -6, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. \nM; PSMF  ¶ 16; ECF 97 -2, Blackburn Cert. Ex. B .) There are issues of material fact with respect \nto this email, and the Court cannot conclude at this stage whether it was an invasion of privacy as a matter of law . \nUnlike the other 2019 Emails, the August 16, 2019 Email was sent to two hundred people, \nall employees of Colony Tire. ( Defs. Br. at 10; Defs. Opp. at 9 (citing S. Creighton Dep. Tr. at \n122:24- 123:3) ; Pl. Br. at 12.)  This number can satisf y the publicity requirement of Plaintiff’s \ninvasion of privacy claim. Even though the recipients of the August 16, 2019 Email were Plaintiff’s coworkers, given the number of recipients, the Court is not persuaded that  Defendants did not give \n“sufficient publicity” to any of Plaintiff’s private health information.  (Defs. Opp. at 10; see also \nid. at 15 ; Defs. Reply at 4- 5 (noting that all of the email recipients were internal to Colony Tire \nwith the exception of two individual vendors ).) Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 14 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>15  As to the other elements of the tort, the August 16, 2019 Email also includes private \ninformation. A lthough Plaintiff’s contention that “medical information , especially relating to \nserious conditions like cancer, is among the most sensitive  categories of personal information” is \nuncited ( Pl. Br. at 12), Defendants tellingly do not explicitly contest that Plaintiff’s cancer \ndiagnosis and treatment information were private. ( See Defs. Br. at 5 -13; Defs. Opp. at 7- 16.) The \nCourt finds that the information shared in the August 16, 2019 Email can be considered private. \nSee Restatement (Second) of Torts § 652D (1977) ( categorizing “many unpleasant or disgraceful \nor humiliating illnesses” as “normally entirely private matters”).   \nHowever , “there is no liability for giving further publicity to what the plaintiff himself \nleaves open to the public eye.”  Id. Here, there are disputed issues of material fact regarding \nPlaintiff’s consent to the disclosures, which precludes this Court from concluding that Plaintiff had a reasonable privacy interest and  that the dissemination of information  in the August 16, 2019 \nEmail “would [or would not] be offensive to a reasonable person.” Romaine , 109 N.J. at 297; see \nalso Christie v. Nat ’l Inst. for Newman Stud., No. 16- 6572, 2019 WL 1916204, at *12 (D.N.J. Apr. \n30, 2019) (quoting Stengart v. Loving Care Agency, Inc., 990 A.2d 650, 660 (N.J. 2010) ) \n(“[W]hether an employee has a reasonable expectation of privacy in [his/her] particular work setting must be addressed on a case -by-case basis.”) .\n \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff consented to the disclosures made in the 2019 Emails, \nincluding the August 16, 2019 Email, and Plaintiff “ cannot allege that he had a privacy interest \nsince he made no effort to keep the information confidential.” (Defs. Br. at 12.) Whether Plaintiff did or did not consent to the disclosure of the information contained in any of the 2019 Emails, \nincluding (as relevant here) the August 16, 2019 Email , is an issue of fact  that is in dispute.  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff (1) provided express consent at the time of his heart attack and (2) Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 15 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>16 provided implied consent when he received the 2019 Emails and did not voice his objections to \nthem until he complained about being blamed for the cancelation of the Incentive Trip. (Defs. Br. \nat 13 ; Defs. Reply at 6 -8.) Plaintiff disagrees.  (See Pl. Opp. at 6, 9; Pl. Reply at 11.)  \nAs to express consent, the parties’ version of events conflict. In support of their position, \nDefendants point to the January 30, 2019 and February 28, 2019 text messages between Scott Creighton and Plaintiff, in which Plaintiff expressly gave consent for Scott Creighton to send emails to “all users” with updates regarding Plaintiff’s heart attack. ( See ECF 95 -5, DeBlasio Cert. \nExs. I, J.) Defendants argue that this consent was ongoing through Plaintiff’s cancer treatment and \ndiagnosis. ( Defs. Br. at 7; Defs. Opp. at 8; Defs. Reply at 6- 8.) In contrast, Plaintiff maintains that \nthose  disclosures were limited to the details of his heart attack and did not extend to disclosures \nregarding his cancer. (Pl. Br. at 14; see also ECF 95 -4, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. C, Kertesz Dep. Tr. , at \n373:22- 380:15 (testimony that  Plaintiff  did not give Charlie and Scott Creighton permission to \ndisclose his cancer treatment and diagnosis).)  \nThere are also issues of fact as to whether Plaintiff impliedly consented to the disclosure s \nin the August 16, 2019 Email. On July 9, 2019, Charlie Creighton emailed Plaintiff, copying Scott \nCreighton, in response to Plaintiff’s cancer diagnosis: “So very sorry. Do you plan to update your Associates ? Already done it? Want us to do it?” ( ECF 97 -8, Blackburn Decl.  Ex. H.) Plaintiff \nreplied, “I will update my associates when I have [ a] plan ‘B’ [.]” (Id.) Whether Plaintiff’s message \nwas intended to stop the Creightons from disseminating any information about his diagnosis  is \nambiguous, especially in light of Plaintiff’s subsequent failure to timely  object to the 2019 Emails. \nSpecifically, Plaintiff received the 2019 Emails on  July 23, 2019; August 16, 2019; September 11, \n2019; October 7, 2019; and October 18, 2019 disclosing Plaintiff’s  cancer diagnosis. But Plaintiff \ndid not object to the disclosure of that information until November 14, 2019—three months after Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 16 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>17 the August 16, 2019 email —when Plaintiff emailed Scott Creighton, copying Charlie Creighton \nand Andrew Bergeron regarding the Atlantic Tire Incentive Trip. (PSMF ¶ 22; ECF 97 -10, \nBlackburn Cert. Ex. J.) In that email, Plaintiff took issue with what he viewed as Scott Creighton \n“using [Plaintiff] as an excuse” to cancel the Incentive Trip, noting that “[m]y health is my private business[.]” ( ECF 97 -10, Blackburn Cert. Ex. J.)  Plaintiff testified that he did not object to the \ninitial email he received on July  23, 2019 because he was “intimidated by the way they [Scott and \nCharlie] were acting” ; he was “embarrassed”;  and because “there is a stigma with people who have \ncancer in the workplace.” ( ECF 95 -4, DeBlasio Cert. Ex. C, Kertesz Dep. Tr. , at 151:15- 20.) \nBased on the foregoing, the Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material fact in \ndispute related to Plaintiff ’s invasion of privacy claims against Charl ie Creighton and Colony \nTire,\n13 and Defendants ’ and Plaintiff’s motion s for summary judgment as to Count s One and Two \nare DENIED. Because the emails Defendant Scott Creighton sent do not satisfy the publicity \nrequirement for an invasion of privacy claim, see supra Section III.A.1, Defendants’ motion for summary judgment is  GRANTED as to Count Three, invasion of privacy, against Scott Creighton. \nPlaintiff’s motion for summary judgment as to Count Three is  DENIED.  \nB. NJLAD Failure to Accommodate (Count Four ) \nBoth Plaintiff and Defendants also move for summary judgment on Plaintiff’s claim that  \nDefendants failed to accommodate Plaintiff under the NJLAD. ( See Defs. Br. at 13- 16; Pl. Br. at \n17-22.) Plaintiff argues that Defendants violated the NJLAD by failing to make accommodations \nfor Plaintiff’s disability, namely his cancer and lymphedema, which occurred as a result of his \n \n13 To the extent that Plaintiff attempts to brings a claim under HIPAA  (the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1320d– 1 et seq. ) against Defendants, however, “that claim cannot go forward as \nHIPAA creates no private federal remedy.” Wolf v. New Jersey, No. 17 -2072, 2018 WL 1942522, at *6 (D.N.J. Apr. \n23, 2018) .

Ex. M , Bergeron Dep. Tr., at 31:18- 32:4 (testifying that Plaintiff was \nterminated because he did not come to the office to discuss “anything” with senior management, including Scott Creighton) .)  \n2. Other NJLAD Claims  \nPlaintiff and Defendants dispute whether this action involves other NJLAD claims in \naddition to the failure to accommodate claim. ( See Defs. Opp. at 5- 6; Pl. Reply at 6- 7.) The Court \nagrees with Defendants that Plaintiff’s case  does not  include claims under the NJLAD for (1) \nretaliation ; (2) disability discrimination ; (3) wrongful discharge; or (4 ) any other NJLAD claims \nother than failure to accommodate (Count Four ) and aiding and abetting (Count Five ). (See Defs. \nOpp. at 5- 6.) Plaintiff’s Complaint plainly does not include claims  for retaliation  or discrimination \nbased on Plaintiff’s discharge . “Adding claims to a pleading is properly done by amending the \ncomplaint; it is too late to introduce an additional claim at the summary judgment stage .” Tirone \nv. Trella , No. 03- 257, 2007 WL 3170098, at *6 (D.N.J. Oct. 29, 2007)  (citations omitted) ; see also \nBalanced Bridge Funding, LLC v. Mitnick L. Off., LLC , No. 21-  20512, 2024 WL 3949334, at *5 \n(D.N.J. Aug. 27, 2024) (“Because plaintiff advances a different cause of action in its motion for summary judgment than that alleged in its amended complaint… I decline to consider plaintiff's \nnew legal theory for the first time at summary judgment. ”); St. Martin v. W. Windsor Twp. Police \nDep’t, 753 F. Supp. 3d 369, 400–01 (D.N.J. 2024) (quoting Jones v. Treece, 774 F. App ’x 65, 67 \n(3d Cir. 2019)) (“As a general matter, a plaintiff  ‘may not amend his complaint through arguments \nin his brief in opposition to a motion for summary judgment.’”)  The Court rejects Plaintiff’s Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 23 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>24 attempts to shoehorn these claims in now, when Plaintiff, who is represented by counsel, should \nhave included them at the pleading stage.  \n3. Defendants Charlie Creighton and Scott Creighton \nAlthough there are genuine issues of material fact as to Colony Tire, Plaintiff cannot as a \nmatter of law maintain this cause of action against Defendants Charlie Creighton and Scott Creighton. See Cicchetti v. Morris Cnty. Sheriff's Off. , 947 A.2d 626, 645 ( N.J. 2008)  (citations \nomitted)  (“[T]he plain meaning of the definition of employer in the LAD does not include a \nsupervisor”); see also Tarr v. Ciasulli , 853 A.2d 921, 924 ( N.J. 2004) (assessing claim against \nowner of Defendant company pursuant to NJLAD aiding- and-abetting liability).  \nBased on the foregoing, the Court DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion for summary as to Count \nFour. The Court further DENIES Colony Tire’s motion for summary judgment as to Count Four, \nand GRANTS  Defendants Charlie Creighton and Scott Creighton’s motion for summary judgment \nas to Count Four.  \nC. NJLAD Aiding and Abetting  (Count 5)  \nDefendants and Plaintiff also respectively move for summary judgment on Count 5 of the \nComplaint, Aiding and Abetting under the NJLAD (N.J. Stat. Ann. 10:5- 12(e)) against the \nindividual Defendants  Charlie and Scott Creighton. Defendants argue that as the alleged “primary \nwrongdoers,” Scott and Charlie Creighton cannot be liable to Plaintiff for aiding and abetting the wrongful conduct. (Defs. Br. at 17.) Plaintiff argues that he is entitled to summary judgment against the Crei ghtons for aiding and abetting under the NJLAD because the Creightons provided \nknowing and substantial assistance in violating New Jersey’s common law privacy protections and NJLAD v iolations. (Pl. Br. at 27- 33.) Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 24 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>25 Individuals , including supervisors, may be liable under the NJLAD only insofar as they aid \nor abet an employer ’s discrimination, and not for their direct acts. See Cicchetti , 947 A.2d at  645 \n(“[I]ndividual liability of a supervisor for acts of discrimination or for creating or maintaining a \nhostile environment can only arise through the ‘aiding and abetting’ mechanism that applies to ‘any person.’”) (citing N.J. Stat. Ann. § 10:5- 12(e)).  \nTo hold an individual defendant liable as an aider or abettor of employment discrimination \nunder the NJLAD, a plaintiff must show that “(1) the employer whom the defendant aids must perform a wrongful act that causes an injury; (2) the defendant must be ge nerally aware of [his] \nrole as part of an overall illegal or tortious activity at the time that [he] provides the assistance; \nand (3) the defendant must knowingly and substantially assist the principal violation.” O ’Shea v. \nTwp. of Hillside , No. 20- 7027, 2022 WL 17829402, at *5 (D.N.J. Dec. 21, 2022) ( citations \nomitted ) (cleaned up) . \nThe Court limits its discussion to whether the Creightons aided and abetted Colony Tire in \nits potential failure to accommodate Plaintiff under the NJLAD.\n18 The Court denies Defendants’ \nand Plaintiff’s motions for summary judgment on this cause of action because there are issues of fact as to whether the Creightons were “generally aware of [thei r] role as part of an overall illegal \nor tortious activity ” and whether they “ knowingly and substantially assist the principal violation.” \nO’Shea, 2022 WL 17829402, at *5. Moreover, contrary to Defendants’ position, “ courts both in \nthis district and New Jersey state courts have held that individually named defendants can be held \npersonally liable for their own conduct under the aiding and abetting provision of the NJLAD .” \n \n18 As discussed in Section III.B.2 , supra , claims for retaliation and discrimination against Colony Tire are not a part \nof this lawsuit and so the Court also  does not consider liability for aiding and abetting those violations . Additionally, \nit is unlawful under the NJLAD “[f]or any person, whether an employer or an employee or not, to aid, abet, incite, \ncompel or coerce the doing of any of the acts forbidden under this act , or to attempt to do so.” N.J. Stat. Ann. 10:5-\n12(e) (emphasis added). Common law invasion of privacy does not arise under the NJLAD and therefore the \nCreightons cannot be held liable for aiding and abetting alleged common law privacy violations pursuant to N.J. Stat. \nAnn. 10:5- 12(e).  Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 25 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>26 Johnson v. Glob. Equip. Co., Inc., No. 24- 08789, 2025 WL 2654995, at *3 (D.N.J. Sept. 17, 2025)  \n(citations omitted).  \nThere  are genuine issues of  material fact as to whether the Creightons aided or abetted \nColony Tire in failing to accommodate Plaintiff after he returned from FMLA leave, specifically \nas to time off that Plaintiff  may have needed for his doctor’s appointment on November 20, 2019, \nand for his subsequent doctor’s appointments for lymphedema treatment. For example, Charlie \nCreighton testified that Plaintiff would be responsible for informing Ambrose that he needed to take time off work. ( ECF 97 -12, Blackburn C ert. Ex. L, C. Creighton Dep. Tr., at 52:6- 11.) \nHowever, in Plaintiff’s November 20, 2019 email to Charlie Creighton, Scott Creighton, and \nAndrew Bergeron, he informed them of his  lymphedema diagnosis and that while it “does [not] \nimpact my ability to work ,” the diagnosis “ requires that I receive weekly treatment.” ( ECF 95 -7, \nDeBlasio Cert. Ex. Z.) Further, Charlie Creighton testified that he “probably” spoke to Ambrose about the November 24, 2019 email chain  with the subject line “Pay” (DeBlasio Cert. Ex. AA) . \n(ECF 97 -12, Blackburn Cert . Ex. L, C. Creighton Dep. Tr., at 60:11- 20.) But although Charlie \nCreighton and Ambrose may have been in touch about Plaintiff’s complaints —made the day \nbefore Colony Tire terminated him —Ambrose testified that she did not assist Charlie Creighton \nin drafting Plaintiff’s Termination Letter. ( ECF 97 -14, Blackburn Cert . Ex. N, Ambrose Dep. Tr., \nat 79:13- 15.) Finally, Charlie Creighton testified that he, Andrew Bergeron, and Scott Creighton \nmade the decision to terminate Plaintiff , a decision made days after Plaintiff informed them that \nhe needed treatment for lymphedema . (ECF 97 -12, Blackburn Cert . Ex. L, C. Creighton Dep. Tr. \nat 39:14- 16.)  \nBased on this evidence, the Court concludes that the facts are contested as to the \nCreightons ’ notice of and involvement in Plaintiff’s request for accommodations and whether they Case 2:20-cv-12364-JKS-JBC     Document 116     Filed 09/30/25     Page 26 of 27 PageID:\n<pageID>27 aided and abetted in denying Plaintiff reasonable  accommodations, should a factfinder find that \nColony Tire is liable.  Therefore,  Defendant s’ and Plaintiff’s motions for summary j udgment as to \nCount Five  are DENIED. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, Defendant’s  motion for summary j udgment ( ECF 95) is \nGRANTED in part  and DENIED in part.  Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment (ECF 96) is \nDENIED. An appropriate order follows.  \n/s/ Jamel K. Semper           . \nHON. JAMEL K.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The case involves pro se plaintiff John R. Fouts and his minor child, who are challenging several statutory and constitutional violations by Kentucky and federal agencies over issues such as missed social security checks, hazardous living conditions, and Child Protective Services investigations. The Northern District of California court determined that venue is improper since all involved parties and events are based in Kentucky, and thus, the case was transferred to the Western District of Kentucky. An unusual aspect of this case is Fouts's notification of using artificial intelligence in the drafting of his documents, though this did not impact the court’s decision.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the Northern District of California is the proper venue for the case, given the location of the parties and the events leading to the claims.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that venue is improper in the Northern District of California and transferred the case to the Western District of Kentucky, which is the appropriate jurisdiction based on the residence of the parties and location of relevant events.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: The court said, \"Hey, you can't bring this complaint here because all the people and events related to your case are over in Kentucky, not California.\" So, they decided to move the case to Kentucky, where it belongs, so it can be handled properly there. By the way, even though the person used a computer to help write their legal documents, that didn't change where the court thought the case should be.",

Nos. 1 , 4 \n \n \n \nBefore the Court are pro se  Plaintiff John R. Fouts  and his minor child ’s complaint , motion \nfor preliminary injunction, permanent restraining order, and permanent protective order  \n(“Motion”) , and several other filings and requests .1  ECF 1, 4.  Fouts  and his child are residents of \nKentucky who suffer from multiple medical conditions.  ECF 4  at 3.  Fouts alleges dozens of \nstatutory and constitutional violations against myriad Kentucky and federal agencies apparently \narising from, among other things, alleged failure to receive social security checks and prescription \ndrugs by mail, exposure to mold and other hazardous conditions in Fouts’s dwelling and \nsubsequent inability to obtain adequate medical care, as well as being subje ct to an improper Child \nProtective Services investigation, all in Kentucky.  See id.  at 8-35.  Having read Fouts’s papers \nand carefully considered the arguments therein, as well as the relevant legal authority, the Court \nhereby TRANSFERS  this action to the Western District of Kentucky pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1406, or alternatively, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a),  for the following reasons.   \n \n1 Since initiating this lawsuit, Fouts has filed a series of additional documents, including a \n“Motion to Compel Compliance with ADA Accommodations,” ECF 14, “Ophthalmological \nRecords Highlighting Critical Unmet Medical Needs,” ECF 16,  “HUD Correspondence \nHighlighting Systemic Failures, Discrimination, ADA Violations, and Neglect,” ECF 17 , and \n“Notification of Use of Artificial Intelligence in Document Drafting,” ECF 19, among others .  \nBecause the Court finds it appropriate to transfer the case, it does not address these filings.   Case 3:25-cv-00033-BJB-RSE     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 1 of 4 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  On December 23, 2024, the Court issued an order to show cause why the complaint should \nnot be dismissed or transferred for improper venue, as no party or event described in Fouts’s \npapers had any apparent connection to the Northern District of California.  ECF 12.  Venue is \nproper in a judicial district in which (1) any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the \nstate in which the district is located; (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred, or a su bstantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or \n(3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, \nany judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court’s persona l jurisdiction with \nrespect to such action.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  Similarly, w here a defendant is an agency of the \nUnited States, venue is proper “in any judicial district in which (A) a defendant in the action \nresides, (B) a substantial part of the event s or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a \nsubstantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or (C) the plaintiff resides if \nno real property is involved in the action. ”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).   \nA district court, in its discretion, “shall dismiss , or if it be in the interest of justice, \ntransfer ” an action under 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a) if venue is improper.  See King v. Russell , 963 F.2d \n1301, 1304 (9th Cir. 1992).  Courts may sua sponte  raise improper venue if, as here, the defendant \nhas not filed a responsive pleading and the parties are provided with an opportunity to respond to \nthe issue.  Costlow v. Weeks , 790 F.2d 1486, 1488 (9th Cir. 1986).  Even where venue is proper \nunder § 1391, a district court may transfer the case to another district for the convenience of the \nparties and witnesses.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) (“For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in \nthe interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division \nwhere it might have been brought.”).  The purpose of such transfer  is to “prevent the waste of \n‘time, energy and money’ and to ‘protect litigants, witnesses, and the public against unnecessary \ninconvenience and expense.’ ”  Van Dusen v. Barrack , 376 U.S. 612 (1964).  Courts may  also \ntransfer cases under § 1404(a) sua sponte . \n// \n// \n// Case 3:25-cv-00033-BJB-RSE     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 2 of 4 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Venue is not proper in this District.  Fouts and his child reside in Louisville,  Kentucky, as \ndo many  Defendants.2  Moreover, as far as the Court can discern from Fouts’s submissions , all \nrelevant events and omissions occurred in Kentucky.   See, e.g. , ECF 4 at 14 ( stating  that Fouts  and \nhis child suffered significant harm due to hazardous living conditions at an apartment with a \nLouisville, Kentucky address); id. at 22 -25 (describing  inadequate care by medical care providers \nat Baptist Health Louisville and University of Louisville).   In his response to the Court’s Order , \nFouts  does not assert that any Plaintiff or Kentucky agency  or individual establishes proper venue \nin this District , nor does he state that  any events or omissions occurred in this District.  To the  \nextent  Fouts sugg ests that venue is proper here because some Defendants are federal agencies , that \nis not so .  “Venue does not lie in every judicial district where a federal agency has a regional \noffice,” Williams v. United States , No. C -01-0024 EDL, 2001 WL 1352885, at *1 (N.D. Cal. Oct. \n23, 2001)  (citing Reuben H. Donnelly Corp. v. Federal Trade Comm ’n, 580 F.2d 264, 267 (7th \nCir. 1978)), and c ourts in the Ninth Circuit  have often found that  federal agencies are deemed \nresidents of the District of Columbia, regardless of where any regional offices may be located .  \nSee, e.g. , Al Hada v. Pompeo , Case No. CV 18 -8002 -DMG (JPRx ), 2018 WL 6264999, at *2 \n(C.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2018) (denying motion for preliminary injunction where venue was improper \nagainst  federal agency defendants); Tsi Akim Maidu of Taylorsville Rancheria v. United States \nDep’t of Interior , Case No. 16 -cv-07189 -LB, 2017 WL 2289203, at *2 (N.D. Cal. May 25, 2017) \n(explaining  that “[g]enerally, all federal defendants reside in Washington, D.C.,” and “[v]enue \ndoes not lie in every judicial district where a federal agency has a regional office”  (citations and \ninternal  quotation marks omitted) ).  While Fouts states that “[n]ationwide programs are directly \nimplicated, and their administration in California is relevant to this case,” ECF 15 at 1, Fouts’s  \nsubmissions do  not allege  any such relevance, and the Court cannot discern any.  Fouts reiterates \nthe urgency of his situation and past experiences of discrimination in Kentucky, but such factors  \n \n2 Fouts filed a 22 -page exhibit to his Motion listing dozens of Defendants.  ECF 1 5-4.  While the \nresidence of each Defendant is not expressly alleged in Fouts’s complaint or otherwise listed in \nFouts’s submissions, Fouts lists Louisville, Kentucky addresses for many Defendants.  See id. at \n19-20.  Indeed, every address listed for a Defendant is an address outside of California, and as to \nthose Defendants for whom no address is listed, there is no discernable connection to California.      \n Case 3:25-cv-00033-BJB-RSE     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 3 of 4 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  do not establish proper venue here.  Plaintiffs and many Defendants reside in Louisville, \nKentucky , which is also where the relevant events occurred.  Because no party resides in this \nDistrict, and because the events giving rise to Fouts’s claims did not occur here, t he Court thus \ndetermines that under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, venue is not  proper .   \nThe Court must next determine i f it would be in the interest of justice to transfer the case .  \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).   “[T]ransfer will generally be in the interest of justice .”  Amity \nRubberized Pen Co. v. Mkt. Quest Grp. Inc. , 793 F.3d 991, 996 (9th Cir. 2015) (internal quotations \nomitted) (noting the Ninth Circuit has “rarely found that transfer would not serve the interests of \njustice,” and that the determination of whether transfer is in the interest of justice is “a low bar” \nthat “will usually involve a very limited inquiry by the transferring court” ).  The Court concludes \nfrom its limited inquiry that transfer is in the interest of justice so that  Fouts ’s case  may be \nscreened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915 .  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a), the Court \nTRANSFERS  this action to the Western  District of Kentucky , the proper venue for Loui sville, \nKentucky .  Even if venue were proper in this District, because most parties reside in the Western \nDistrict of Kentucky  and the events at issue occurred there, it is clear that the Western  District of \nKentucky is a more convenient forum  under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) .    \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  January 1 5, 2025   \n \n  \nARACELI MARTÍNEZ -OLGUÍN  \nUnited States District Judge  \nCase 3:25-cv-00033-BJB-RSE     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 4 of 4 PageID #:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Eliza Taylor filed a class action lawsuit against ConverseNow Technologies, Inc. for allegedly violating the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) by using AI technology to intercept and record phone conversations without consent. ConverseNow is accused of processing phone orders via AI assistants in restaurants and using these conversations to improve its AI software, without notifying customers. The court denied ConverseNow’s motion to dismiss, determining that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged violations of CIPA.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether ConverseNow's use of AI to intercept and record customer phone calls without obtaining consent violates California Penal Code Sections 631 and 632, pertaining to unauthorized wiretapping and recording of confidential communications.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Taylor's allegations are sufficient to claim that ConverseNow intercepted communications without consent and considered it a third party under the capability approach since it uses these communications for its own software enhancement. Therefore, the motion to dismiss was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you call a pizza place to order a pizza and give them your credit card details, thinking you're just talking to the pizza shop. But actually, a company using a smart computer program is secretly listening in to help the pizza place handle calls. The customer wasn’t told about this, and the company was using the calls to make their computer program smarter. The judge said the company might have broken privacy rules by not telling people they were listening and recording these calls, so they're going to continue looking into this.",

No. 21  \n \n \nDefendant ConverseNow Technologies, Inc. has moved to dismiss plaintiff Eliza Taylor’s \nclass action  complaint.  Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7 -1(b), the Court found this matter appropriate \nfor resolution without oral argument and vacated the hearing.  For the reasons set forth below, the \nCourt DENIES defendant’s motion . \n \nBACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff brings a putative class action against ConverseNow  for violating the California \nInvasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), Cal ifornia  Penal Code sections  631 and 632.  ConverseNow \nprovides a “software as a service” that allows restaurants to process customer phone calls using an \nartificial intelligence virtual assistant.  Dkt. No. 1 (“Compl.”) ¶¶  9, 18 -21.  ConverseNow operates \nacross more than a thousand stores in 43 states and  “processes millions of live conversations each \nmonth.”  Id. ¶¶ 9, 19. \nConverseNow ’s website  states that the “voice AI assistants automatically answer every call \nthat comes in and accurately records guest orders in real -time,” then send those orders to the \nrestaurant for preparation .  Id. ¶¶ 21,  29.  Live agents may listen in on the calls to “put the finishing Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 1 of 13 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  touches on complex orders when necessary” and to help the AI system learn how to handle similar \nfuture orders.  Id. ¶ 22.    \nBeyond providing benefits for its customers, plaintiff  alleges that ConverseNow itself \nbenefits from  the calls because, per ConverseNow ’s website, “by processing millions of live \nconversations each month, our self -learning system evolves even faster every day to improve the \nguest experience for new and existing partners alike.”  Id. ¶ 24.  Plaintiff  alleges that ConverseNow’s  \ncontinued sales and marketing success relies on this ability to improve its software.   Id. ¶¶ 27-28.  \nMoreover, the company’s privacy policy  states that  it uses the information to “improv[e] our \nordering platform, advertisements, products, and services.”  Id. ¶ 44. \nOne of ConverseNow’s partners is the pizza chain Domino’s.  Id. ¶ 32.  ConverseNow has \ntechnology “custom -tailored for Domino’s with quick and easy setup” that integrates directly with \nDomino’s data software and phone system .  Id. ¶¶ 32-33.  Plaintiff Taylor, an Oakland, California \nresident,  placed a delivery order at the Domino’s located in Delano, California, a location employing \nConverseNow’s voice AI technology.  Id. ¶ 6.  When Taylor called, an automated voice answered \nsaying , “Thank you for calling Domino’s. How can I help you today?”  Id.  Taylor placed her order \nand provided her name, address, and credit card information.  Id. ¶¶ 6 -7.  Taylor believed that \nDomino’s was the only other party on the call when she provided her “personal and confidential \ninformation.”  Id. ¶ 7.  Taylor did not know the call “was being intercepted in real time and \nwiretapped by Defendant  ConverseNow .”  Id. ¶ 6.  \nPlaintiff  alleges that w hen calling a store that uses ConverseNow’s technology, defendant \n“intercepts and redirects the call to its servers for recording.”  Id. ¶ 35.  “Within seconds, a virtual \nassistant introduces themselves using their ‘name’ stating they are an employee of the store location \nthe customer is calling and asks the customer what they would like to order today .”  Id. ¶ 36.  \nDefendant’s virtual assistant confirms the order and delivery address then takes the customer’s \npayment information.   Id. ¶¶ 36 -37.   \nTaylor alleges that t he caller is not informed that ConverseNow is a party to the call.  Id. \n¶ 38.  Restaurants  like Domino’s “fail to pursue or obtain prior consent, express or otherwise , from  \ncallers prior to  allowing Defendant  to record, examine, intercept, collect, and analyze the content of Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 2 of 13 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  customers’ conversations.”  Id. ¶ 41.  ConverseNow’s Terms and Conditions for restaurants \n“provides that the [restaurants] ‘may not represent or imply to others that [their] Customer Data is \nin any way provided, sponsored, or endorsed by ConverseNow.’”  Id. ¶ 42.  ConverseNow defines \n“Customer Data” as “any and all information and content that a user submits to, or uses with, the \nPlatform . . . .”  Id.   \nTaylor alleges that “[i]n sum, ConverseNow has the capability to use caller communications \nto (i) improve its own products and services; (ii) develop new ConverseNow products and services; \nand (iii) analyze customers’ communications to assist with avoiding the intervention of res taurant \nstaff in the order process.”  Id. ¶ 31.   \nPlaintiff filed this action on January 30, 2025.  See Compl.   ConverseNow filed a motion to \ndismiss pursuant to Fed eral Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6)  on March 24, 2025.  Dkt. No. 21  \n(“Mot.”) .  The Court granted multiple stipulations for an extended briefing schedule.  Dkt. Nos. 17, \n30, 32.  Plaintiff opposed the motion on April 23, 2025, Dkt. No. 28  (“Opp’n”) , and defendant \nreplied on May 16, 2025 , Dkt. No. 33.  \n \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint if \nit fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss, the plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim  to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  This “facial plausibility” standard requires \nthe plaintiff to allege facts that add up to “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfull y.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678  (2009).  While courts do not require “heightened \nfact pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555, 570.     \n In deciding whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, the \ncourt must assume that the plaintiff’s allegations are true and must draw all reasonable inferences \nin the plaintiff’s favor.  See Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987).  \nHowever, the court is not required to accept as true “allegations that are merely conclusory, Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 3 of 13 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d \n1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008).  \n If the Court dismisses the complaint, it must then decide whether to grant leave to amend. \nThe Ninth Circuit has “repeatedly held that a district court should grant leave to amend even if no \nrequest to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines tha t the pleading could not possibly \nbe cured by the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   \n \nDISCUSSION  \nI. Section 631  \n California Penal Code section 631 creates four alternative avenues of liability for any person  \n[1] who, by means of any machine, instrument, or contrivance, or in \nany other manner, intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized \nconnection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, \ninductively, or otherwise, with any telegraph or telephone wire, lin e, \ncable, or instrument, including the wire, line, cable, or instrument of \nany internal telephonic communication system, or  \n[2] who willfully and without the consent of all parties to the \ncommunication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to \nread, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report, or \ncommunication while the same is in transit or passing over any wire, \nline, or cable, or is being sent from, or received at any place within \nthis state; or  \n[3] who uses, or attempts to use, in any manner, or for any purpose, \nor to communicate in any way, any information so obtained, or  \n[4] who aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or \npersons to unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any of the \nacts or things mentioned above in this section  . . . . \nCal. Pen. Code § 631(a) (subdivisions added for clarity); Javier v. Assurance IQ, LLC , 649 F. Supp. \n3d 891, 897 (N.D. Cal. 2023).   The third clause  requires proving a violation of the first or second \nclauses .   See In re Google Assistant Priv. Litig. , 457 F. Supp. 3d 797, 827 (N.D. Cal. 2020) .  \nOtherwise,  these clauses are independent bases for liability  and a section 631 claim survives if a \nplaintiff plausibly alleges a defendant committed any of the prohibited actions.   Here, plaintiff \nalleges violations of the first three clauses  of the statute.  Compl. ¶¶ 57 -72. Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 4 of 13 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   The parties dispute whether defendant  is a third party  subject to  the law  or a party to the \nconversation exempt from the law ; whether defendant  receives an independent benefit from its use \nof data; whether defendant  acted with the requisite intent; and whether defendant  “intercepted” \ncommunications in “real -time.”  See Mot. at 13 -19; Opp’n at 2 -10.  The Court considers each \nargument in turn.  \n \nA.       Third  Party Status and Use of Data  \nThe parties dispute whether defendant is a third party to the conversation between Domino’s \nand its customers because California exempts parties to a conversation from liability under section \n631.  Two California court opinions are widely cited to explain this distinction.  In Rogers v. Ulrich , \nthe defendant  recorded his conversation with the plaintiff  using a tape recorder jack, then later \nplayed the recording  for other individuals.   125 Cal. Rptr. 306, 307 (Ct. App. 1975) .  The court held \nthat the plainti ff could  not make a case under the statute because “[i]t is never a secret to one party \nto a conversation that the other party is listening to the conversation; only a third party can listen \nsecretly to a private conversation.”  Id. at 309.  In Ribas v. Clark , the defendant  surreptitiously  \nlistened to a telephone conversation between the plaintiff  and the plaintiff’s ex -wife at the ex-wife’s \nrequest.  696 P.2d 637, 639 ( Cal. 1985) .  The court held that the complaint established a prima facie \nviolation because the defendant  eavesdropped on the conversation and “a substantial distinction has \nbeen recognized between the secondhand repetition of the contents of a conversation and its \nsimultaneous dissemination to an unannounced second auditor, whether that auditor be a person o r \nmechanical device.”  Id. at 640 (citation omitted ). Thus, in considering claims under section  631, \ncourts must decide whether or not the defendant is a party to the conversation.  \nThe parties  recognize that courts have  split on approaching the third -party issue  between \nanalyzing whether a defendant is an “extension” of a third party or has the “capability” of using the \ncommunications for an independent  purpose .1  Opp’n at 2 ; Mot. at 14 .  The paradigm “extension” \ncase is  Graham v. Noom , Inc. et al. , where a co-defendant software company , FullStory, provided \n \n1 A third group of opinions focuses on whether the defendant service provider is simply a \nseparate legal entity.  See, e.g., Saleh v. Nike, Inc. , 562 F. Supp. 3d 503, 520 (C.D. Cal. 2021).  The \nCourt finds this approach less helpful.  Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 5 of 13 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Noom a “session replay” tool allowing Noom  to play back a recording of the plaintiffs’  “keystrokes, \nmouse clicks, and page scrolling”  when visiting Noom’s website.   533 F. Supp. 3d 823, 828 (N.D. \nCal. 2021).  The court held that FullStory was Noom’s extension —not a third party —because it is \na “vendor that provides a software service that captures its clients’ data, hosts it on FullStory’s \nservers, and allows the client to analyze their data . . . [and that] there are no allegations here that \nFullStory intercepted and used the da ta itself.”  Id. at 832.  The court considered FullStory’s tool to \nbe like the tape recorder used by the defendant in Rogers .  Id.  Citing Graham , defendant  here \ncontends that it is not a “third party,” but rather it is Domino’s “extension ” because it acts as a tool \nfor Domino’s business purposes.  Mot. at 13 -15.   \nThe capability approach is championed i n Javier  v. Assurance IQ, LLC , where the court \nfound that similar session replay software violated section 631 because the software provider had \nthe capability of using its recording for another purpose .  649 F. Supp. 3d 891, 900 (N.D. Cal. 2023) .  \nThe court rejected the extension approach because that approach interprets the statute’s second \nclause  “based on the intentions and usage of the prospective third party,” but that  “swallows the \nthird prong” that penalizes th e information’s usage.  Id.  The court further clarified  that “[t]he Ribas  \nCourt did not consider the wife’s friend’s intentions or the use to which they put the information \nthey obtained.”  Id.  The Ribas  Court instead “emphasized the privacy concerns at issue with having \nan ‘unannounced second auditor’ listening in on the call . . . .”  Id. (quoting Ribas , 696 P.2d  at 640 ).  \n“[A] growing number of district courts” have since agreed with this capability approach.  See Turner \nv. Nuance Commc ’ns, Inc. , 735 F. Supp. 3d 1169, 1184 (N.D. Cal. 2024) . \nThis Court agrees with the capability approach and finds sufficient allegations in the \ncomplaint to consider defendant a third party  under that approach.  Defendant’s website and privacy \npolicy explain that defendant uses information from the millions of calls it processes to “improv[e] \n[its] ordering platform, advertisements, products, and services.”  Id. ¶¶ 24, 27 -28, 44.  Defendant’s  \nVoice AI learns from each interaction and “continuously refines the underlying algorithms.”  Id. \n¶ 25.  Live agents working behind the scenes sometimes aid in this process.  Id. ¶¶ 22 -23.  Thus, \nunlike the plaintiff s in Graham , plaintiff here alleges that defendant provides a software service to \nits customers, and also uses the information collected to improve its own product .  See Graham , 533 Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 6 of 13 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  F. Supp. 3d at 832.  The software’s capabilities  thus go “beyond the ordinary function of a tape \nrecorder.”  Javier , 649 F. Supp. 3d at 900 (quoting Yoon v. Lululemon , 549 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 1081 \n(C.D. Cal. 2021)).  \nIn a more factually analogous case  than Graham , a court reached the same conclusion.  \nThere, a  plaintiff customer called  Capital One’s Customer Support Center and discussed the \nplaintiff’s banking information.  Gladstone v. Amazon Web Services, Inc. , 739 F. Supp. 3d 846, 850 \n(W.D. Wash. 2024).  Capital One used Amazon Connect, a service that “record[s] and analyze[s] \ncallers’ voice and conversations” before providing the data to its customers like Capital One.  Id. at \n849.  The plaintiff alleged that Amazon  Connect can use the information to improve its own services, \nquoting its Service Terms that said it can use the content of the communications for “ development \nand improvement of Amazon Connect ML Services ” and “ to develop and improve AWS and \naffiliate machine -learning and artificial intelligence technologies . . . .”  Id. at 849 -50.  The court \nheld that the plaintiff’s allegations were sufficient because they “demonstrate that [Amazon \nConnect] has capabilities beyond that of a mere tape recorder, and there is no evidence that [Amazon \nConnect] is incapable of using the dat a for any other purpose.”  Id. at 855.   \n Similarly, i n Yockey v. Salesforce, Inc. , the court held that the defendant’s chat software \nrendered it a third party to communications between customers and companies using the software, \nbecause the plaintiff had amended the complaint to add allegations detailing how the defendant  used \nthe communications to train its AI models and improve or develop its own products.  745 F. Supp. \n3d 945, 951 (N.D. Cal. 2024)  (Yockey II ).2  Other courts have recently reached similar conclusions.  \nSee Turner , 735 F. Supp. 3d at 1185  (holding that defendant’s use of AI voice recognition software \nto create a biometric voice print of a caller may use voice prints to improve its own product ); Tate \nv. VITAS Healthcare Corp. , 762 F. Supp. 3d 949, 95 6-57 (E.D. Cal. 2025)  (holding that software \nthat listens to a call and produces data about the call’s purpose and resolution could be used to \nimprove the product).  \n \n2 In an earlier order, the court had adopted the capability approach, but found the allegations \nin the operative complaint insufficient to establish “the capability to use these communications for \nany other purpose than furnishing them to Kaiser ,” a party to the chat.   Yockey v. Salesforce, Inc. , \n688 F. Supp. 3d 962, 973 (N.D. Cal. 2023)  (Yockey I ). Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 7 of 13 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Beyond Graham , defendant cites several other cases in support of its argument that it is not \na third party, but these cases are inapposite.  Mot. at 13 -14 (citing Jones v. Tonal Sys. , No. 3:23 -cv-\n1267 -JES-BGS, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178056, at *18 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2024) ; Cody v. Boscov’s , \n658 F. Supp. 3d 779, 782 (C.D. Cal. 2023) ; Byars v. Hot Topic, Inc. , 656 F. Supp. 3d 1051, 1066 -\n68 (C.D. Cal. 2023) ; Licea v. Am. Eagle Outfitters, Inc. , 659 F. Supp. 3d 1072, 1082 (C.D. Cal. \n2023) ).  Each case involve d the use of online chat software, but the courts found that plaintiffs had \nnot alleged that the software provider used the data from chats for any purpose other than to benefit \nits clients.  In another case, the allegations that a chat software owner harvested chat transcripts were \ntoo “generalized and vague” to support liability under the capability approach.  Cody v. Ring LLC , \n718 F. Supp. 3d 993, 1002 (N.D. Cal. 2024) ; see also  Williams v. What If Holdings, LLC , No. C 22 -\n03780 WHA, 2022 WL 17869275, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 22, 2022)  (holding a defendant not liable \nwhere there were no allegations that a software provider “a ffirmatively engages with that data in \nany way other than to store it ”).  By contrast, plaintiff here clearly alleges how ConverseNow uses \ncustomer phone calls to improve its AI product  and expand its business.  \n In sum, the Court adopts the capability approach and considers defendant to be a third party \nto the conversation between plaintiff and Domino’s  because it may use details from that \nconversation for its own purpose.3 \n \nB. Interception  \nThe second clause of section 631 requires that the defendant intercepts a communication \nwhen it is “in transit.”  Cal. Pen. Code § 631(a).  Defendant  contends that plaintiff  “must plead \nspecific facts explaining how the software works or how the interception actually occurs.”  Mot. at  \n16.  Defendant further argues that plaintiff’s allegations suggest it cannot intercept the \n \n3 The Court offers one note of clarification regarding the different clauses  of section 631.  \nUnder the capability approach, a party may be liable as a third party under the first or second clause  \nof section 631 —wiretapping or intercepting communications in transit without consent —if it has \nthe capability  to use the information it learns for an outside purpose.  A party is liable under the \nthird clause  if it violates one of the first two prongs and then actually  uses the information received \n“in any manner, or for any purpose.”   Cal. Pen. Code § 631(a);  Turner , 735 F. Supp. 3d at 1186 .   Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 8 of 13 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  communication because Domino’s routes the phone call to its servers, making it a party  to the \nconversation .  Id. at 17.  Neither argument persuades the Court that the complaint fails on this point.  \n To determine whether an interception has occurred, courts sometimes look at “cases \nanalyzing the Wiretap Act as informative of section 631(a).”  Licea , 659 F. Supp. 3d at 1084.  The \nNinth Circuit analyzed the Wiretap Act to determine that interception “with respect to wire \ncommunications” is “acquisition contemporaneous with transmission.”  Konop v. Hawaiian \nAirlines, Inc. , 302 F.3d 868, 878 (9th Cir. 2002).  \n Here, plaintiff ’s allegations establish how defendant  intercepts communications  in real -time.   \nPlaintiff believed she was calling Domino’s and an automated voice answered by saying “Thank \nyou for calling Domino’s.”  Compl. ¶ 6.  Plaintiff continued to believe Domino’s remained the other \nparty on the line, even when the call had been routed to defendant ’s AI voice assistants.  Id. ¶ 7-8.  \nWhen a customer states she wants to place an order, defendant’s AI assistant introduces themselves \n“within seconds.”  Id. ¶¶ 35 -36.  These allegations are sufficient to state a claim that defendant \nintercepts communications without consent in real time.  And defendant’s argument that it is a party \nto the conversation because the callers do not reach Domino’s is unavailing.  According to the \ncomplaint, the customers call Domino’s and think they are talking with Domino’s when the call has \nin fact been redirected by defendant.  \n Defendant’s cited case law does not convince the Court otherwise.  See Mot. at 16.  Many \nof the cases involve online chat communications , which present factually distinct circumstances.  \nSee Cody v. Lacoste , No. 8:23 -cv-00235 -SSS-DTBx, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135843, at *5 (C.D. \nCal. July 30, 2024) ; Ring LLC , 718 F. Supp. 3d at 1001; Esparza v. Gen. Digit. Inc. , No. cv23 -8223 -\nKK-AGRx, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28132, at *10 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 16, 2024) ; Swarts v. Home Depot , \nInc., 689 F. Supp. 3d 732, 746 (N.D. Cal . 2023) ; Valenzuela v. Keurig Green Mt., Inc. , 674 F. Supp. \n3d 751, 759 (C.D. Cal. 2023) .  Whether a third party pulls online chat communications into its own \nservers in real time is a different question than whether a voice AI software intercepts a phone \nconversation and directly engages with the caller.  \n In short, plaintiff has pled a plausible claim of interception in real time.  \n Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 9 of 13 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  C. Intention  \nSeparately, d efendant  contends that plaintiff ’s allegations are deficient and conclusory \nregarding defendant ’s intent to tap into or intercept communications.  Mot. at 19.  The first clause  \nof the statute requires a person to act “intentionally,” while the second clause  requires a person to \nact “willfully.”  Cal. Pen. Code § 631(a).  Under the federal Electronic Communications Privacy \nAct (ECPA), to act intentionally is to act “ purposefully and deliberately and not as a result of \naccident or mistake .”  United States v. Christensen , 828 F.3d 763, 774 (9th Cir. 2015).  “Intent under \nCIPA is determined consistently with intent under ECPA  . . . .”  Doe v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , 690 \nF. Supp. 3d 1064, 1079 (N.D. Cal. 2023) . \nPlaintiff argues that intent is not a required element, but plaintiff conflates the third -party \ncapability inquiry with the underlying illegal actions in the statute.  Plaintiff is correct that to prove \na defendant is a third party to a conversation —and therefore not exempted from coverage under \nRogers —a plaintiff need only show the capability to put the information to independent use, not an \nintent to do so.  But once a defendant is established as a third party, plaintiff must show that \ndefendant intended to intercept plaintiff’s communications, in this case her phone call to Domino’s.  \nContrary to defendant’s understanding of the complaint, plaintiff’s allegations plausibl y \nplead that ConverseNow intentionally intercepted and learned the contents of plaintiff’s phone order \nto Domino’s.  Plaintiff alleges that “[b]y virtue of its business, Defendant intended to wiretap \nPlaintiff and members of the Classes by contracting with businesses such as Domino’s to use its \ntechnology.”  Compl. ¶ 71.  ConverseNow “custom -tailored” its technology specifically for \nDomino’s existing software and phone systems.  Id. ¶ 32.  These allegations are sufficient to show \nthat defendant did not stumb le into recording the conversations by “ accident or mistake .”  See \nChristensen , 828 F.3d at 774; see also  Gladstone , 739 F. Supp. 3d  at 860 (holding the complaint \nsufficiently pled intent where the software in question “is designed for the purpose of recording and \nanalyzing communications between its customers (like Capital One) and consumers or other \nentities ”).   \n Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 10 of 13 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  D. Section 631 Liability Conclusion  \nDefendant’s collective arguments that plaintiff has failed to state a claim under section 631 \nmiss the mark.  The complaint plausibly alleges that defendant’s voice AI software violates at least \nthe second  clause of section 631.   The Court thus DENIES defendant’s motion to dismiss plaintiff’s \nclaim under section 631.  \n \nII. Section 632  \nCalifornia Penal Code section  632 creates criminal liability for  \nA person who, intentionally and without the consent of all parties to \na confidential communication, uses an electronic amplifying or \nrecording device to eavesdrop upon or record the confidential \ncommunication, whether the communication is carried on among the \nparties in the presence of one another or by means of a telegraph, \ntelephone, or other device, except a radio. . .  . \nCal. Penal Code § 632(a).   In relevant part, t he statute defines “confidential communication ” as  \nany communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably \nindicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined \nto the parties thereto, but exclud[ing]  a communication made . . . in \nany other circumstance in which the parties to the communication \nmay reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or \nrecorded.  \nId. § 632(c).   The California Supreme Court interpreted this language to mean “that a conversation \nis confidential under section 632 if a party to that conversation has an objectively reasonable \nexpectation that the conversation is not being overheard or recorded.”  Flanagan v. Flanagan , 41 \nP.3d 575, 576  (Cal. 2002) . \n Defendant  asserts that plaintiff had no objectively reasonable expectation that their phone \ncall to Domino’s would not be recorded.  Mot. at 19 -22.  Defendant flippantly suggests that “there \nis no privacy or confidentiality interest in pepperoni, sausage, or mushrooms.”  Id. at 22.  Defendant \nrelies on Swarts v. Home Depot , where the court found no expectation of confidentiality in an online \nchat with Home Depot representatives, distinguishing from a case involving a healthcare website \nand medical communications.  689 F. Supp. 3d at 747. \n Unsurprisingly, plaintiff focuses on the sharing of her name, address, and credit card \ninformation —not her pizza toppings.  Opp’n at 12.  Plaintiff draws support from Smith v. YETI Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 11 of 13 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Coolers, LLC , 754 F. Supp. 3d 933, 939 (N.D. Cal. 2024) , where a third party payment processor \ntook customers’ personal information and financial information and used it in a fraud prevention \ntool.  There, the court remarked that the confidentiality question is a “fact -intensive inquiry that is \noften too diffi cult to resolve at the pleadings stage.”  Id. at 943 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  The court concluded that “[P]laintiff has plausibly alleged that the sensitive financial \ninformati on being recorded is the type that could be reasonably considered confidential.”  Id.  In \nanother case, the plaintiff alleged that he shared credit card information with customer service \nrepresentatives over the phone without being told that the conversation was being recorded.  Bales \nv. Sierra Trading Post, Inc. , No. 13CV1894 JM KSC, 2013 WL 6244529, at *1 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 3, \n2013) .  The court there likewise concluded that disclosing “ personal financial information is \nsufficient to establish a confidential communication for purposes of § 632. ”  Id. at *3.    \n A review of the first amended complaint in Swarts indicates that this case falls closer to \nSmith  and Bales  than Swarts .  The content of the communications between plaintiff Swarts and \nHome Depot involved “ inquiries related to home improvement products he had purchased, whether \nthose products could be exchanged, and pending orders for products which were available for sale \non Defendant’s website .”  Swarts v. Home Depot , Case No. 4:23-cv-00995 -JST (N.D. Cal.), Dkt. \nNo. 17 (First Amended Complaint) ¶ 17.  Nowhere in the complaint did plaintiff allege sharing \npersonal financial information.  \n The Court agrees with the opinions in Smith and Bales  that alleging the sharing of personally \nidentifiable information and personal financial information is sufficient to allege a confidential \ncommunication took place, at least at the pleading stage.  The Court therefore DENIES defendant’s \nmotion to dismiss plaintiff’s claim under section 632.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons and for good cause shown, the Court hereby DENIES  defendant ’s \nmotion to dismiss.    \nThe Court re -sets the initial management conference to August 29, 2025, at 2:30 p.m.,  to \n/// Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 12 of 13 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  be held over Zoom videoconference.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Shift4 Payments, LLC and its founder Jared Isaacman suing Cloudflare, and unnamed individuals and corporations, for hosting websites that allegedly contain false information about a fictitious lawsuit involving Shift4. These websites, employing AI-generated content, fabricate litigation documents and attribute false statements to Isaacman. The court denied the preliminary injunction, ruling that Isaacman's name does not qualify as a protected mark under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA).\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Jared Isaacman's personal name can be considered a protected mark under the ACPA, allowing for a claim of cybersquatting against domains using his name.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Isaacman's personal name does not qualify as a protected mark under the ACPA, as the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate it has acquired secondary meaning or fame as required by the statute, and thereby denied the motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Imagine someone makes a fake website about you, saying you did bad things, and they use your name in the website link. You want them to stop, but the rules say your name must be super famous, like a trademark, to win. The court said your name isn’t famous enough for these rules, so they won't force the website to stop.",

ECF No. 1 .  The complaint alleges claims for cybersquatting, defamation, \nfalse light and business disparagement .  Id.   \nPlaintiffs  now move for a preliminary injunction under the Anticybersquatting and \nConsumer Protection Act  (“ACPA”) , 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d).  ECF No. 16.   For the reasons that \nfollow, the court will deny the motion.   \nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Factual Background\nPlaintiff Shift4 is  a publicly traded payment processing company .   ECF No. 16 -1 ¶1.  Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 1 of 9 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiff Jared Isaacman is the founder, chairman and former CEO of Shift4.  ECF No. 16 -1 ¶4.  \nIsaacman is a public figure known for  his activities as an astronaut , pilot , and for being considered \nby the United  States  Senate to  serve as the administrator of National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration .  ECF No. 16 -1  \nIn recent months, Plaintiffs have identified three websites containing information about \nlitigation in which Shift4 is purportedly, but not actually, involved :  \nJaredIsaacmanCourtCase.com, AIGeneratedBooks.com, and TheLuckyTrigger.com .  ECF No. 16 -\n2 ¶12.  Defendant Cloudflare. Inc. is the registrar for JaredIsaacmanCourtCase.com and  \nAIGeneratedBooks.com , ECF No. 16 -2 ¶16, ¶18, and Hostinge r is the registrar for \nTheLuckyTrigger.com , ECF No. 16 -2 ¶15.  All three websites  contain information about a \nfictitious  federal case, Card Connect, LLC v. Shift4 Payments, LLC , Case No. 2:23 -cv-00267 -\nJDW [Card Connect  case] , allegedly filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.   ECF No. 16 -2 \n¶9, ¶12.  The cited case number actually pertains to an existing but wholly different litigation  \ninvolving different parties and facts.  ECF No. 16 -2 ¶12.   \nThe domain for the first website, JaredIsaacmanCourtCase.com  (“Isaacman Website ”), was \nanonymously registered on or about June 14, 2025 utilizing Defendant Cloudflare, Inc. as the \nregistrar.  ECF No. 16 -2 ¶12, ¶18.  “The Isaacman Website links to 2,430 fabricated ‘exhibits ’ that \nall appear to have been generated by artificial intelligence. ”  ECF No. 16 -2 ¶13.  The Isaacman \nWebsite also lists 61 fabricated  quotes it attributes to  Mr. Isaacman , allegedly derived from the \nthousands of fake exhibits in the Card Connect case.  ECF No. 16-3 at 25 -30; ECF No. 16 -2 ¶13.  \nThe fabricated quotes attributed to  Mr. Isaacman includ ing admissions of illicit drug usage, \nsolicitation, criminal conduct, harassment of employees of Shift4, racial discrimination , financial \nissues at Shift4 .  ECF No. 16 -2 ¶15.   \nThe domain for the second website , The AIGeneratedBooks.com  [Books Website] , was \nanonymously registered on or about May 8, 2025 using  Cloudflare as its registrar .  ECF No. 16 -2 \n¶16.  The website purports to have discovered the existence of the Card Connect  case through the \nuse of an A rtificial Intelligence program .  Id.  The website markets a fictional book  titled The \nLucky Trigger  that was apparently  written  by an AI called “Rogue AI” based on the “real -world Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 2 of 93 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Shift4 case”  and offers a sample for download.  Id.  The sample is a  15,420 -page PDF containing  \nthe fabricated exhibits from  the Card Connect case.  Id.  The exhibits similarly contain  false and \ninaccurate statements attributed to Mr. Isaacman and other employees of Shift4 .  Id. \nThe domain for the third website,  TheLuckyTrigger.com  [Lucky Website ], was \nanonymously registered on or about May 23, 2025 using Hostinger as its registrar.  ECF No. 16 -2 \n¶17.  The website hosted on the domain markets The Lucky Trigger , describing the book  as a \n“pulse -pounding thriller .”  Id.  The website lists a cast of characters  featured in the book, of which \nMr. Isaacman  is one .  Id.  A link to download the  book leads to a link to  a 15,420 -page PDF \ncontaining fabricated exhibits  and descriptions of the Card Connect  Case .  Id.  \nUpon discovery of the Isaacman  Website and discovering that Defendant Cloudflare \nserved as the registrar for the website, Plaintiffs reported the false and defamatory content to \nCloudfla re on July 17, 2025  and demanded that the website be taken down .  ECF No. 16 -2 ¶19.  \nCloudflare  rejected Plaintiffs’ request,  stating that they were unable to “remove materials from the \nInternet hosted by other s,” and also because they “did not detect any violations f or the reported \nURL.”   Id.  When Plaintiffs requested on J uly 23, 2025 that Cloudflare  provide information \nregarding the identity of the registrant or owner of the website  and provided evidence that the \nCard Connect case the Isaacman W ebsite talked about was  false , Cloudflare rejected their \nrequest s.  ECF No. 16 -2 ¶20-22. \nIn the meantime, the information from the fictitious litigation websites continues to be \ncirculate on the intern et, being republished on websites such as “Dailymotion ,” “Scribd ,” \n“TheLayoff.com ,” and “financial -news.co.uk ,” sharing  information about the Card Connect  case \nand the exhibits  as though they were from  a real case .  ECF No. 16 -2 ¶25-26.  \nB. Procedural Background\nOn August 8, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a Complaint against the anonymous persons or \ncorporations  responsible for the registration and creation of the three websites  and Cloudflare  Inc., \nalleging violations of  Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d) .  The \ncomplaint also include s claims for defamation , false light, and business disparagement /trade libel.  \nECF No. 1.  On August 22, 2025, Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order  and order for Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 3 of 9 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  expedited discovery against defendant Cloudflare and third -party Hostinger.  ECF No. 10.  On \nAugust  27, 2025, the Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order relating \nto the Isaacman  Website  domain name.  ECF No.  15.  The order also required Defendants to show \ncause as to why a preliminary injunction should not be issued  and permitted limited  discovery \nfrom Defendant Cloudflare and third -party Hostinger to identify the owner (s) of the websites .  Id.  \nPlaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction on  September 1, 2025  to enjoin Defendants \nfrom operating, using or transferring to a different registrar all three of the websites .  ECF. No. 15 .  \nPlaintiffs also seek to have Defendants Cloudflare and third party Hostinger disable the domain \nnames, and cease to provide services to the Defendants.  Id.  The motion is unopposed.    \nOn September 8, 2025, counsel for Plaintiffs filed a status report indicating that “ Plaintiffs \nmet and conferred with defendant Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”) on September 3, 2025 ” and that \n“Cloudflare informed us that it takes no position on the Preliminary Injunction Motion and does \nnot intend to  oppose that motion or appear at the September 9, 2025 hearing, absent further \ndirection from the Court. ”  ECF No. 21 at 1.  \nII. JURISDICTION  \nThis Court has original jurisdiction over this matter under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this \nmatter arises under the federal laws of the United States, the Anticybersquatting and Consumer \nProtection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d).  Th e Court has jurisdiction over the in rem  action involving \nDefendant Isaacman Website under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(2) because the registrar of the website, \nCloudflare Inc., is located within this judicial district . \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nInjunctive relief is “an extraordinary remedy  that may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 \nU.S. 7, 22 (2008).  A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction “must establish that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in his f avor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  \nAm. Trucking Ass’ns , Inc. v. City of Los Angeles , 559 F.3d 1046, 1052 (9th Cir. 2009) (quoting \nWinter , 555 U.S. at 20).   Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 4 of 9 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  To grant preliminary injunctive relief, a court must find that “a certain threshold showing \n[has been] made on each factor.”  Leiva -Perez v. Holder , 640 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir. 2011) (per \ncuriam).  As to the first factor, a plaintiff is “not required to prove their claim, but only must show \nthat they [are] likely to succeed on the merits.”  Glossip v. Gross , 135 S.Ct. 2726, 2792 (2015).   \nThe Ninth Circuit employs a “sliding scale” approach to the four factors relevant to \npreliminary injunctive relief.   All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell , 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. \n2011) .  Under the sliding scale approach, “‘serious questions going to the merits’ and a balance of \nhardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff can support issuance of a preliminary injunction, \nso long as the plaintiff also shows that there is a likelihood o f irreparable injury and that the \ninjunction is in the public interest.”   Id. at 1135.    \nIV. ANALYSIS  \nPlaintiffs  seek a preliminary injunction pursuant to the ACPA to prevent Defendants’ \nillegal cybersquatting  over the domain name JaredIsaacmanCourtCase.com .  15 U.S.C. § 1125 (d).  \nBecause Mr. Isaacman ’s personal name  is unlikely to be a mark entitled to protection  under \n§ 1125 (d), the court does not find that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nACPA claim and  denies the motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nCongress passed the ACPA in 1999, amending the Lanham Act and adding two new \ncauses of action aimed specifically at cybersquatting.  Petroliam Nasional Berhad v. \nGoDaddy.com , Inc., 737 F.3d 546, 549 (9th Cir. 2013).  “[C]ybersquatting  occurs when a person \nother than the trademark holder registers the domain name of a well -known trademark and then \nattempts to profit from this by either ransoming the domain name back to the trademark holder or \nby using the domain name to divert business from the trademark holder to the domain name \nholder.”   Bosley Med. Inst., Inc. v. Kremer , 403 F.3d 672, 680 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting \nDaimlerChrysler v. The Net, Inc. , 388 F.3d 672, 689 (6th Cir.2004)) .  To prevail on a \ncybersquatting claim under the ACPA, “ the owner of a mark, including a personal name which is \nprotected as a mark under this sec tion, if, without regard to the goods or services of the parties ” \nmust show that the  defendant:  \n(i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark, including a Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 5 of 96 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  personal name which is protected as a mark under this section; \nand \n(ii) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that —\n(a)in the case of a mark that is distinctive at the time of\nregistration of the domain name, is identical or\nconfusingly similar to that mark;\n(b)in the case of a famous mark that is famous at the time of\nregistration of the domain name, is identical or\nconfusingly similar to or dilutive of that mark; or\n(c)is a trademark, word, or name protected by reason of\nsection 706 of title 18 or section 220506 of title 36.\n15 U.S.C. § 1125 (d)(1)(A).  \nHere, defendants have used Plaintiffs’ personal name in the domain name of the website, \nJaredIsaacmanCourtCase.com.  While the ACPA can apply to personal names, § 1125(d)(1)(A) \nclarifies that a cause of action is available only when the infringing domain includes “ a personal \nname which is protected as a mark under this section  [the Lanham Act].”   Plaintiffs admit that as a \ngeneral matter, personal names are not inherently distinctive and  therefore are not entitled to \ntrademark protection under the Lanham Act .  Mot. at 15.  They  contend , however, that § 1125(d)  \napplies  when the alleged cybersquatting is with regard to personal name that has  acquired a \nsecondary meaning or distinctiveness.   Id.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs argue that Mr. Isaacman’s \nname is protected because it is famous.  While the Court agree s that a  person ’s name that is not \ntrademarked could  be considered a protected mark under ACPA  if it acquires  secondary meaning , \nit finds that the plaintiffs have not established at this stage that Mr. Isaacman’s name is a mark \nwith secondary meaning.  \nUnder the Lanham Act,  a personal  name is a descriptive term.  Cairns v. Franklin Mint \nCo., 107 F. Supp. 2d 1212, 1222 (C.D. Cal. 2000) .  “A descriptive mark receives trademark \nprotection only when it establishes ‘secondary meaning ’ in the marketplace. ”  Black v. Irving \nMaterials, Inc. , 2019 WL 1995342, at *5 (N.D. Cal. May 6, 2019 ) (citing Yellow Cab Co. of \nSacramento v. Yellow Cab of Elk Grove, Inc. , 419 F.3d 925, 927 (9th Cir. 2005) ; see also  2 J. \nThomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition , § 13 :2 (5th ed. 2025 ).  \nSecondary meaning  only “occurs  when ‘in the minds of the public, the primary significance of [the \nname]  is to identify  the source of the product rather than the product itself.’”   Polin v. Behrman , \n2010 WL 11545054 at *4 (C.D. Cal. Dec. 13, 2010), aff'd, 429 F. App ’x 682 (9th Cir. 2011)  Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 6 of 9 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (citing Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc. , 529 U.S. 205, 211 (2000 )).   \nEstablishing that a personal name has acquired a secondary meaning is not easy .  In a case \nwhere Plaintiffs alleged  that the name  “Princess Diana of Wales” had acquired  the secondary \nmeaning of identifying  charitable and humanitarian services rather than the individual herself, the \ncourt wrote  that secondary meaning is not established “until the goods o r services submerge the \nprimary meaning of the name as a word identifying a person .”  Cairns , 107 F. Supp. 2d at 1222  \n(citing Visser v. Macres , 214 Cal.App.2d 249, 253  (1963) ).  The court went on to say that “[a] \nfinding of secondary meaning in this case would mean that the words ‘Diana,  Princess of Wales’ \nwould no longer primarily identify the individual, Princess Diana, but instead identify plaintiffs' \ncharitable activities.  This is an absurd contention to say the least.”   Cairns  at 1222.  \nMaking a finding that a personal name  has acquired a secondary meaning  therefore  \nrequires substantially more than a general allegation that the name of a proprietor is synonymous \nwith the services offered by a company he founded.  See Polin , 2010 WL 11545054 at *4  (finding \nthat the name of a plaintiff who  practiced family law  had not gained secondary meaning as long as \nthe name identified the plaintiff rather than services she offered).  Here, o ther than conclusory \nassertions in a declaration  filed in suppo rt of the Motion  that “Jared Isaacman”  is synonymous \nwith Shift4 , Plaintiffs provide no evidence that Mr. Isaacman’s  personal name has obtained \nsecondary meaning  such that  his name references Shift4 and its services rather than identifying \nMr. Isaacman himself .  ECF No. 16 -1 ¶4.  Instead, as is apparent from Plaintiffs ’ own declaration \nthat Mr. Isaacman is known for being an astronaut, pilot and potential NASA nominee , his \npersonal name  seems to reference only the man himself —a private citizen , albeit one of some \nnotoriety—rather than the payment processing offerings of Shift4 .  See ECF No. 16 -1 ¶5.  As a \nresult, the Court cannot conclude at this stage that Plaintiffs  possess a mark that is covered under \nthe ACPA.  \nPlaintiffs also contend that Mr. Isaacman’s name  is a mark under the ACPA  because the \nprovisions in § 1125(d)(1)(A)(ii) referencing  “famous” marks  offer protections  against \ncybersquatting  concerning the personal name of a famous person .  Mot at 15.  The statute , \nhowever , requires both that the defendant be utilizing “a mark, including a personal name Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 7 of 9 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  protected as a mark under this section ” and that the statute applies to marks that are either \n“distinctive ,” “famous ,” or otherwise statutorily protected.   § 1125(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  \nSince Mr. Isaacman’s name has not gained secondary meaning, § 1125(d) does not offer \nprotection against cybersquatting by a domain utilizing his name simply because he is a famous \nperson .  \nEven if the fame of a name was sufficient to grant it status as a protected mark , Plaintiffs \nalso have not provided evidence to support the contention that Mr. Isaacman’s name is a “famous  \nmark” as designated by the Lanham Act .  The Lanham Act  provides that “a mark is famous if it is \nwidely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source \nof the goods or services of the mark's owner. ”  15 U.S.C. § 1125 (c)(2).  The Act provides that \ncourts can consider the following factors in determining whether a mark “ possesses the requisite \ndegree of recognition ” including  “(i) The duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising and \npublicity of the mark, whether advertised or publicized by the owner or third parties ; (ii) The \namount, volume, and geogra phic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark ;  (iii) \nThe extent of actual recognition of the mark ;  (iv) Whether the mark was registered under the Act \nof March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register. ”  Id.  Plaintiffs do \nnot provide evidence that Mr. Isaacman’s name has been advertised or publicized widely ; that \ngoods or services have been provided for sale under Mr. Isaacman’s name specifically ; or any \nevidence of the extent of the actual recognition of h is name .  Therefore, even if fame w ere \nsufficient to establish protection for a name , Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that Mr. Isaacman’s \nname is famous for the purposes of being recognized as a mark under the Lanham Act.  \nAs a result, the Court cannot conclude, at least at this stage of the proceedings, that the Mr. \nIsaacman’s  personal name  is a “mark” for purposes of the ACPA .  While Plaintiffs’ may  be able to \nestablish that Defendants have a “ bad faith intent to profit ” utilizing Mr. Isaacman’s name in \npromoting The Lucky Trigger book  through the Books Website and Lucky Website, this does not \nsurmount the threshold showing that the Plaintiffs’ must be the owner of the protected mark that is \nbeing exploited.  § 1125(d)(1)(A).  Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not established a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their claims, or even raised “serious questions going to the Case 4:25-cv-06724-JST     Document 23     Filed 09/09/25     Page 8 of 99 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  merits ,” such that the Court need examine the other prongs of the preliminary injunction test. See \nWild Rockies , 632 F.3d at 1131 -1132 (9th Cir. 2011).    \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary \ninjunction and dissolves the temporary restraining order previous ly issued .1 \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   September 9, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nJON S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case concerns allegations against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, accused of collecting and mishandling user data, including biometric information, without consent, potentially violating U.S. privacy laws. The court approved a settlement agreement providing $92 million in monetary relief and extensive injunctive relief to prevent future privacy violations. The AI technology of TikTok, using machine learning to suggest content, is central to these privacy concerns.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether TikTok's data collection practices, including the use and sharing of personal and biometric information through its AI and ML systems, violated federal and state privacy laws and if the settlement agreement is fair and equitable to the affected class members.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court certified the class and subclass for settlement purposes, granting final approval of the $92 million settlement agreement, including injunctive relief, and approved the distribution of attorneys’ fees and service awards as determined.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a favorite app that lets you create and watch fun videos. Some people thought the app company was secretly taking information about them, like where they are and even their face data, without asking first. These people argued that it wasn’t fair or legal. The court decided that the company would pay money to the people affected and promised to do a better job protecting everyone's privacy in the future. The court also made sure lawyers got paid for helping fix the problem.",

Lee  \n) Magistrate Judge Sunil R. Harjani  \n) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n Tens of millions of  Americans use the social media and entertainment \napplication now known as TikTok (“TikTok” or “the App,” formerly known as \n“Musical.ly ”) to view, create, and share short videos.   That is all well and good, but \naccording to the lead plaintiffs (“Plaintiffs”) in this mult idistrict litigation (“MDL”), \nthe App’s widespread popula rity comes  at the expense of its users’ privacy rights.  On \nbehalf of a putative class comprising all TikTok users in the United States  (an \nestimated  89 million people) and a subclass of Illinois use rs, Plaintiffs allege that  \nByteDance , Inc.  (the China -based company that created TikTok)  and its \nsubsidiaries —TikTok, Inc ., TikTok, Ltd., ByteDance Inc., and Beijing ByteDance \nTechnology Co., Ltd. (collectively, “Defendants”) —have used the App to \nsurreptitiously harvest and profit from  collecting  the private information of users in \nviolation of numerous  federal and state cons umer privacy laws.  \nLast year, t he Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of a \nclass action settlement that would provide monetary relief to class members in the \nform of a $92 million settlement fund, as well as broad injunctive relief p rohibiting Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 1 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n \n Defendants from engaging in the alleged privacy violations going forward.  See In re \nTikTok, Inc. Consumer Priv. Litig. , 565 F. Supp. 3d  1076  (N.D. Ill.  2021 ), ECF No. \n161.  \nNow, after disseminating notice to the class and receiving approximately 1.4 \nmillion claims, Plaintiffs have filed a motion  for final approval of the settlement , as \nwell as  a motion for attorneys’ fees , expenses, and service awards.   Various objectors \nhave filed objections to both motions, as well as their own fee  and service award \npetitions.   For the following reasons, the Court  certifies the Nationwide Class and \nIllinois Subclass for purposes of the settlement , grants Plaintiffs’ motion for approval \nof the  settlement , approves  the fee and service award petitions to the extent stated \nbelow, and makes other rulings as applicable . \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nI.

Background1 \nA. Factual and Early  Procedural History  \nThe App  is a social media and entertainment platform  that allows users to \nview, create , and share  short videos .  Using the App, individuals can  record videos  \nand overlay them with visual effects, background music , and other enhance ments.  \nSee Consol. Am. Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 127 –28 (“Compl.”) , ECF No. 114.  After \nrecording a video, a user can either save the video to their device or “post” the video \nto their TikTok account.  See id. ¶¶ 146–47. \nWhen a user posts a video  to their account , the video is shared with the user’s \n“followers” (that is, other users  who subscribe to see the user’s content) and also is \nposted publicly and displayed to users across the world using the App’s proprietary \ncontent -delivery algorithm .  Id. ¶¶ 2, 7 –9, 128.  The algorithm  uses artificial \nintelligence technologies and machine learning  to gather information about a user \nand to predict what types of videos the user would want to see .  Id. ¶¶ 8–9.  The App \nthen shows the user  a curated  feed of content  (and advertisements) based on  those \npredictions.2  Id. ¶ 141. \n \n \n1  The Court assumes familiarity with the facts of this case as stated in the Preliminary \nApproval Order .  See In re TikTok , 565 F. Supp. 3d at 1079 –83. \n  \n2  For example, if a user “likes” or comments on a video of a dog dancing to a popular \nsong, the App’s algorithm will “learn”  about the user’s preference for such videos and will \nadjust to show the user more videos involving dogs or other animals dancing to music on the \nuser’s video feed.   See Compl. ¶ 268 . \n Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 4 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n \n The simultaneous success and secrecy of TikTok’s proprietary AI technology \nhas prompted considerable backlash from privacy advocates, politicians, and the \nUnited States  government.  In February 2019, the  Federal Trade Commission  \nentered into a consent decree with several Defendants over the App’s purported \nviolations of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act  (“COPPA”) , 15 U.S.C. \n§ 6501 et seq.3  The Department of Defense expressed concerns that its employees’ \nuse of the App raised security issues  because of the App’s  “ability to convey location, \nimage and biometric data to its Chinese parent company .”  Compl. ¶ 6.  And several \nUnited States  Senators called on the i ntelligence community to investigate TikTok’s  \nalleged ties to the Chinese government and its potential as a “target of foreign \ninfluence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on U nited States -\nbased social media platforms.”  Letter from Senator Charles E. Schumer and Senator \nTom Cotton to Joseph Maguire, Acting Director of National Intelligence (Nov. 27, \n2019) (on file with the U nited States  Senate) , https://www.democrats.senate.gov/  \nimo/media/doc/10232019%20TikTok%20Letter%20 -%20FINAL%20PDF.pdf . \nThese privacy concerns also prompted a wave of putative class action  lawsuits \nagainst TikTok  in federal courts across the country .  Beginning in 2018, several \nplaintiffs’ law firms began to investigate whether Defendants’ AI and machine \n \n \n3  Press Release, Video Social Networking App Musical.ly Agrees to Sett le FTC \nAllegations That It Violated Children’s Privacy Law , FTC (Feb. 27, 2019), \nhttps://www.ftc.gov/news -events/news/press -releases/2019/02/video -social -networking -app-\nmusically -agrees -settle -ftc-allegations -it-violated -childrens -privacy  (last accessed May 20, \n2022).  \n Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 5 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n \n learning technolog ies violate d United States  privacy laws.  The investigations focused \nin particular on whether the App’s video camera collect ed, retain ed, and distribute d \nApp users’ facial reco gnition information or other biometric information without the \nusers’ authorization .  See Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Approval Class Action Settlement  (“Mot. \nPrelim. Approval”) , Rhow Decl. ¶¶ 8 –10, ECF No. 122 -8.  The investigations also \nexplored whether the App harvest ed other types of private information, such as \ngeolocation data, video viewing histories, unpublished TikTok videos  (i.e., those not \n“saved” or “posted”) , and personal identifying information such as email addresses, \nsocial media account information, or cell phone data, and  whether Defendants  \ntransferred  that data to third parties.   Id.; see, e.g. , Compl. ¶¶ 155 –57.  \nThe first case against TikTok  based on these allegations  was filed in the \nNorthern Dis trict of California in November 2019.  See Hong v. ByteDance, Inc. , No. \n19 C 7792 (N.D. Cal.).   Other lawsuits  followed  in the Northern District of California, \nthe Central District of California, the Southern District of Illinois, and the Northern \nDistrict  of Illinois , including  one in this Court.  See E.R. v. TikTok, Inc. , No 20 C 2810 \n(N.D. Ill.).   Eventually, the burgeoning of litigation led the Judicial Panel on \nMultidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) to consolidate the then -nineteen related actions and \nto transfer them to this Court for pretrial proceedings on August 4, 2020.  See In re \nTikTok, Inc., Consumer Priv. Litig. , 481 F.  Supp. 3d 1331, 1332 (J.P.M.L. 2020); \nJPML Transfer Order, In re TikTok  (N.D. Ill. Aug. 12, 2020), ECF No. 2.  \nBy that point,  the political tensions surrounding TikTok had reached their \nzenith .  Just two days after the JPML’s transfer order, President Donal d Trump Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 6 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n \n issued an executive order declaring that TikTok’s continued operation in the United \nStates presented “a national emergency” that “threaten [ed] the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States .”  Exec. Order No. 13,942, 85 FED. \nREG. 48,637 (Aug. 6, 2020).  According to the executive order , immediate action was \nnecessary because TikTok’s “data collection threaten [ed] to allow the Chinese \nCommunist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information.”  Id.  \nThe order gave ByteDance an ultimatum: sell TikTok’s U nited States  operations to \nan American company within forty -five days or face a ban of the App in this country.  \nSee id.4  \nAfter the Trump Administration’s order, Defendants’ motivation to settle the \nnewly -consolidated cases  was at an all -time high given its need to shed TikTok’s \nliabilities in preparation for its anticipated sale.  See Pls.’ Mot. Final Approval Class \nAction S ettlement at 9 –10 (“Mot. Final Approval”), ECF No. 195 .  The attorneys in \nHong  had already engaged in months of comprehensive settlement discussions with \nDefendants, including a round of mediation in April 2020 led by Layn Phillips, a  \nprominent  retired fed eral judge .  Id. at 8.  To  that point , however,  the parties had not \nbeen successful.  Id.; see generally Mot. Prelim. Approval, Carroll Decl., ECF No. 122 -\n6 (discussing pre -MDL settlement negotiations) ; Rhow Decl . (same) . \n \n \n4  ByteDance initially agreed to sell its U nited States  operations of TikTok to Oracle and \nWalmart later in September 2020, but a final agreement never materialized, and the Biden \nAdministration ultimately abandoned the Trump Administration’s threat to ban the App.   \nSee, e.g. , Bobby Allyn, Biden Administration  Pauses Trump’s TikTok Ban, Backs Off Pressure \nto Sell App , NAT’L PUB. RADIO  (Feb. 10, 2021), https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966584204/   \n(last accessed May 20, 2022).  Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 7 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n \n On August 13, 2020 , Plaintiffs’  counsel in E.R., a case originally filed in this \nCourt,  was able to assemble a coalition of attorney representatives from the various \nconsolidated cases to attend a second round of mediation before Judge Phillips in \nhopes of achieving a global settlement.   Mot. Final Approval at 8–9; Carroll Decl. \n¶¶ 16–19.  That thirteen -hour sessio n proved fruitful  and concluded with a  \nsettlement  agreement in principle and a signed term sheet.  Mot. Final Approval  at \n10.  The parties memorialized the settlemen t in a signed agreement on September 4, \n2020.  Id. \n Meanwhile, a s part of its management of the MDL, the Court solicited \napplications from the attorneys who represent ed the various plaintiff classes in the \nMDL to serve as Lead Counsel and in other leadersh ip roles .  In September 2020, the \nCourt selected three attorneys —Katrina Carroll, Ekwan Rhow, and Elizabeth \nFegan —to serve as Co-Lead Counsel ; attorney Shannon Marie McNulty to serve as \nLiaison Counsel ; and five attorneys —Jonathan Jagher, Megan E. Jones, M ichael \nGervais, Amanda K. Klevorn, and Albert Y. Chang —to serve on the Plaintiffs’ \nExecutive Committee .  See Case Management Order No. 3, ECF No. 94 (appointing \ncounsel  to these roles ). \nThese attorneys worked with Defendants over the fall and winter of 2020 to \nassess the initial terms of settlement  and negotiate revised terms  to address the \nvarious concerns raised by different plaintiff groups.  As part of this process, \nPlaintiffs’ counse l also conducted a substantial amount of confirmatory discovery, \nwhich included interrogatories, document requests, and written depositions, and Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 8 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n \n arranged for a computer programming expert to inspect the App’s source code onsite .  \nSee In re TikTok , 565 F. S upp. 3d at 1080 –81.    \nB. Plaintiffs’ Claims  \nOne product of these efforts was  a consolidated amended class action complaint  \nfiled toward s the end of  2020.  The complaint proposes  two classes.  First, the \ncomplaint defines a Nationwide Class comprised of a ll United States residents who \nhad used the App prior to preliminary approval of the settlement.  Compl. ¶ 322.  \nSecond, the complaint seeks certification of an Illinois Subclass comprised of all \nIllinois residents who had used the App to create one or mor e videos prior to the \npreliminary approval of the settlement.  Id.  A brief summary of the classes’ claims \nfollows.  \n1.   Nationwide  Class Claims  \nOn behalf of the Nationwide Subclass , the complaint asserts  claims under \nfederal statutes, as well as claims under California statutes  and common law .  \nFirst, the complaint asserts for the Nationwide Class that Defendants have \nviolated the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”), 18 U.S.C. § 1030, and \nits Ca lifornia analogue, the Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act \n(“CCDAFA”), CAL. PENAL CODE § 502, by collecting personal information and data, \nincluding user or device identifiers, biometric information, and unpublished TikTok \nvideos, from App use rs’ cell phones without authorization.  Compl. ¶¶ 339 –41, 345 –\n46.   Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 9 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n \n Next, Plaintiffs bring a claim under the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”), \n18 U.S.C. § 2710, which creates a private cause of action against a “video tape service \nprovider who knowingly discloses, to any person” the “personally identifiable \ninformation” of its consumers.  Id. § 2710(b).  According to Plaintiffs, Defendants have \nviolated VPPA by knowingly disclosing App users’ personally identifiable \ninformation, including a record of the videos the user has watched, a record of the \nvideos the user has “liked ” or commented on, and the identities of the user’s followers, \nto Facebook and Google.  See Compl. ¶ 397.   \nAdditionally , Plaintiffs  assert that, in failing to disclose that they collect and \ndisseminate App users’ personal information, Defendants have viol ated two \nCalifornia consumer protection statutes5: the California Unfair Competition Law \n(“UCL”), CAL. BUS. & PROF. CODE § 17200 et seq ., which bans “unlawful, unfair, or \nfraudulent business act[s] or practice[s],” id., and the California False Advertisin g \nLaw (“FAL”), id. § 17500 et seq. , which prohibits any “unfair, deceptive, untrue, or \nmisleading advertising.”  Id.; see Compl. ¶¶ 372 –78, 381 –85.   \nPlaintiffs also assert  three claims under California constitutional and common \nlaw.  First, they argue that Defendants’ collection and dissemination of their private \ninformation  violates the right to privacy enshrined in article I of the California \nConstitution.  See CAL. CONST . art. I § 1 ; Compl. ¶¶ 351 –53.  Second, Plaintiffs raise  \n \n \n5 Plaintiffs also assert claims pursuant to several other state consumer protection \nstatutes on behalf of a “Multi -State Consumer Protection Class,” “in the alternative” to a \nNationwide Class.  Id. ¶ 419; see id.  ¶ 322 n.167 (listing states with consumer fra ud laws that \nmay apply to Defendants’ conduct ). Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 10 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n \n a claim based on the  common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion , arguing that the \ncollection of App users’ personal information constitutes an  “intentional interference \nwith [ their ] interest in so litude or seclusion . . . of a kind that would be highly \noffensive to a reasonable man.”  RESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS § 652B cmt. a ( AM. \nLAW INST. 1977) (updated Oct. 2021) ; see Compl. ¶ 363.  \nLastly , Plaintiffs seek r ecovery under a theory of unjust enri chment , \ncontending that Defendants derived revenues and profits from the dissemination and \ntransfer of App users’ private and personal information.  Compl. ¶ 387 ; see \nRESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT § 1 cmt. a ( AM. LAW \nINST. 2011)  (recovery under the doctrine of unjust enrichment is appropriate when \nthe defendant “recei[ves] a benefit whose retention without payment would result in \nthe unjust enrichment of the defendant at the expense of the claimant”).   \n2.   Illinois Subclass Claims  \n  The Illinois Subclass  asserts claims  under the Illinois Biometric Information \nPrivacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/1 et seq. , which “embodies a fundamental \npolicy of the state of Illinois. . . . of protecting its citizens’ right to privacy  in their \npersonal biometric data,” and in particular, its “concerns about the use of new \ntechnology by ‘[m]ajor national corporations’ to collect personal biometric data.”  In \nre Facebook Biometric Info. Priv. Litig. , 185 F. Supp. 3d 1155, 1169 (N.D. Cal.  2016) \n(“In re Facebook ”) (quoting 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/5(b)).  In short , BIPA requires a \nprivate entity that collects biometric information  (defined as “any information . . . \nbased on an individual’s . . . retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 11 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n \n or face geometry,” 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/10 ) to “inform the subject or ‘the subject’s \nlegally authorized representative’ in writing about several things, such as the \npurpose of collecting the data and how long they will be kept, and obtai n the consent \nof the subject or authorized representative.”  Miller v. Sw. Airlines Co. , 926 F.3d 898, \n900 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting § 14/15(b)).   \nBIPA also prohibits sales and limits transfers of biometric information and \nrequires custodians to establish protocols for retaining the information and protecting \nit from disclosure.  See id.  at 901 (citing § 14/15(a) –(e)).  Successful BIPA plaintiffs \nmay recover either actual damages or liquidated damages —$1,000 for negligent \nviolations and $5,000 for intention al or reckless violations —plus attorneys ’ fees, \ncosts, and injunctive relief.  See § 14/20.  \n  Here, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants have violated BIPA by harvesting App \nusers’ facial scans without obtaining their consent, and by transferring and selling \nusers’ biometric information to third parties.  Compl. ¶¶ 408 –10.  Plaintiffs also allege \nthat Defendants routinely violate BIPA’s disclosure and retention requirements.  Id. \n¶¶ 411 –15. \nC. Proposed Settlement Agreement  \nIn exchange for a release of all  of the se claims , and any potential claims based \non Defendants’ collection or handling of App users’ data,6 the Settlement Agreement \n \n \n6  More specifically, the release covers “any and all claims, complaints, actions, \nproceedings, or remedies of any kind . . . arising from or related to the Civil Actions or the \ncollection and use of any user  data, including biometric data . . . arising from the beginning \n Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 12 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n \n provides for monetary relief in the form of a $92 million settlement fund and a range \nof injunctive remedies to prevent De fendants from engaging in the alleged privacy \nviolations in the future.  \n1.   Monetary Relief  \nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Defendants have agreed to pay $92 \nmillion into an escrow account, to be distributed among class members according to \na Court -approved plan of allocation.  See Mot. Prelim. Approval Ex. C, Proposed Plan \nof Allocation, ECF No. 122 -3.  The plan provides that the settlement funds are to be \npaid out in the following descending order: (1) payment of expenses incurred in \nconnection with a dministering the settlement; (2) taxes associated with the \nsettlement; (3) attorneys’ fees, service fees, and other fee awards; and (4) payment to \nclass members who submitted valid claims.  Settlement Agreement § 5.2.  \nOnce administration costs, taxes, and fees are distributed, the remainder of \nthe settlement fund will be divided into prorated shares “that are equal to the sum of \n(1) the total number of valid claims submitted by Nationwide Class members and \n(2) the total number of valid claims sub mitted by Illinois Subclass members \nmultiplied by five.”  Mot. Final Approval at 14.  Each Nationwide Class member who \nsubmitted a valid claim will receive one prorated share, and each Illinois Subclass \nmember  who submitted a valid claim  will receive six p rorated shares —one as a \n \n \nof time” to the date that the final approval of the settlement is either affirmed on appeal or \nthe date that the time to appeal the final approval order has expired .

Based on Plaintiffs’ estimates,  each Nationwide Class claimant  will receive $ 27.19 \nand each Illinois Subclass claimant  will receive $ 163.13 in monetary relief from the \nsettlement.  See id. ; Platt Decl. ¶ 43 , ECF No. 196 . \n2.   Injunctive Relief   \nThe Settlement Agreement also contains expansive injunctive remedies.   As \npart of the settlement, Defendants have agreed to refrain, and upon approval of the \nsettlement will be enjoined, from engaging the following conduct, unless disclosed \nexpressly in TikTok’s Privacy Policy: (1) using the App to collect or store a user’s7 \nbiometric information; (2) using the App to collect geolocation or GPS data; (3) us ing \nthe App to collect information in users’ clipboards;8 (4) using the App to transmit user \ndata outside of the United States ; (5) storing user data in databases outside  of the \nUnited States ; and (6) uploading content generated by users to the App’s servers \nbefore the user saves or publishes it.  Settlement Agreement §§ 6.1 –6.2; see generally \nid. at Addendum  § 4.   \nDefendants also pledge to create, at their own expense, a  comprehensive data \nprivacy training and compliance program for all newly hired employees and \ncontractors and to institute annual privacy training for all employees.  Id. § 6.3.  And \n \n \n7  All references to “a user” or “users” in the Settlement Agreement refer to a United \nStates user or users.   \n \n8  A phone’s “clipboard” is the function that allows the user to store text, images, and \nvideos for the purpose of copying and pasting them within an app or between apps.

Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 14 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n \n Defendants have agreed to pay for a third  party  to monitor this training for three \nyears and to provide written verification of the review.  Id. at Addendum § 4.3.  \nD. Order Granting Preliminary Approval  \nOn February 25, 2021, Plaintiffs presented the Settlement Agreement , the \nplan of allocation, and a proposed notice plan to this Court for preliminary approval. \nSee Mot. Prelim. Approval.   Three objections  to the preliminary approval motion  were \nfiled: one by Mark S., ECF No. 126 ; one by Dennis Litteken, ECF No. 132 ; and one by  \nBrian Behnken and Joshua Duga s, ECF No. 142.  \nAfter the parties submitted supplemental briefs regarding  the adequacy of \nrepresentation of minor class members,  the possibility of  in-App notice, and the \nprocess by which Plaintiffs valued the claims, the Cou rt granted Plaintiffs’ motion for \npreliminary approval on September 30, 2021.  See generally In re TikTok , 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 1076 ; Order Granting Prelim. Approval Class Action Settlement, In re \nTikTok  (N.D. Ill. Oct. 1, 2021) (setting forth procedures for no tice, filing claims and \nobjections, and the final approval process)  (“10/1/21 Order”) , ECF No. 162.  \nThe Court made three principal  findings  at the preliminary approval stage .  \nFirst, it found that it “[would] likely be able to certify” the proposed classes for \npurposes of approving the settlement.   In re TikTok , 565 F. Supp. 3d at 1087 ; see FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23(e)(1)(B)(ii).  Second, the Court found  that the proposed settlement was \n“within the range of fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy” in light o f numerous \nfactors, including the strength of Plaintiffs’ case, the complexity of potential ongoing  \nlitigation, the amount of opposition to the settlement , and the reaction from class Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 15 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n \n members.  In re TikTok , 565 F. Supp. 3d at 1087  (citing Wong v. Accretiv e Health, \nInc., 773 F.3d 859, 863 (7th Cir. 2014) (listing certain factors to be considered)).   \nFinally, the Court approved the proposed notice plan because it provided the best \nnotice practicable to all class members, with the caveat that Defendants were \nrequired to provide in -App notice of the settlement to American users.  Id. at 1091 –\n92; see id. at 1094 . \nIn making these findings, the Court overruled three objections to preliminary \napproval.  The Court first overruled Litteken’s objections that the Settl ement \nAgreement undervalue d Plaintiffs’ claims .   In doing so, the Court  noted that In re \nFacebook , the case Litteken cited to support his contention that the settlement \nundervalued the BIPA claims , was “a poor comparator”  because Defendants, unlike \nFacebook, do not concede that they use facial recognition technology to harvest App \nusers’ biometric information.  See id.  at 1090 (citing In re Facebook , No. 15-cv-3747 –\nJD, 2018 WL 2197546, at *2 (N.D. Cal. May 14, 2018)).  \nThe C ourt also rejected Mark S.’s argument that the settlement did not account \nfor conflicts between minor and non -minor class members.  It found Mark S.’s \ncontention that minor class members should receive more  compensation because they \ncould potentially  disaf firm the arbitration agreements  in the App’s terms of service \nunpersuasive,  because disaffirmance would likely  “require individual minor class \nmembers, at the very least, to stop using the App ,” which seems improbable.  Id. at \n1085 –86. Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 16 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>17 \n \n Additionally, t he Co urt rejected Mark S.’s argument that the Court should \nhave denied preliminary approval because Plaintiffs had not undertaken a detailed \nquantitative analysis of the net expected value of continued litigation to the class .  \nInstead, the Court found  that the re were “other reliable indicators” —including the \nhard -fought negotiation process, two rounds of arbitration supervised by a former \nfederal judge, and substantial confirmatory discovery —that supported a finding of \nreasonableness.  Id. at 1087  (quoting Kaufman v. Am. Exp . Travel Related Servs. Co. , \n877 F.3d 276, 285 (7th Cir. 2017)); see id.  at 1088 –89. \nFinally, the Court overruled Behnken and Dugas’s objection to the opt -out \nprocedure.  Behnken and Dugas argued that the notice plan’s requireme nt that class \nmembers who desire to opt -out of the settlement complete, sign, and mail individual \nopt-out request forms to Plaintiffs’ counsel violated their due process rights.  Id. at \n1092.  But as the Court noted, the requirement that class members indi vidually fill \nout and mail an opt -out request form is “a common and practical requirement” that \nis “consistently enforced” in MDL settlements .  Id. at 1093 (quoting In re Deepwater \nHorizon , 819 F.3d 190, 197 (5th Cir. 2016)); see id.  (collecting cases) .  Accordingly, the \nCourt concluded that the opt -out procedure did not violate due process.  \nE. The Notice Program and Claims  Submission  Period  \n1.   Notice  Program  \nAfter the Court granted preliminary approval, Plaintiffs disseminated  notice \nto the class through a notice program  developed by the settlement administrator, \nAngeion  Group  (“Angeion”) .  Mot . Final Approval at 18; see generally  Platt Decl .  Per Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 17 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>75 \n \n  Loevy claims that, were it not for Mark S.’s  efforts to carve out the claims of \nclass members  under the age of thirteen (“under -13 class members”) in this action  \nfrom the release i n T.K., no under -13 class members  would have been able to \nparticipate in th is settlement .  As a result, Loevy  contends , Mark S.  added at least \n$6,256,000 —the prorated share of the common fund that is attributable to under -13 \nclass members —in value to the settlement  and requests twenty -five percent of that \nnumber, or $1,564,000, in fees .  \n The proposition  that Mark S . is responsibl e for the ability of under -13 class \nmembers to participate in this settlement is without merit .  As the T.K. court \nrecognized  in denying Loevy ’s fee petition based on nearly identical arguments  there , \nin as early as the fall of 2020 , Plaintiffs and Defenda nts had “‘expressly negotiated \nthe right of class members  in the T.K. settlement class . . . to participate in the MDL \nsettlement class’” in order to “eliminate any potential impact” of the T.K. settlement \non this case, all without any input from Mark S.  Joint Status Report at 3  (N.D. Ill. \nOct. 30, 2020) , ECF No. 99; see T.K., 2022 WL 888943, at *27.   While those \nnegotiations were underway , Mark S. —far from working to preserve the rights of T.K. \nclass members to participate in this settlement —in fact was requesting  that the T.K. \ncourt enforce the T.K. preliminary injunction against class members in this case in \n \n \nthe Court sustain any of [his] objections.” Obj ector  Litteken’s Provisional Pet. Service Award \nat 4, ECF No. 193.  Because Litteken’s objections  to final approv al of the settlement  and to \nattorneys’ fees have been overruled in their entirety, they have not made a material \ndifference to the benefit of class members .  Accordingly, the Court will not entertain any such \nmotion.  Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 75 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>76 \n \n order to get the MDL reassigned to the T.K. docket.  See Notice of Filing Ex. A, \nObjector Mark S. ’s Mot. Enforcement Prelim. Inj. and Reassignment and \nConsol idation  Related TikTok  MDL, T.K., No. 19 C 7915 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 9, 2020), ECF \nNo. 59.  Given the considerable resources Mark S. expended in trying to unravel the \nsettlement , the Court finds Mark S.’s contention  that he was acting in the best \ninterests of the class es in this case  without merit . \nMark S. also argues that his counsel should receive a fee award  because he was \nthe first to propose the in -App notice .  While the Court is confident that the notice \nprogram would have satisfied the Rule 23 and due process requirements without the \nin-App notice, it nonetheless acknowledges that in -App notice conferred a material \nbenefit to the settlement class es.  And the Co urt finds that Loevy  does deserve some \ncompensation  for this contribution . \nThat being said, Loevy’s  fee request of $1,564,000 far exceeds that \ncontribution.  The Court similarly declines to award Loevy their reported lodestar  of \n$564,938.75 , because  Loevy’ s timesheets reveal that much of the work done in \nconnection with this MDL was devoted to undermining the settlement by attempting \nto enforce the T.K. preliminary injunctio n.  See In re Sw. Airlines , 898 F.3d at 745  \n(citing  Mirfaishi v. Fleet Mortg. Corp. , 551 F.3d 682, 687 –88 (7th Cir. 2008) (awarding \nobjectors a small percentage of their requested fees after balancing the “very slight \nimprovement” to the settlement against the objectors’ “lack of constructive activity in \nthe district court,” id. at 687, and the “detriment caused by their courtroom antics.” \nId. at 688)).  Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 76 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>77 \n \n Accordingly, the Court awards Loevy  $100,000 in fees.  Having reviewed \nLoevy’s timesheets, the Court finds that this award approximates the  percentage of \nLoevy’s time  that was devoted  to improving the notice program.  The Court will not \naward Loevy fees for any other work, because that work did not benefit  (and indeed, \nin many cases attempted  to harm)  the class.    \n4. Incentive and Service Awards  \nBecause a named plaintiff “is an essential ingredient of any class action,” Camp \nDrug Store , 897 F.3d at 834 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court may \nauthorize incentive awards “when necessary to induce individuals to become named \nrepresentatives.”  Douglas , 328 F.R.D. at 218 (quoting Synthroid I , 264 F.3d at 722). \n“To determine if an incentive award is warranted, a district court evaluates the \nactions the plaintiff has taken to protect the interests of the class, the degree to which \nthe class has benefitted  from those actions, and the amount of time and effort the \nplaintiff expended in pursuing the litigation.”   Camp Drug Store , 897 F.3d at 834 \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \n Class Counsel seek an incentive award of $2,500 for each of the t hirty -five \nnamed Plaintiffs.36  At the outset of the cases, t he thirty -five named Plaintiffs \nprovided Class Counsel with extensive details about their use of the App, including \nwhen they downloaded it, how frequently they used it, whether they made any vid eos, \n \n \n36  The named Plaintiffs are : Katherine Czajka; Misty Hong; Aparna Iyer; Brandy \nJohnson; Morgan  Kukovec ; Karina Quinteiro; and Meghan Smith; and minors A.S.  ex rel.  \nLaurel Slothower ; A.S. ex rel.  A.S.; A.R.; G.R.; C.W.; I.W.; P.S.; M.T.W.; N.T.; L.T.; S.P .; J.P.; \nK.P.; G.P.; L.M.; A.J .; E.R.; R.S.; J.S.; S.A.; L.B.; L.P.; M.P.; A.O.; H.S.; K.M.; C.H.; and D.M.  Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 77 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>78 \n \n whether their videos contain recordings of their faces, and whether they used any of \nthe App’s video editing features or facial filters in their videos.  See generally Compl. \n¶¶ 19 –98.  These disclosures of Plaintiffs’ personal and private information  \nsubstantially benefited the classes by validating Class Counsel’s legal theories and \nhelping them to understand the App’s technology.    \nThe named representatives also expended time and effort on the case after the \nsettlement agreement  was reached  by appro ving Class Counsel’s pleadings and \ncontinuing to assist in confirmatory discovery.   And the se efforts result ed in \nsubstantial benefi ted the class  as well .   \nLastly, empirical data indicates  that the requested incentive awards are \nmodest .  A study of approximately 1,200 class actions showed that the median \nincentive award per plaintiff was $5,250, over twice the amount Class Counsel \nrequests here.  5 RUBENSTEIN § 17:8  tbl.1.  Thus, t he Court finds the request of $2,500 \nper named Plaintiff to be reasonable  and appropriate . \n Mark S. and Litteken also seek service awards of $2,500 and $1,000, \nrespectively.  See In re Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n , 332 F.R.D. at 228 –29 (awarding \nservice awards to objectors).  For the reasons stated  above , the Co urt concludes that \nMark S.  benefit ted the class to some degree by advocating  for in -App notice , but not \nto the degree of the named Plaintiffs.  A ccordingly , the Court provides him with a \nservice award of $1,500 .   \nAs for Litteken, t he Court is not convince d that he deserves as much  credit for \nthe in -App notice, given that  Mark S.  was the first to raise the issue.  Nevertheless, Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 78 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>79 \n \n \nbecause Litteken’s insistence on in-App notice  impacted the Court’s assessment of the \ncosts and benefits of it, the Court finds that Litteken’s request for a $1,000 service \naward is appropriate, and it is granted . \nIII. Conclusion  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court certifies the Nationwide Class and \nIllinois Subclass ; grants the motion for final approval of the  Settlement Agreement  \n[195] ; and grants the petitions for fees and service awards  [193][197][201]  to the \nextent stated above.   Additionally, the motion to accept opt -outs [207] is granted.   Co-\nLead Counsel is instructed to provide a proposed final order wi thin the next five days.  \n  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, GovernmentGPT (“GovGPT”), an AI-focused startup, sued Axon Enterprise, Microsoft, and Safariland for alleged antitrust violations and false advertising. GovGPT claimed that these companies engaged in illegal acquisitions and anticompetitive actions, particularly alleging that Microsoft's exclusive cloud service agreement with Axon and Safariland's sale of a subsidiary to Axon harmed competition. The court dismissed the case against all defendants, citing lack of personal jurisdiction over Safariland, and finding GovGPT failed to sufficiently allege an antitrust injury or state a claim for relief.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The main legal issues include whether the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendants, especially Safariland, and whether GovGPT had sufficiently alleged antitrust injuries to establish standing under the Sherman and Clayton Acts.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the case against Safariland due to lack of personal jurisdiction and dismissed the claims against Microsoft and Axon for failure to allege plausible antitrust injuries and articulate a valid legal claim. The court allowed GovGPT an opportunity to file an amended complaint to address these deficiencies.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if three big companies, who are like the popular kids on the playground, were accused by a new kid, GovGPT, of unfairly teaming up and not letting anyone else join their games. The new kid says this stops others from playing and having fun. But when they went to the playground referee, the referee didn’t see enough evidence or bad behavior from the popular kids. So, the referee told the new kid to go try again, but he needs a better reason and more proof next time to even consider doing something about it.",

No. CV-24-01869 -PHX -SMB  \n \nORDER  \n \n  \n Before the Court are Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”), Axon Enterprise Inc. \n(“Axon”) , and Safariland LLC’s  (“Safariland”)  separate Motions to Dismiss ( Doc. 90; Doc. \n106; Doc. 110; Doc. 111)  Plaintiff GovernmentGPT Inc.’s (“GovGPT”) First Amended \nComplaint  (“FAC”)  (Doc. 74) .  The briefing is complete , and the Motions  are ripe.  Having \nreviewed the briefing and the relevant case law, the Court will grant  Axon’s Motion , grant  \nMicrosoft’s Motion, and grant  Safariland’s Motion  to Dismiss for Lack of Personal \nJurisdiction (Doc. 110 ) but  deny  Safariland’s  Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a \nClaim (Doc. 111) as moot . \nI. BACKGROUND  \nDespite the FAC clocking in at just under one -hundred and ten pages, the \nbackground of this case is rather straightforward.  In capsule form , this action  arises from  \na series of alleged illegal acquisitions and anticompetitive agreements occurring between  \nthe named Defendants.   (See Doc. 74.)   Now, b efore describing  the background o f those \nclaims , the Court will briefly discuss the procedural history of this case . Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 1 of 40 \n- 2 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n A. Procedural History  \nGovGPT  and a group of now -excised Plaintiffs  filed their Initial  Complaint on July \n29, 2024.  (Doc. 1.)  They concurrently filed  a Motion for Preliminary Injunction titled:  \n“Emergency Motion for Immediate Order to Prohibit use of Axon Body 4 Cameras at \nPolitical Events,” citing the potential danger Quectel “chips” housed in the  Axon Body 4 \n(the “AB4”) .  (Doc. 2  at 2.)  Shortly after the filings, this  Court set a telephonic status \nconference to discuss the Motion (Doc. 23) .  At that conference, the Court a nnounced that \nit would  forego a hearing and  take the Motion under advisement.  (Doc. 51.)  \nWhile the Court was considering the request for a preliminary injunction, Axon and \nMicrosoft filed Motions to Dismiss the Initial Complaint.  (Doc. 66; Doc. 67; Doc. 68.) \nShortly thereafter, the Court  denied GovGPT’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. \n2), finding that the Motion , the supporting memoranda, and the initial Complaint failed to \nsupport ordering the requested relief.  ( See Doc. 71.)  In that Order , the Court scrutinized \nGovGPT’s allegations about  the Quectel “chips ,” finding them to be unsu bstantiated.  (See \nid.)  There, the  Court also ordered GovGPT and former Plaintiff Raj Abhyanker to appear \nfor a hearing  in which they needed to (1) justify the filing of the “emergency motion” \nabsent any actual testing of the AB4 and  (2) to support the repeated allegations that a \nhackable Quectel “chip” is used in the AB4.  ( Id. at 11.)   \nAt the hearing, the Court asked Mr. Abhyanker whether he had  tested or specifically \nidentified the presence of a Quectel “chip”  in the AB4 that was  susceptible to hacking by \nthe Chinese Communist Party.  (Doc. 105 at  25–26.)  Mr. Ab hyanker responded, stating : \nThey are unidentified chips, not all of them are identified. Some of them are \nfrom Qualcomm, some are not identified, but there is an ESMT chip which \nhas a label on that directly. If you look that up, directly up right now, it is a \nchip that’s made in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan. And so it’s \nnot true to say they’re all Quectel chips. There is a whole bunch of other \nsmaller chips underneath there — \n. . . . \nWell, an integrated circuit board is what I called a chip, an integrated circuit \nboard having chips thereon. I should have called it a module,  \n. . . . \nTaiwan is the People’s Republic of China, isn’t it?  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 2 of 40 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n (Id. at 26, 30.)  T hese statements, among others, led the  Court  to find  that the Quectel chip \nallegations and Emergency Motion were  brought in bad faith .  (Id. at 31–32.)  \nConsequently , the Court sanctioned Mr. Abhyanker.  ( Id.) \nThen, o n September 22, 2024, GovGPT filed its FAC , which added  Safariland as a \nDefendant  and regurgitated many of the allegations in the Initial Complaint.  (Doc. 74.)   \nSafariland has filed two Motions to Dismiss the FAC, one for lack of personal jurisdiction \nand the other for failure to state a claim.  (Doc. 110; Doc. 111.)  Axon and Microsoft also \nfiled new Motions to Dismiss for failure to state claim.  (Doc. 106; Do c. 90.)  \nOn December 20, 2024, GovGPT gave notice to the Court and Defendants of its \nintent to “Seek Motion before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to Consolidate \nand Transfer the Cases to One District ,” (Doc. 123 ; Doc. 124 ), and sought a stay pending \na panel decision (Doc. 144).  The Court denied issuing a stay.   (Doc. 144 .)  Defendants \nhave oppose d consolidating the case and have requested  expedite d consideration of the \npending Motions to Dismiss .  (Doc. 127; Doc. 131.)   This Order follows Defendant s’ \nrequest.  (Doc. 14 4.)  \nB. The FAC  \n1. The Parties  \nGovGPT is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in California.  \n(Doc. 74 ¶  4.)  It is an early -stage startup that develops and markets artificial intelligence \ntechnologies, such as 360 -degree body camera vests.  (Doc. 74 ¶  4.)  The company also \noffers a digital evidence management system  (“DEMS”) , hostable on “AWS, Microsoft, \nGoogle Cloud,  private storage,  or other vendors. ”  (Id. ¶ 25.)  It seeks to compete with \nAxon in the market for body -worn cameras  (“BWC s”) and DEMS.  ( See generally id. )  \nAlthough, GovGPT does not operate in the “Public Safety Video Integration and \nManagement Platforms ,” market but intends to compete directly with Axon at some \nundesignated future time.  ( Id. ¶ 25 n.2.)  \nDefendants in this case include Axon, Microsoft, and Safariland.  Axon is a publicly \ntraded Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business in Arizona.  ( Id. ¶ 5.)  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 3 of 40 \n- 4 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Axon designs, manufactures, and sells, among other things, BWCs  and DEMS.  ( Id.)  The \nFAC claims that  Axon supplies over 94% of American law enforcement agencies.  ( Id. ¶ \n2.)  Axon’s DEMS, Evidence.com, is an integrated software product that works in \nconjunction with Axon’s BWCs , including the AB4.  ( Id. ¶¶ 2, 109, 175.)  Microsoft is a \npublicly traded technology company incorporated in Washington and maintains \ndatacenters in El Mirage and Goodyear, Arizona.  ( Id. ¶ 6.)  The FAC  allege s that Axon \nexclusivel y uses Microsoft’s cloud platform, Microsoft Azure, to store footage uploaded \nto Axon’s Evidence.com platform .  (Doc. 13 ¶  5; Doc. 74 ¶  41.)  Safariland is a \nDelaware -organized limited liability company headquartered in Florida.  ( Doc. 74 ¶ 7.)  \nThe antitrust violations asserted against it in this case center around the 2018 sale  to Axon  \nof former  Safariland  subsidiary, VieVu, LLC (“VieVu”).  ( Id. ¶ 27.) \n2. The Claims  \nGovGPT asserts  the following claims for relief: (1) false advertising under the \nLanham Act; (2) violation of Section  7 of the Clayton Act; (3) conspiracy to retrain trade \nin violation of Section  1 of the Sherman Act; (4) monopolization in violation of Section  2 \nof the Sherman Act; (5) attempted monopolization in violation of Section  2 of the Sherman \nAct; (6) conspiracy to monopolize in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act; and (7) \nviolation of California Unfair Competition Law (the “UCL”) .  (See Doc. 74.)    \nFor the Lanham Act and UCL claims, GovGPT alleges that Axon makes several \nfalse or misleading statements on its “Responsibility” and “Principles” webpages.  ( See id. \n¶¶ 152–191, 310 –317.)  Regarding the antitrust claims , GovGPT alleges that Axon violated \nthe Clayton and Sherman Acts when it acquired Fusus, a real -time crime center (“RTCC”) \ncompany.  ( See Doc. 74 ¶¶  200–205, 267 –283.)  Similarly, GovGPT alleges that  both Axon \nand Safariland violated the Clayton and Sherman Acts when  Safariland sold VieV u to \nAxon.  ( See id. ¶¶ 192 –266, 284 –309.)  Additionally, GovGPT alleges that Axon and \nMicrosoft violated the Sherman Act by enter ing an anticompetitive cloud services \nagreement in 2018.  ( See id. ¶¶ 231 –248, 284–309.)   Axon ’s alleged violations are also \nbased on  the acquisitions and agreements having created a self -contained BWC and DEMS Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 4 of 40 \n- 5 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n ecosystem that prevents competitors from meaningfully participating the market.  ( See \ngenerally id. ) \nThe FAC also asserts many of the same claims regarding the Quectel “chips” but \nnow labels them “modules” and “components.”  ( See, e.g. , id. ¶¶ 53–55, 58, 61, 154 –157, \n213.)  These claims echo the same concern s about the Chinese Community Party being \nable to exploit  the Quectel “components” or “modules”  to compromise national security.   \n(See, e.g. , id ¶¶ 154 –157, 164, 167, 213, 265, 311.)  Like the Initial Complaint , the FAC \ndoes not  allege that GovGPT has tested the “components” or “modules.”  ( See id. )  Instead, \nGovGPT generally alleges that several congresspersons and persons testifying before \nCongress have noted the danger of Quectel IoT Modules  (See id.  ¶¶ 78–79), and that \nGovGPT  “warned” Axon about the danger of Quectel chips.  ( Id. ¶ 85.) \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Rule 12(b)(2)  \nPersonal jurisdiction refers to the power that a court has over the parties.  This \njurisdiction is proper when it is provided for by law and the exercise of jurisdiction \ncomports with due process.  Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 28 3 (2014).  “Federal courts \nordinarily follow state law in determining the bounds of their jurisdiction over persons.” \nDaimler AG v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117, 125 (2014).  Arizona has authorized its courts to \nexercise jurisdiction over persons “to the maximum extent permitted by  . . . the United \nStates Constitution.”  Ariz. R. Civ. P. 4.2(a).  \nDue process requires that a  defendant have at least “minimum contacts” with the \nforum state so that “maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play \nand substantial justice.”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. Wash ., 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)  (internal \nquotations omitted) .  “[T]he defendant’s conduct and connection with the forum State \n[must be] such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.”  \nWorld -Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson , 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980).  When analyzing  \nsufficient minimum contacts, courts distinguish between general jurisdiction and specific \njurisdiction.  General jurisdiction exists when the defendant has “continuous and Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 5 of 40 \n- 6 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n systematic” contacts with the forum state, whereas specific jurisdiction exists when the \ncontroversy arises from or is related to the defendant’s contact with the forum state.  See \nHelicopteros Nacionales de Colombia , S.A.  v. Hall , 466 U.S. 408, 414 –16 (1984).   The \ncourt “employ[s] a three -part test to assess whether a defendant has sufficient contacts with \nthe forum state ” to establish specific personal jurisdiction:  \n(1) The non -resident defendant must purposefully direct his activities or \nconsummate some transaction with the forum or resident thereof; or perform \nsome act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privilege of \nconducting activities in the forum, th ereby invoking the benefits and \nprotections of its laws;  \n(2) the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to the defendant’s \nforum -related activities; and  \n(3) the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play and substantial \njustice, i.e. it must be reasonable.  \nPicot v. Weston , 780 F.3d 1206, 1211 (9th Cir. 2015).   “The plaintiff bears the burden of \nsatisfying the first two prongs of the test.”  Schwarzenegger  v. Fred Martin Motor Co. , 374 \nF.3d 797, 802 (9th Cir. 2004) .  If the plaintiff satisfies the first two prongs, “the burden \nthen shifts to the defendant to ‘present a compelling case’ that the exercise of jurisdiction \nwould not be reasonable.”  Id. (quoting Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 4 62, \n477 (1985)).  \nB. Rule 12(b)(6)  \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim, a complaint must meet \nthe requirements of Rule 8(a)(2).  Rule 8(a)(2) requires a “short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” so that the defendant has “fair notice \nof what the  . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson , 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)).  This exists \nif the pleader sets forth “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged .”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported \nby mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id. \nDismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) “can be based on the lack of a cognizable legal theory Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 6 of 40 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n or the absence of sufficient facts alleged under a cognizable legal theory.”  Balistreri v. \nPacifica Police Dep’t , 901 F.2d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1988).  A complaint that sets forth a \ncognizable legal theory will survive a motion to dismiss if it contains sufficient factual \nmatter, which, if accepted as true, states a claim to relief that is “plausible on its face.”  \nIqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570).   Plausibility does not equal \n“probability,” but requires “more than a sheer possibilit y that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.”  Id.  “Where a complaint pleads facts that are ‘merely consistent with’ a \ndefendant’s liability, it ‘stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility .’”  Id. \n(quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 557).  \nIn ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the well -pled factual allegations are \ntaken as true and construed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Cousins v. \nLockyer , 568 F.3d 1063, 1067 (9th Cir. 2009).  However, legal conclusions couched as \nfactual allegations are not given a presumption of truthfulness, and “conclusory allegations \nof law and unwarranted inferences are not sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.”  Pareto \nv. FDIC , 139 F.3d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1998).  A court ordinarily  may not consider evidence \noutside the pleadings in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  See United States v. \nRitchie , 342 F.3d 903, 907 (9th Cir. 2003).  “A court may, however, consider \nmaterials —documents attached to the complaint, documents incorporated by reference in \nthe complaint, or matters of judicial notice —without converting the motion to dismiss into \na motion for summary judgment.”  Id. at 908.  \nC. Rule 9(b)  \nClaims sounding in fraud or mistake are subject to the heightened pleading \nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires that a plaintiff \nalleging fraud “must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.”   Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 9(b); see also Kearns v. Ford Motor Co. , 567 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir.  2009).  To \nsatisfy Rule 9(b), the allegations must be “specific enough to give defendants notice of the \nparticular misconduct which is alleged to constitute the fraud charged so that they can \ndefend against the charge and not just deny that they have done anything wrong.”  Semegen Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 7 of 40 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n v. Weidner , 780 F.2d 727, 731 (9th Cir.  1985).  Thus, claims sounding in fraud must allege \n“an account of the ‘time, place, and specific content of the false representations as well as \nthe identities of the parties to the misrepresentations.’”  Swartz v. KPMG LLP , 476 F.3d \n756, 764 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).   The plaintiff must set forth “what is false or \nmisleading about a statement, and why it is false.”  In re Glenfed, Inc. Sec. Litig. , 42 F.3d \n1541, 1548 (9th Cir.  1994) (en banc), superseded by statut e on other grounds as stated in \nRonconi v. Larkin , 253 F.3d 423, 429 n. 6 (9th Cir.2001).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Judicial Notice  \nIn ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court may consider “matters of judicial notice,” \nsee United States v. Ritchie , 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003), including information that \nis “generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or can be accurately and \nreadily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned,” Fed. \nR. Evid. 2 01(b); but see Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. \n2018) (“[A] court cannot take judicial notice of disputed fa cts contained in . . . public \nrecords.”).  Importantly, considering matters of judicial notice does not transmute a motion \nto dismiss into one for summary judgment.  See Ritchie , 342 F.3d at  908.  Moreover, a \ncourt should not accept as true “allegations that contradict matters properly subject to \njudicial notice,” nor “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of \nfact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th \nCir. 2008) (citation omitted).  Proper subjects of judicial notice include judgments and \nother court documents.  See, e.g. , United States v. Black , 482 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. \n2007); see also Khoja , 899 F.3d  at 999 (“Just because the document itself is susceptible to \njudicial notice does not mean that every assertion of fact within that document is judicially \nnoticeable for its truth.”).  \n GovGPT asks the Court to take judicial notice of an opinion issued in a case \ninvolving Axon’s acquisition of Vie Vu in the District Court of New Jersey.  (Doc. 145.)   \nSince the time of the request, the case  has been made available on Westlaw.  See In re Axon Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 8 of 40 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Vievu Antitrust Litig ., No. 23 -7182 (RK) (RLS), 2025 WL 366751, at *1 (D.N.J.  Jan. 31, \n2025).  Seeing no objection, the Court will grant  GovGPT’s Motion (Doc. 145)  and take \njudicial notice of the opinion . \nB. Safariland’s Motions to Dismiss (Doc. 110; Doc. 111)  \nIn its first Motion to Dismiss, Safariland  offers two arguments for why this Court \nlacks personal jurisdiction over it: (1) Section 12 of the Clayton Act does not apply to \nlimited liability companies (“LLCs”), like Safariland; and (2) Safariland lacks sufficient \nminimum contacts with Arizona.   (Doc. 110 at  6.)  Unsurprisingly, GovGPT  disagrees.  \n(See generally Doc. 117.)  \n1. Section 12 of the Clayton Act  \nSection 12 provides:  \nAny suit, action, or proceeding under the antitrust laws against a corporation \nmay be brought not only in the judicial district whereof it is an inhabitant, \nbut also in any district wherein it may be found or transacts business; and all \nprocess in such cas es may be served in the district of which it is an inhabitant, \nor wherever it may be found.  \n15 U.S.C. § 22.  With respect to corporations, the Ninth Circuit has held that “the \nworldwide service provision of [ Section] 12 justifies [the] conclusion that personal \njurisdiction may be established in any district, given the existence of sufficient national \ncontacts.”  Go-Video, Inc. v. Akai Elec. Co. , 885 F.2d 1406, 1415 (9th Cir. 1989).   Here, \nas with other cases, the parties’ fervently dispute whether Section 12 applies to LLCs .  By \nits plain  terms, the statute governs service upon “corporations.”  See 15 U.S.C. §  22.   \nFaced with whether Section 12  applied to a “voluntary association,” one district \ncourt reasoned:  \n“Persons, ” as defined in the Clayton Act, are “deemed to  include \ncorporations and associations ”; yet section 12 of the  same act, which \nauthorizes extraterritorial service, specifies  only “corporation. ” This \nspecificity necessarily excludes  individuals and voluntary associations from \nthose amenable  to extraterritorial service.  \nMcManus v. Tato , 184 F. Supp. 958 , 959  (S.D.N.Y. 1959) (cleaned up).  Safariland \ncontends that this reasoning  also applies to LLCs because Congress has not extended  \nSection 12 to unincorporated entities.  (Doc. 110 at  7.)  Th e Court agrees.  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 9 of 40 \n- 10 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  As Safariland points out, time and again  courts  have cabined  Section 12’s \napplicability to corporations.  See Cal . Clippers,  Inc. v. U.S. Soccer Football Ass’n , 314 F. \nSupp. 1057, 1061 (N.D. Cal. 1970) (“NASL is,  however, an unincorporated association, \nnot a corporation, so Clayton Act § 12 is [sic]  inapplicable  by its own terms to provide for \nservices of process against NASL in this  action.”); S.F. Comprehensive Tours, LLC v. \nTripadvisor, LLC , No.  2:20-CV-02117 -GMN -DJA, 2021 WL 4394253, at * 5 (D. Nev. \nSep. 24 2021) ( holding that Section 12 did not apply to defendant because it is an LLC ); \nShat Acres Highland Cattle, LLC, v. Am. Highland Cattle Ass’n , No. 21 -CV-1348 -WJM -\nSKC, 2023 WL 7089906, at *3 & n.3 (D.  Colo. Oct. 26, 2023) ( “Section [12], by its terms, \nonly applies to corporations .”); In re Chicken Antitrust Litig. , 407 F. Supp. 1285, 1299  (D. \nGa. 1975) ( holding that Section 12’s “transacting business” test was  inapplicable to a \npartnership); Kingsepp v. Wesleyan Univ. , 763 F. Supp.  22, 25 (S.D.N.Y 1991) (collecting \ncases) (“Given the narrow construction of the term  ‘corporation’ in section 12 and the \nreluctance of courts to extend nationwide service of  process under section 12 to \nnon-corporate defendants, it would be inappropriate to extend  section 12 to encompass a \ntrust . . . .”).  \n In response, GovGPT contends that the Supreme Court has recognized LLCs, \namong other entities, may fall with Section 12’s ambit when they act in concert with \ncorporations to suppress competition.  (Doc. 117 at  5 (citing Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, \nInc., 465 U.S. 770 (1984) ).)  In the same breath, however, GovGPT admits that its offered \nauthority is “not directly related to Section 12.”  ( Id.)  Indeed, Keeton  dealt with the \napplication of one state’s long arm state and the traditional minimum contacts analy sis to \nassert jurisdiction in a libel action.  465 U.S. at  770.  Despite offering no apposite authority, \nGovGPT posits that the Court ought to extend its jurisdiction based on “the functional \ninvolvement of entities in relevant conduct affecting the forum state.”  ( Doc. 117 at  5.)  \nThis approach not only comes before the Court without support, but also contravenes the \nwealth of well -reasoned, persuasive case law offered by Safariland.  Therefore, the Court \nrejects GovGPT’s arguments.  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 10 of 40 \n- 11 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  Based upon the statute’s plain language, and the supporting persuasive case law, \nthere is no question that Section 12 does not apply to Safariland.  As an LLC, and not a \ncorporation, it is not subject to the jurisdictional hook that 15 U.S.C. §  22 provide s.  \nTherefore, whether the Court has personal jurisdiction over Safariland must be determined \nthrough a traditional minimum contacts analysis.  \n2. Minimum Contacts  \nSafariland argues that this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it because (1) it \ndoes not have continuous or systematic contacts with Arizona; and (2) it does not \npurposefully direct activities at Arizona residents such that litigation would arise out of \nthose activities.  (Doc. 110 at  8–11.)  To support this argument, Safariland points out that \nit owns no property in Arizona, employs one remote employee in the state, and its sales in \nthe state are not related to BWCs or DEMS.  (Doc. 110 at  9–10.)  In  response, GovGPT \ncontends that Safariland’s sale of VieVu to Axon in 2018, coupled with extensive \nnon-compete agreements, satisfies minimum contacts such that the Court has jurisdiction \nover Safariland.  (Doc. 117 at  5–8.) \nThe traditional minimum contacts analysis requires the  Court to determine whether \nit has “general” or “specific” personal jurisdiction over Safariland.  See Bristol -Myers \nSquibb Co. v. Super. Ct. of Cal. , 582 U.S. 255, 262 (2017).   General jurisdiction exists over \nentities where its forum state “affiliations” are “so continuous and systematic as to render \n[it] essentially at home.”  Daimler , 571 U.S. at  139.  Generally, an entity is “at home” in \nits place of organization and its principal place of business .  Id. at 134.  Safariland is an \nLLC  organized in Delaware and headquartered in Florida.  (Doc. 74 ¶  7; Doc. 110 at  9.)  \nTherefore, under the traditional “at home” view, the Court would not have general \njurisdiction over Safariland.  See Daimler , 571 U.S. at  139.  Safariland further posits that \nthe Court lacks general jurisdiction over it because it owns no real property in Arizona, \nemploys a single remote employee in the state, and does not sell BWCs or DEMS in \nArizona .  (See Doc. 110 at  9; Doc. 110 -1 at 2 ¶¶ 6–9.)  GovGPT seemingly does not attempt \nto rebut this argument.  At bottom,  Court agrees that Safariland’s limited contacts with Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 11 of 40 \n- 12 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Arizona precludes finding that the Court possesses general personal jurisdiction over the \ncompany.  \nSpecific jurisdiction exists when an out -of-state defendant (1) purposefully directs \nhis activities at residents of the forum state, or purposefully avails himself of the privilege \nof conducting activities in the forum; (2) the asserted claim must be one arising out of the \ndefendant’s forum related activities; and (3) exercising jurisdiction must be reasonable.  \nPicot , 780 F.3d at 1211 .  GovGPT “ bears the burden of satisfying the first two prongs of \nthe test.”  See Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 802. \nRegarding prong one and two, GovGPT asserts that Safariland’s intentional act was \nselling  VieVu to Axon and executing  the related non -compete agreements.  (Doc. 117 \nat 5–6.)  According to GovGPT, Safariland knew that selling VieVu to Axon would “have \nsubstantial effects in Arizona.”  ( Id. at 6.)  Further, GovGPT contends that the Court “must \nlook beyond” Safariland’s incorporation and headquarters, and instead consider that \nSafariland holds a vested financial interest in Axon’s Arizona -based monopoly thr ough \nstock arrangements and Axon’s monopolistic pricing.  (Doc. 117 at  6–7.) \nGovGPT’s muddled allegations and argument misunderstand what “purposeful \ndirection” requires.   To show that Safariland purposefully directed its acts at Arizona, \nGovGPT must show that Safariland has “(1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly \naimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered \nin the forum state.”  Wash . Shoe Co. v. A -Z Sporting Goods, Inc. , 704 F.3d 668, 673 (9th \nCir. 2012).  The only relevant intentional act that GovGPT contends Safariland di rected at \nArizona was enter a contract to sell VieVu to Axon.  However, “a contract alone does not \nautomatically establish minimum contacts in the plaintiff ’s home forum.”  Boschetto v. \nHansing , 539 F.3d 1011, 1017  (9th Cir. 2008) .  Rather, there must be “actions by the \ndefendant himself that create a ‘substantial connection’ with the forum State.”  Burger \nKing , 471 U.S. at 475  (quoting McGee v. Int ’l Life Ins. , 355 U.S. 220, 223  (1957)) .  Further \nattenuating Safariland’s alleged contacts to Arizona is the argument that the sale of VieVu \nin 2018 was governed by Delaware law without reference to Arizona or its laws.  ( See Doc. Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 12 of 40 \n- 13 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 110 at  11.)  To be sure, as Safariland contends, that transaction involved Safariland, \nDelaware -organized LLC headquartered in Florida, selling VieVu, a \nWashington -organized LLC headquartered in Washington, to Axon, a Delaware -organized \ncorporation headquartered in Arizona.  ( Id.)  Thus, to some degree, Arizona is implicated \nin the sale of VieVu.  However, given the specific facts of this case show that the sale was \nnot purposefully directed at the forum state, nor did Safariland avail itself of Arizona  law \nto affect the transaction.   (See id.) \nThe remainder of GovGPT’s argument is seemingly directed at the fallout from the \nsale of VieVu to Axon.  ( See, e.g. , Doc. 117 at  6 ¶ 13.)  Whether the sale VieVu impacted \n“Arizona’s law enforcement agencies and GovGPT” is not the standard.  Rather, GovGPT \nmust show that Safariland undertook an “external manifestation of  [will]” to direct actions \nat Arizona without rely ing on such act’s “results, even the most direct, immediate, and \nintended.”  Morill v. Scott Fin. Corp. , 873 F.3d 1136, 1142 (9th Cir. 2017).   To affect the \nforum state is not  always  enough, there must be a showing of an intentional act expressly \naimed at it.  Washington Shoe , 704 F.3d at  673.  As Safariland puts it, GovGPT must show \nmore than the alleged effects that the sale of VieVu had on the location of the ultimate \npurchaser —Axon.  (Doc. 12 at  5); see also Helicopteros Nacionales de  Colombia , 466 \nU.S. at 417 (“ [The] u nilateral activity of another party or a third person is not an appropriate \nconsideration when determining whether a defend ant has sufficient contacts with a forum \nState to justify an assertion of jurisdiction.”) . \nTherefore, the Court finds that GovGPT has failed to carry its burden to show that \nSafariland (1) purposefully directs its activities at Arizona; and (2) that the asserted claim \narose from Safariland’s forum related activities.  See Picot , 780 F.3d at 1211 .  As a result, \nSafariland lacks the minimum contacts required for this Court to have personal jurisdiction \nover it.1  Therefore, the Court will grant Safariland’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 110) and \n \n1  The FAC alleges that Safariland’s contacts arise from substantial business in this district, \nincluding the sale of BWCs.  (Doc. 74 ¶  22.)  In response, Safariland provided an affidavit  \nfrom its Vice President of Legal and Compliance, who averred that Safariland does not \nmake sales for BWCs or DEMS in Arizona , casting doubt on the plausibility of GovGPT’s \nallegation .  (Doc. 110 -1 at 2 ¶ 9.)  GovGPT does not engage with its own allegation or the \naffidavit in its Response, and instead directs its argument at Safariland’s sale of VieVu to Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 13 of 40 \n- 14 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n dismiss it from this case with prejudice.   With this dismissal, Safariland’s other Motion to \nDismiss (Doc. 111) is now moot .  Therefore, the Court will deny that Motion (Doc. 111).  \nC. Microsoft’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 90)  \nMicrosoft argues that GovGPT’s FAC must be dismissed because: (1) the claims \nare time barred; (2) GovGPT  has not pleaded an antitrust injury and therefore lacks \nstanding; and (3) the FAC does not plausibly allege an unlawful agreement.2  (Doc. 90 \nat 6–7.)  For the reasons set forth, the Court agrees with Microsoft.  \n1. The Statute of Limitations and Antitrust Standing  \nUnder federal antitrust laws, an action must be commenced within four years after \nthe cause of action accrues.  See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Rsch., Inc. , 401 U.S. 321, \n338 (1971); see also In  re Animation Workers Antitrust Litig. , 87 F. Supp. 3d 1195, 12 11 \n(N.D. Cal. 2015) (dismissing antitrust claims as time barred).  “A cause of action in \nantitrust accrues each time a plaintiff is injured by an act of the defendant and the statute \nof limitations runs from the commission of the act.”  See Pace Indus., Inc. v. Three Phx . \nCo., 813 F.2d 234, 237 (9th Cir. 1987) (citation omitted).   A plaintiff may plead that a \ndefendant’s acts constitute a continuing violation, in which case allegations of “an ov ert \nact by the defendant is required to restart the statute of limitations and the statute runs from \nthe last overt act.”  Id.; see also Klehr v. A.O. Smith Corp. , 521 U.S. 179, 189 (1997).   \nHere, GovGPT  alleges that Microsoft injured it by entering into an unlawful \nagreement with Axon in 2018, which was then extended in 2022 (the “2022 Extension”).  \n(Doc. 74 ¶¶  26–27, 40, 44, 208 –212.)  Because GovGPT’s claims accrued when Microsoft \nand Axon executed the 2018 agreement, the inquiry becomes whether the 2022 Extension \nwas a continuing violation.  See Pace Indus tries, 813 F.2d at  237. \nCourts in the Ninth Circuit have explained that pleading a continuing violation \n \nAxon.  ( See Doc. 117.)   The Court, therefore, finds that GovGPT has conceded the \nallegation regarding Safariland’s sale of BWCs in Arizona.  See Morgan v. Kalaco \nScientific, Inc. , No. CV -07-0786 -PHX -SRB, 2008 WL 11449239, at *2 (D. Ariz. Mar. 5, \n2008) (“ Generally, where a party fails to respond to a non -frivolous legal argument raised \nby opposing counsel in a dispositive motion, that argument is deemed conceded. ”). \n2  Microsoft also moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s Clayton Act claim.  Plaintiff states that it has \nnot alleged such a claim against Microsoft.  (Doc. 94 at  10.)  Therefore, the Court will not \naddress the parties’ arguments on the Clayton Act claim.  Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 14 of 40 \n- 15 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n requires more than “bald assertion[s]” that a defendant adhered to, enforced, and reaffirmed \nthe alleged anticompetitive agreements.  See, e.g. , Garrison v. Oracle Corp. , 159 F. Supp. \n3d 1044, 1070 –71 (N.D. Cal. 2016); Ryan v. Microsoft Corp. , 147 F. Supp. 3d 868, 884 \n(N.D. Cal. 2015) (finding allegations that defendant had non -solicitation agreements it \n“maintained and renewed” to be “insufficient to quality for the continuing violation \ndoctrine”).  For a continuing violation to restart the limitations p eriod, GovGPT must plead \nan overt act that (1) “[is] a new and independent act that is not merely a reaffirmation of a \nprevious act”; and (2) “[the overt act] must inflict [a] new and accumulating injury on the \nplaintiff.”  See Pace Indus. , 813 F.2d at  238. \nGovGPT ’s allegations regarding the 2022 Extension are inconsistent and difficult \nto follow.  For example, it alleges that the 2022 Extension “grant[ed] Microsoft continued \nexclusive access to the extensive law enforcement data.”  (Doc. 74 ¶  208.)  And “[t]hrough \nthe 2022 extension, Microsoft maintained  exclusive control over Axon’s body camera \ndata,” (Doc. 74 ¶  209), which “enabled Microsoft to monopolize AI development  . . . by \nproviding it with unparallelled access to data that competitors could not obtai n, (Id. ¶ 210).  \nThen, however, GovGPT seemingly asserts that only after the 2022 Extension did the \nagreement require Axon’s Evidence.com platform “to work exclusively with Microsoft \nAzure.”  ( Id. ¶ 41.)  In his Response  to the Motion , GovGPT explains that the 2022 \nExtension “included new terms granting Microsoft ongoing  exclusive access to Axon’s \nbody camera data and related AI technologies.”  (Doc. 94 at  3 (emphasis added).); cf. \nSamsung Elecs. Co. v. Panasonic Corp. , 747 F.3d 1199, 1204 (9th Cir. 2014) ( expanding \na license agreement in 2006 to include products not covered by the previous 2003 license \nagreement was an overt act because the “2003 license did not contemplate future \nexpansion”).  \nOn one hand, GovGPT seems to  allege that Microsoft and Axon extended, \nmaintained, and reinforced its existing agreement, which would not amount to an overt act.  \nSee Pace Indus tries, 813 F.2d at  238.  On the other, GovGPT’s  allegations suggest that the \n2022 Extension added “exclusivity” terms that were not part of the 2018 cloud storage Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 15 of 40 \n- 16 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n contract, including a term that “requires [Axon’s] Evidence.com platform to work \nexclusively with Microsoft Azure.”  (Doc. 74 ¶ 41; see also id. ¶¶ 40, 42, 44.)  However, \nGovGPT has not expressly pleaded what terms in the 2022 Extension are “new” to satisfy \nthe continuing violation requirement of a new and independent act that inflicts a new and \naccumulating injury.  See Ryan 147 F. Supp. 3d at  884 (“[W]here the defendant entered \ninto an allegedly unlawful contract prior to the limitations period, the defe ndant still must \ntake an unlawful new and independent act that is not merely a reaffirmation of a previous \nact during the limitations period.” (quotation marks omitted)).  And, reading the allegations \nin the light most favorable to GovGPT , the Court cannot determine what aspect of any \ncognizable “new” allegations materially changed the agreement such that the 2022 \nExtension was an overt act by Microsoft.  See id.  \n GovGPT does draw the Court’s attention to the following allegation, which it \nbelieves shows an overt act:  \nMicrosoft has been known to offer better pricing and incentives, like cloud \ncredits, to entice companies to move more data to Azure. Microsoft ’s \npreferential  pricing strategy, such as offering $500 million in Azure credits \nexclusively to OpenAI, gives preferential pricing or better terms to select \npartners. Upon information and belief, this preferential pricing was extended \nto Axon.  \n(Doc. 74 ¶  40; Doc. 94 at  3–4.)  According to GovGPT , Microsoft’s pricing strategy \n“reinforced the barriers to entry for competitors,” and has ostensibly cost GovGPT \nopportunities and profit.  (Doc. 94 at  4.)  Even assuming that this allegation is true, it has \nnothing to do with the 2022 Extension that GovGPT so fervently believes reset the statute \nof limitations.   And, as Microsoft has pointed out, offering discounts or incentives  \ngenerally cannot support a separate antitrust claim.  (Doc. 90 at  18 (citin g Brooke Grp. Ltd. \nv. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , 509 U.S. 209, 223 –24 (1993) (analyzing a \npredatory pricing claim under §  2 of the Sherman Act requires showing “prices complained \nof are below an appropriate measure of its rival’s costs  . . . . [And] demonstrat[ing] that the \ncompetitor had a reasonable prospect  . . . of re couping its investment in below -cost \nprices”).  As it stands, Plaintiff has done no more than allege that Microsoft use s an \neffective pricing model to entice business es to use its Azure cloud service rather than Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 16 of 40 \n- 17 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n competing  services.   Thus , GovGPT has failed to plead  an overt act.  See, e.g. , Garrison , \n159 F. Supp. 3d at  1070 –71; Ryan , 147 F. Supp. 3d at  884. \nEven if GovGPT had pleaded a new and individual act, the FAC fails to allege that \nsuch an act caused a cognizable antitrust injury.  Antitrust laws were designed to redress \ninjuries suffered by plaintiffs “injur[ed] in the market where competition is being \nrestrained.”  Am. Ad Mgmt., Inc. v. Gen. Tele. Co. of Cal. , 190 F.3d 1051, 1057 (9th Cir. \n1999) (“As a broker for the advertisements whose prices are allegedly retrained, [plaintiff] \nis a participant in the relevant market and it has suffered an injury in that market, the loss \nof commissions on advertisement purcha ses.”).3  In other words, the injured party “must \nbe a participant in the same market as the alleged malefactors.”  In re Dynamic Access \nMemory (DRAM) Antitrust Litig. (“DRAM II ”), 536 F. Supp. 2d 1129, 1137 (N.D. Cal. \n2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nHere, GovGPT alleges that the relevant market is “body -worn cameras, digital \nevidence management systems, and public safety video integration and management \nplatforms.”  (Doc. 74 ¶¶  125–28.)  Somewhat troubling, however, is GovGPT’s contention \nthat it “intends  to enter and compete in the digital evidence management market,” (Doc. 94 \nat 10), which calls into question the veracity of its market allegations, ( see Doc. 74  \n¶¶ 125–128.)  If GovGPT has not entered the market, claims that it was injured in such \nmarket are merely speculative, which does not suffice to show injury for an antitrust claim \nor standing purposes.  See DRAM II , 536 F. Supp. 2d at  1137;  Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l \nUSA, 568 U.S. 398, 414 (2013) (finding that a “speculative chain of possibilities” cannot \nestablish an actual or imminent injury in fact); see also City of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders , \n20 F.4th 441, 458 (9th Cir. 2021) (“The harm may not  be derivative and indirect or \nsecondary, consequential, or remote.” (quotation marks omitted)).  T hat concern aside, \nconspicuously absent from the FAC are any allegations of the market in which Microsoft \ncompetes.  ( See generally id. )  Thus, on its face, the FAC does not set forth any allegation \n \n3  An antitrust injury has four requirements: (1) unlawful conduct, (2) causing an injury to \nthe plaintiff, (3) that flows from that which makes the conduct unlawful, and (4) that is of \nthe type that antitrust laws were intended to prevent.  Id.at 1055 –57. \n Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 17 of 40 \n- 36 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n competition for them.”).   Although , the Ninth Circuit has found that a competitor who may \ngain from a defendant ’s alleged anticompetitive conduct is not completely precluded from \nshowing an  antitrust injury . Cf. Ellis v. Salt River Proj. Improvement and Power Dist. , 24 \nF.4th 1262,  1274 –75 (9th Cir. 2022).  Although, the Ninth Circuit’s finding  does not \nchange the fact that the plaintiff must plead  a cognizable injury, it may not, as GovGPT \nhas done here, cobble together a mix of consumer, competitor, and conspiracy -based injury \nallegations  related to an acquisition , and hope that the Court pieces the puzzle together.  See \nAtl. Richfield , 495 U.S. at  334. \nGovGPT’s allegations of high barriers to market entry are similarly insufficient.  \n(Doc. 74 ¶  198.)  Aside from declaring that Axon’s anticompetitive  conduct made it \n“infeasible for a competitor” to enter the market, GovGPT provides no factual \nenhancement to demonstrate  that it has been  foreclosed  or impeded  from the opportunity \nof competing in the relevant product market  because of the VieVu acquisition .  (See \ngenerally id. ); cf. Novation Ventures , 156 F. Supp. 3d at  1102 .  Again, the law requires \nGovGPT to  demonstrate that it has suffered an injury the antitrust laws were designed to \nprevent, which requires more than regurgitating the elements in myriad  allegations.  ( See \nDoc. 74 ¶¶  198, 205.)  \nGovGPT also alleges that the acquisition restrained trade because “conceal[ed] \ncritical information about the security vulnerabilities  . . . [of] Quectel modules, and thereby \nmisleading [customers] into buying Axon products.”  ( Id. ¶ 213); Glen Holly En t., 352 F.3d \nat 374  (explaining that antitrust injury may result from “ [c]oercive activity that prevents its \nvictims from making free choices between market alternatives.” )  According to GovGPT, \nbut for Axon’s deception, law enforcement agencies would have bought from c ompeting \nfirms, and this failure to disclose “has distorted the competitive landscape . . . at the expense \nof competitors like Plaintiff.”  ( Id.)  This allegation, however, does not stand up to even \nmodest scrutiny.  First, the procedural history of this case casts some doubt on the \nplausibility of GovGPT’s allegations regarding the Quectel “chips,” “components,” or \n“modules.”  ( See Doc. 7 1; Doc. 105.)  Second, GovGPT’s FAC is unclear as to whether it Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 36 of 40 \n- 37 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n is even a competitor.  ( See Doc. 74 ¶¶  88, 133,  163, 177, 202.)  Third, GovGPT alleges no \nmore than bald conclusions that the presence of the Quectel parts actually  led to it losing \nbusiness.  ( See id. ¶ 213.)  And fourth , the link between the acquisition of VieVu, the \nQuectel parts, and GovGPT’s alleged injury is tenuous and nearly incomprehensible.   (See \nid.)  In other words, the FAC not only fails to allege an antitrust injury  for a Section 7 \nclaim , but also fails to comply with the fundamental requireme nt of Rule 8: “a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2).   The facts alleged concerning the Quectel parts  do little to enhance GovGPT’s  \ngeneralized allegations of “substantially lessened competition” and “monopolization. ” \nInterestingly included in the Section 7 allegations is the following: “Plaintiff have \n[sic] been injured and have [sic] paid artificially inflated prices for the Products.”  ( Doc. \n74 ¶¶ 228, 233, 253, 261 .)  The same  or similar  allegations of injury are present in Counts \nIII and VI as well.  The FAC is having an identity crisis, as it has failed to the draw the line \nbetween consumer -based injury and competitor -based injury.  GovGPT’s has not pleaded \nan antitrust injury that would confer standing upon it for a Section 7 Clayton Act claim.  \nGovGPT similarly fails to plead an antitrust injury for its Sherman Act claims.  In \nCount III, which alleges a conspiracy to restrain trade, GovGPT contends that Axon entered \ninto several agreement s with Safariland and Microsoft that have reduced competition in \nviolation of Section 1.  (Doc. 74 ¶ 233.)  GovGPT does not plead specific allegations \nregarding the conspiracy to restrain trade as it relates to the VieVu Acquisition.  (See id. )  \nInstead, this  section is largely directed at Axon and Microsoft’s agr eements and hosting of \nbodycam footage.  ( See id.  ¶¶ 231 –248.)  The Court has previously explained that  the \nstatute of limitations bars GovGPT’s  antitrust claims based on the 2018 Microsoft \nagreement.   Additionally, as alleged, it is unclear how the agreements with Safariland \nestablish an injury, as the non -compete provisions have been rescinded.  ( Id. ¶¶ 134, 233 .) \nTo the extent that the injury is premised on the Quectel modules, GovGPT’s claim \nis no more successful.  As explained, those allegations lack plausibility  and factual \nenhancement, making them  at most, an attempt to further support an already rejected Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 37 of 40 \n- 38 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n conspiracy theory about the AB4.  Unfortunately, the  allegations in Count III, like most of \nthe FAC, is rife with ultimate, conclusory facts about GovGPT’s alleged  injurie s.  (See, \ne.g., id.  ¶ 238 (“Defendants’ conduct has caused Plaintiff to suffer damages in the form of \ninjuries to their business or property.).)  \nCount IV, which alleges monopolization of the BWC and DEMS markets, GovGPT \ncontends that the VieVu acquisition has resulted in “substantial anticompetitive effects” \nsuch as higher prices in the product markets and injured competition.  (Doc. 74 ¶ 253.)  \nGovGPT goes on to allege that Axon’s conduct has caused it to suffer i njuries to its \nbusiness and property  due to the acquisition and  because of “Axon’s deliberate \nconcealment of the security risks associated with the Quectel Modules . . . mislead \n[consumers ] into adopting Axon’s technology.”  ( Id. ¶ 265.)  Like the preceding Counts, \nthe FAC lacks any factual enhancement to show how the VieVu Acquisition resulted in \ninjurious conduct that has or will injure GovGPT.  ( See id. )  Instead, GovGPT peddles its \nconspiracy theory about the potential danger of Quectel modules and Axon’s deceptive \nsales practices.  ( Id.) \n Similarly, Count VI, which alleges conspiracy to monopolize, does not set forth how \nAxon’s illegal conduct related to the VieVu Acquisition injured GovGPT as a competitor.7  \n(See id. ¶¶ 284–309.)  Even if GovGPT successfully established standing for this claim, it \nwould otherwise fail because it is premised upon a “dual monopoly” theory, upon which a \nSection 2 claim cannot be based.  See Standfacts Credit Serv’s Inc. v. Experian Info. Sol., \nInc., 405 F. Supp. 2d 1141, 1152 –53 (C.D. Cal. 2005) (“[A]n allegation of conspiracy to \ncreate a shared monopoly does not plead a claim of conspiracy under section 2.”); (Doc. \n74 ¶  292 (“[T]he collaboration between Microsoft and Axon establ ished a dual \nmonopoly.”) .) \n Earlier, the Court afforded GovGPT Lanham Act claim some analysis after finding \nthat it lacked standing to bring it.  The same benefit will not be afforded to GovGPT \n \n7 In Count VI, GovGPT contends that competitors are unable to compete in part because \nAxon will not provide competitors with footage from its Evidence.com repository.  ( Id. \n¶ 288.)  Or in other words, GovGPT’s claim is partly based on its issue with the fact that, \nwithout a court order, it cannot utilize Axon’s work for its own gain.  ( See id. ) Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 38 of 40 \n- 39 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n regarding its antitrust cl aims, as the FAC and its Response to Axon’s Motion are near \nindecipherable regarding these claims.   GovGPT has consistently misrepresented and \nattempted to rewrite the allegations in its FAC and the precedent upon which it relies.   (See, \ne.g., Doc. 121 at  22 (citing In re Lithium Ion Batteries Antitrust Litigation , \nNo.:13 -MD-2420 YGR, 2024 WL 309192 , at *1 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 21, 2014) ).)   \nOn its face , the FAC is confusing, inconsistent, and as a result, fail s to properly \nplead antitrust injury.  Similarly, the FAC  fails to state a claim for relief under the Lanham \nAct or the UCL.  Consequently, the entire FAC will be dismissed without prejudice as to \nAxon . \nIV. LEAVE TO AMEND  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) requires that leave to amend be “freely give[n] \nwhen justice so requires.”  Leave to amend should not be denied unless “the proposed \namendment either lacks merit or would not serve any purpose because to grant it would  be \nfutile in saving the plaintiff’s suit.”  Universal Mortg. Co. v. Prudential Ins. Co. , 799 F.2d \n458, 459 (9th Cir. 1986).  Therefore, “a district court should grant leave to amend even if \nno request to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines t hat the pleading could \nnot possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, \n1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (cleaned up).  \nHere, GovGPT filed an Initial Complaint, a Proposed Amended Complaint (Doc. \n69) which it later withdrew, and now the FAC (Doc. 74).  Each iteration of the Complaint \nin this case has asserted similar claims, including those claims regarding the potential \ndanger of Quectel “chips,” “components,” or “modules.”   (See Doc. 1; Doc. 69; Doc. 74.)   \nAxon contends that the FAC ought to be dismissed with prejudice because GovGPT has \nhad ample opportunities to cure its deficient allegations and has failed to do so.  (D oc. 106 \nat 32 (citing McHenry v. Renne , 84 F.3d 1172 (9th Cir. 1996)).)  \nThe Court agrees that GovGPT’s FAC fails to state a claim, but it does not believe \nthat all claims in this case should be dismissed with prejudice at this time.   Although the \nCourt can say with certainty that GovGPT has not buried a cognizable claim somewhere Case 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 39 of 40 \n- 40 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n in his 110 -page FAC.  Indeed, the FAC is so long, dense, and inconsistent that GovGPT’s \nclaims often collapse in on themselves.   That notwithstanding, the Court will allow \nGovGPT an additional attempt at amendment.  However, the Court warns GovGPT that its \nSecond Amended Complaint must comply with Rule 8(a).  The Court will not pronounce \na hard -and-fast page limit, but the Court notes that 110 -pages is excessive in a case wherein \na great deal of the alleged facts more to do with supporting a conspiracy theory than \nsubstantiating Lanham Act or antitrust claim s.  It is not lost on the Court that the very \nnature of antitrust actions typically begets a detailed complaint.  However, pleadings in \nsuch cases ought to (1) avoid alleging  a horde of irrelevant, conspiratorial facts; and (2) \ncomport with the requirements that pleadings in federal court be “short and plain.”   See \nFed. R. Civ. P. (8)(a)(2).   Failure to comply with this directive will result in  the dismissal \nof GovGPT’s amended pleading.   If GovGPT wishes to have another bite at the apple, it \nwill file a Second Amended Complaint within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED  granting Safariland’s Motion to Dismiss for Lack of \nPersonal Jurisdiction (Doc. 110) and denying as moot Safariland’s Motion to Dismiss for \nFailure to State a Claim (Doc. 111).  Because the Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over \nSafariland, it will be dismissed from this case with prejudice.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  granting Microsoft’s Motion to Dismiss  (Doc. 90)  \nand dismissing Microsoft from this case without prejudice.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  granting Axon’s Motion to Dismiss (Doc. 106) and \ndismissing Axon from this case without prejudice.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED instructing GovGPT that if it wishes to file a \nSecond Amended Complaint, it must do so within thirty (30) days of the date of this Order.  \n Dated this 7th day of March, 2025.  \n \n \nCase 2:24-cv-01869-SMB     Document 146     Filed 03/07/25     Page 40 of 40",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves privacy claims against Flo Health, Meta Platforms, and Google, where plaintiffs allege that the Flo Period and Ovulation Tracker app unlawfully shared users' sensitive health data with Meta and Google, despite privacy assurances. The class certification was granted, for the most part, determining that common questions about the alleged AI-driven data sharing practices, informed consent, contractual limitations, and waiver unconscionability can be resolved on a class-wide basis. AI and automated systems are central in how the Flo app reportedly used SDKs to share menstrual and pregnancy data with Meta and Google for commercial gain.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Flo app users gave implied consent for their sensitive health data to be shared with third parties such as Meta and Google, and whether this data sharing breached privacy commitments.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court certified both a nationwide class and a California subclass, allowing class action claims for privacy violations, breach of contract, and invasion of privacy to proceed against Flo, with related claims against Meta and Google under California's Invasion of Privacy Act. The class action waiver in Flo's terms of service was found to be unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A group of people who used a period-tracking app sued the app company and two big tech companies because they shared private info about users’ health, like period dates, without telling the users. The court said these users can band together to sue because everyone was affected the same way. The court also decided that a rule in the app's user agreement saying users couldn’t sue as a group was not fair because it was hidden in the fine print. This means the lawsuit can continue as a class action, where lots of users work together to make their case against these companies.",

(Flo), Google LLC, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (Meta)1 in connection \nwith the Flo Period and Ovulation Tracker app for women (Flo App).  They say that, from 2016 to \n2019, the Flo App surreptitiously transmitted users’ highly personal information about \nmenstruation, ovulation, pregnancy goals, and the like to Google and Meta through their software -\ndevelopment kits (SDKs), despite assurances to the contrary by Flo.  See generally  Dkt. No. 64 \n(consolidated amended complaint or CAC).  Plaintiffs allege that defendants commercially \nexploited users’ sensitive health information, namely for marketing and advertising purposes.  \nId. ¶¶ 99, 105, 125, 128, 128 n.19, 141, 149, 182.   \nPlaintiffs filed a request to certify classes of Flo App users for damages and injunctive \nrelief.  Dkt. No. 477.  Defendants oppose d certification of any class .  Dkt. No. 491.  The \nsubmissions by both sides were massive  and totaled just under 1,000 pages in all.  Dkt. Nos. 477 -\n79, 490 -91, 496 -98.  The brief filed by defendants was not a triumph of clarity and organization.  \n \n1  The complaint names “Facebook, Inc.” as a defendant, but Meta is the current corporate name, \nwhich will be used here.

Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 1 of 35 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendants did not address the element s required by Rule 23(a), and  often did not support their \narguments with useful analysis .  The Court has undertaken the arduous  work of bringing order to \nthe question of certification , which has resulted in an atypically long order.   \nOverall, p laintiffs have adduced substantial evidence demonstrating that the proposed class \nmembers saw the same privacy representations by Flo, experienced the same Flo App and SDK \npractices, and have the same alleged claims and injuries.  The questions posed in plaintiffs ’ case  \ncan be answered on the basis of common evidence that applies on a classwide  basis .  \nConsequently, c ertification is granted in main part , with a few specific, claim -related exceptions .   \nBACKGROUND  \nI. THE ALLEGATIONS  \nThe named plaintiffs are eight women  in the states of California, New Jersey, New York, \nOhio, and Pennsylvania , who downloaded and used the Flo App between 2017 and 2019.2  Dkt. \nNo. 64  ¶¶ 35-90.  The Flo App is said to have been  “the first mobile application to make use of \nartificial intelligence to accurately predict reproductive cycles” and was marketed as a sexual \nhealth and wellness app.  Id. ¶¶ 115 -21.  The app coache d users to input a wide variety of personal \ndata, such as the “timing of the user’s menstrual cycle,” “preferred birth control methods,” and \ndetails about users’ “sexual activity.”  Id. ¶¶ 131-33.  Plaintiffs sa id that f rom its launch to the end \nof December 2020, the Flo App was “rated the #1 period tracker in the United  States .  . . and the \n#1 most downloaded health app in the Apple App Store.”  Id. ¶ 121. \nPlaintiffs allege that, between 2017 and 2019, Flo made representations to users that it \nwould keep their personal information private and confidential.   Dkt. No. 64  ¶ 136.  For example , \nFlo’s 2017 -18 privacy policy stated that Flo “may share certain” information with third parties \n“that is reasonably necessary to perform their work ,” such as  “supply[ing] software applications, \nweb hosting, and other technologies ,” but would  “exclud[ e] information regarding your marked \ncycles, pregnancy, symptoms, notes and  other information that is entered by you and that you do \nnot elect to share.”  Id. ¶¶ 164-65 (first alteration in original).  Flo also represented that third \n \n2  Plaintiffs Wellman, Chen, and Gamino are residents of California.  Dkt. No.  64 ¶¶ 42, 56, 63 . Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 2 of 35 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  parties “could not use Flo App users’  personal  information ‘for any other purpose except to \nprovide services in connection with the App.’”  Id. ¶ 166.  Similar assurances were alleged  to have \nbeen made in the 2018 -19 privacy policy.  Id. ¶¶ 167-68, 177.   \nIn plaintiffs’ telling, these assurances were false.  They say Flo integrated Meta and \nGoogle’s SDKs into the Flo App to obtain personal information  shared by users.  Dkt. No. 64  \n¶ 140.  The SDKs collected two categories of information: “Standard Events” and “Custom \nEvents.”   Standard Events consist ed of “routine app functions, such as launching or closing the \napp,” while Custom Events were  “records of user -app interactions unique to the app itself.”  Id. \n¶ 137.  Flo design ed and name d the specific Custom Events used in the Flo App.  Id. ¶ 139.  The \nCustom Events  were  said to have convey ed personal  health information by virtue of Flo’s naming \nconventions  (e.g., Flo gave them titles such as “‘R_PREGNANCY_WEEK_CHOSEN’ rather than \nsomething generic, like ‘Event 1’”), and were  transmitted by the SDKs to Google and Meta.  Id. \n¶¶ 137, 140 -46.  Plaintiffs allege  that the SDKs transmitted “critical pieces of data from [users’] \nmobile devices, including ‘persistent identifiers,’” which were “unique data points .  . . that can \nlink one specific individual to all the apps on her device and her activity on those apps, allowing \nher to be tracked over time and across devices.”  Id. ¶ 151.  Plaintiffs say that, notwithstanding \nFlo’s representations  to users , Meta and Google used the collected d ata for commercial purposes \nbeyond providing analytics to Flo.  Id. ¶ 149.   \nII. THE LITIGATION  \nPlaintiff Frasco filed the original complaint in this case on behalf of herself and others \nsimilarly situated.  Dkt. No. 1.  The Court consolidated several related cases and subsequently \nappointed co-lead counsel for the putative class on an interim basis .  Dkt. Nos. 59, 80.  The \noperative complaint is the consolidate d amended  complaint, and it allege d claims against Flo, \nGoogle, Meta, and two other defendants, AppsFlyer, Inc. and Flurry, Inc.  Dkt. No. 64.  After the \nCourt dismissed the complaint  in part  with leave to amend, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their \nclaims against AppsFlyer.  Dkt. Nos. 158, 171.   \nAfter substantial discovery and motion practice, plaintiffs moved to certify four classes of \nFlo App users.  Dkt. No. 330.  The motion was terminated after the Court directed the parties to Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 3 of 35 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  address the bloated number of expert witnesses proffered by the parties and the result ing plethora \nof motions to exclude those witnesses under Federal Rule of Evidence 702.  See Dkt. Nos. 330, \n381, 383, 385, 389, 392, 394, 395, 403, 419.  Google moved for summary judgment on the claims \nagainst it , Dkt. No. 338 , and t he Court granted summary judgment to Google for  plaintiffs’ UCL \nand aiding -and-abetting claims , but denied Google’s  request in all other respects.  Dkt. No. 485.  \nPlaintiffs have renewed their motion for class certification.3  Dkt. No. 477.  They now ask \nfor certification of a nationwide class and a California subclass , as follows:   \nNationwide Class :  All Flo App users who entered menstruation \nand/or pregnancy information into the Flo Health App between \nNovember 1, 2016, and February 28, 2019, inclusive.  \nCalifornia Subclass :  All Flo App users in California who entered \nmenstruation and/or pregnancy information into the Flo Health App \nwhile residing in California between November 1, 2016, and \nFebruary 28, 2019, inclusive.  \nThe nationwide class is proposed for  certification under Rule 23(b)(3) for damages against \ndefendant Flo  for: (1) violation of the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act \n(CMIA); (2)  breach of contract (or in the alternative breach of an implied contract); (3)  common \nlaw invasion of privacy (intrusion upon seclusion); and (4)  violation of the Compr ehensive \nComputer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA).  The same class is proposed for damages against \ndefendants Meta and Google  for violation s of CDAFA.   Certification of t he California subclass is \nalso proposed under Rule 23(b)(3) for damages against Flo  for invasion of privacy in violation of \nArt. 1, Sec.  1 of the California Constitution, and against Meta and Google  for violation s of the \nCalifornia Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA).  \nIn addition to the damages classes, plaintiffs propose certification  of the nationwide class \nand California subclass under Rule 23(b)(2).  The nationwide class would seek injunctive relief in \n \n3  Following the termination of all FRE 702 motions in connection with the first round of \ncertification briefing, Dkt. No. 419, the parties designated a more limited number of experts and \ndid not renew their FRE 702 challenges.  See Dkt. Nos. 425 -26.  There are consequently no \npending  FRE 702  challenges to any expert evidence proffered in connection with the present \ncertification request . Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 4 of 35 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  connection with the  CDAFA and common law invasion of privacy claims, and the California \nsubclass would seek injunctive relief in connection with their CIPA claims.  \nThe three California plaintiffs (Wellman, Chen, and Gamino) are proposed to be the \nrepresentatives for the California subclass es.  Th e same  three plaintiffs , plus plaintiffs Frasco and \nMeigs , are proposed as the representatives for the nationwide classes.4 \nPlaintiffs and defendant Flurry ha ve settled .  Dkt. Nos. 503, 589 .  The Court recently \ngranted preliminar y approv al in principle  for the  classwide settlement  subject to further \nproceedings not germane here.  See Dkt. No. 597.  Consequently, Flurry will not be considered  for \ncertification purposes  here.   \nLEGAL STANDARDS  \nThe goal of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 is “to select the method best suited to \nadjudication of the controversy fairly and efficiently.”  Schneider v. YouTube, LLC , 674 F. Supp. \n3d 704, 715 (N.D. Cal. 2023) (citation omitted).  “The class action is ‘an exception to the usual \nrule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.’”  Comcast \nCorp. v. Behrend , 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013) (citation omitted).   \n“To come within the exception, plaintiffs bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of \nthe evidence that the proposed classes satisfy all four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one \nof the subsections of Rule 23(b).”  In re Google Play Store Antitrust Litig. , No. 21 -md-02981 -JD, \n2022 WL 17252587, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2022).  The four requirements of Rule 23(a) are: \n“sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, typicality of claims or defenses, \nand adequacy of representation. ”  In re Capacitors Antitrust Litig. , No. 17 -md-02801 -JD, 2018 \nWL 5980139 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 14, 2018) (quoting Comcast Corp. , 569 U.S. at 33).  For Rule 23(b),  \nplaintiffs seek to certify both (b)(2) and (b)(3) classes.  The classes seeking injunctive relief must \nshow that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally \nto the class .”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) .  The proposed damages classes must show that “questions \n \n4  Plaintiffs did not say why named plaintiffs Pietrzyk,  Ridgway, and Kiss are not seeking \nappointment as class representatives under Rule 23.  The Court construes this to mean that they \nremain in the case as class members only.  Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 5 of 35 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of law or fact common to class members predominate” over individual issues and that “a class \naction is superior to other available methods” for adjudicating the dispute .  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(3).  \nRule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement tasks the Court with “look[ing] for a common \ncontention ‘capable of classwide resolution -- which means that determination of its truth or falsity \nwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.’”  \nSchneider , 674 F. Supp. 3d at 716 (quoting Alcantar v. Hobart Serv. , 800 F.3d 1047, 1052 (9th \nCir. 2015)).  The class need not be totally uniform, but plaintiffs must demonstrate the “capacity \nof a class -wide proceeding to gene rate common answers  apt to drive the resolution of the \nlitigation.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)  (emphasis in original)  \n(citation  omitted).  Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement is related to the commonality \nrequirement but is more demanding.  It asks “whether the common, aggregation -enabling, issues \nin the case are more prevalent or more important than the non -common, aggregati on-defeating, \nindividual issues.”  Schneider , 674 F. Supp. 3d at 716 (quoting Olean Wholesale Groc ery Coop., \nInc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC , 31 F.4th 651, 664 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc)).   \n“If the defendant provides evidence that a valid defense -- affirmative or otherwise -- will \nbar recovery on some claims,” the Court must “determine, based on the particular facts of the case, \nwhether individualized questions will overwhelm common ones.’”  Van v. LLR, Inc. , 61 F.4th \n1053, 1067 (9th Cir. 2023) ( cleaned up ) (citations omitted).  “Each element of a claim need not be \nsusceptible to classwide proof,” Schneider , 674 F. Supp. 3d at 716 (citing Amgen Inc. v. Conn. \nRet. Plans and Trust Funds , 568 U. S. 455, 468 -69 (2013)), and the “important questions apt to \ndrive the resolution of the litigation are given more weight in the predominance analysis over \nindividualized questions which are of considerably less significance to the claims of the class .”  \nRuiz Torres v. Mercer Canyons Inc. , 835 F.3d 1125, 1134 (9th Cir. 2016).  Certification is \npermissible under Rule 23(b)(3) where “one or more of the central issues in the action are \ncommon to the class and can be said to predominate” even if “other important matters will have to \nbe tried separately, such as damages or some affirm ative defenses particular to some individual \nclass members.”  Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo , 577 U.S. 442, 453 (2016)  (citation omitted) . Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 6 of 35 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly admonished that the certification \nanalysis “must be rigorous and may entail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff’s \nunderlying claim,” but the merits should be considered only insofar as they are “relevant to \ndetermining whether the Rule 23 prerequisites for class certification are satisfied.”  Amgen , 568 \nU.S. at 465 -66 (cleaned up ).  Even with a rigorous inquiry, “Rule 23 grants courts no license to \nengage in free -ranging merits inquiries at the  certification stage.”   Id. at 466 ; see also Google Play \nStore , 2022 WL 17252 587, at *4 ( “The class certification procedure is decidedly not an alternative \nform of summary judgment or an occasion to hold a mini -trial on the merits.” ).  “The decision of \nwhether to certify a class is entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court.”   Google Play \nStore , 2022 WL 172528 57, at *4  (citing Zinser v. Accufix Rsch. Inst., Inc. , 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 \n(9th Cir. 2001)).   \nDISCUSSION  \nI. THE EVIDENCE  \nThe salient inquiry  under Rule 23  is whether plaintiffs have adduced evidence that would \npermit the trier of fact to answer the liability and damages questions  for all class members  on the \nbasis of evidence common to the class as a whole .  The ensuing summary of plaintiffs’ evidence  \nsets the table for answering this inquiry , much of which is not materially in dispute.  \nPlaintiffs start with the representations in the Flo App’s privacy disclosures , namely  that \n(1) Flo “will never share your exact age or any data related to your health with any third parties ,” \nDkt. No. 477 -112 at 9925; (2) “your personal information will never be sold or rented out to third \nparties ,” Dkt. No. 477 -99 at 047 ; and (3) Flo “will not transmit any of your personal data [which \nincludes health data] to third parties, except if  it is required to provide the service to you .  . . unless \nwe have asked for your explicit consent ,” Dkt. No. 477 -110 at 978 ; see also Dkt. Nos. 477 -98-\n111.  These statements were made in more or less the same form to all Flo App users.  \nPlaintiffs also proffered evidence showing that the Flo App ask ed users to share  highly \npersonal reproductive and sexual information  within the app .  To illustrate , users were  asked to \n \n5  Citations to plaintiffs’ exhibits refer to the exhibit’s docket number and the last three digits of \nthe document’s internal Bates number for pagination.  Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 7 of 35 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  share whether they  “[d]idn’t have sex,” had “[p]rotected sex,” or had “[u]nprotected sex.”  Dkt. \nNo. 478 -7 at 828.  Users were  asked  to “[l]og symptoms,” like “ [c]ramps,” “[t]ender [b]reasts,” or \n“[a]cne,” and whether the user had taken any medications.  Dkt. No. 478 -6 (Egelman Rep.) ¶ 41 & \nFigure 8.  Users were  also asked  to log and track details  of their menstrual cycles , such as the \nconsistency of their “Vaginal Discharge,” with options like  “[s]ticky,” “[c]reamy,” or “[s]potting.”  \nDkt. No. 478 -7 at 827 -28; Egelman Rep. Figure 8.  The evidence shows that the app interface and \nprecise names of the inputs varied only marginally  over the class period, such as “Vaginal \nDischarge” versus “Log Fluid,” but the type  and substance  of information capable of being entered \nand tracked were consistent.  Compare  Dkt. No. 478 -7 at 827, with Egelman Rep. Figure 8.     \nPlaintiffs gave specific attention to the data all new Flo App users were required to share \nduring the app’s onboarding process.  They proffered  evidence establishing that a  new user was \nrequired to disclos e: (1) the user’s age; (2) a “goal” from one of three options : (i) “Track my \ncycle,” (ii)  “Get pregnant,” (iii) “Track pregnancy”; (3) the date of the last several menstrual \nperiods and the average length of the periods; and (4) if pregnant, by how many weeks .  See \ngenerally  Dkt. No. 478 -7; see also  478-8 at 891;  Egelman Rep. ¶¶ 40-41 & Figures 7 -8.  The \nevidence indicat es that Flo created and used Custom Events for the onboarding process with \nnames like : “SELECT_LAST_PERIOD_DATE,” “ AGE_ CHOSEN_PREGNANCY,” \n“PREGNANCY_WEEK_CHOSEN_UNKNOWN.”  See, e.g. , Egelman Rep. ¶¶ 60, 62 -63, 69 -72; \nDkt. Nos. 478 -8 at 891; 478 -15 at 738.  \nThe user entries for the Custom Events were sent to Meta and Google by means of their \nrespective SDKs.  See, e.g. , Egelman Rep. ¶¶  60, 62, 65,  81-84, 87 , 103, 105; Dkt. Nos. 478 -15 at \n738; 478 -16 at 380; 478 -17 at 147; 478 -18 at First Supp. Resp. to Interrogatory No. 9, Exh. C; \n478-21.  Neither Google nor Meta had any method of preventing  the SDKs from transmitting \nCustom Events that contain ed private health information.  See, e.g. , Dkt. Nos. 478 -14 at 244:12 -\n21; 478 -51 at 47:2 -19.     \n Plaintiffs presented  evidence showing that the Custom Events  featured  words like \n“pregnancy” and “period ,” which communicated information about the  dates on which a user \nmenstruated or became pregnant .  This type of information is widely understood to be health  Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 8 of 35 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  information .

Part 318”).7 \n Plaintiffs  presented evidence indicating that defendants  commercial ly exploited the user \ndata.  For example, there is evidence that “Flo sold access to the Custom App Event data to third \nparties, including Procter & Gamble .  . . and Bayer” pursuant to, inter alia , “a $3 million contract \nin October 2018  [and] a $7 million contract in October 2019” with Procter & Gamble , and “10 \ncontracts extending through January 2019 and October 2021, totaling $6.04 million” with Bayer.   \nDkt. No. 478 -86 at 38.  Other evidence  indicated  that Flo used Google and Meta’s advertising \nservices to target users with advertisements based on whether the user was tracking her period or \ntrying to get pregnant.  See, e.g. , Dkt. Nos. 478 -55 at 510; 478 -56 at 855 -56; 478 -63 at 058; 478 -\n64; 478 -87 at 938.   Evidence shows t he Custom Events  data funneled to Google and Meta by their \nSDKs was used by both defendants to enhance their machine learning technologies.   See, e.g. , Dkt. \nNos. 478 -31 at Meta’s Resp. to Rog. No. 1 at 13; 478 -68 (Golbeck Rep.) at 20 -43; 478 -71 at 258 -\n59; 478 -66 at 114:2 -8; 478 -67 at 161 .   \n Plaintiffs  also proffered evidence that the user data entered during onboarding and \ntransmitted to Google and Meta was capable of being tied to or identified with a particular person.  \nThe evidence shows  that alongside the  Custom Events, Google and Meta’s SDKs collected  \n“unique” or “persistent” identifiers.

RULE 23( a):  NUMEROSITY, TYPICALITY, & ADEQUACY  \nTurning to the Rule 23 factors, d efendants  did not bother to mention, let alone discuss, \nmost of the requirements for  certification required under Rule 23(a), namely numerosity, \ntypicality, and adequacy .  Even so, the Court  has conducted an independent analysis to determine \nwhether all the elements are satisfied.  \nThe record demonstrates that they  have been met .  To start, the proposed nationwide and \nCalifornia  classes will likely consist of millions of individuals, rendering “joinder of all members \n. . . impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); see, e.g. , Dkt. No. 478 -4.  The record also establishes \nthat all plaintiffs and class members used the Flo App and were subject to the same app and SDK \npractices .  Consequently, t he proposed class representatives’  claims are typical of the class.   See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3);  Just Film, Inc. v. Buono , 847 F.3d 1108, 1116 (9th Cir. 2017) .  The sound \nperformance of plaintiffs’ counsel  during this complex litigation  demonstrates that  they are up to \nthe task of representing the class.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  There is no evidence that the \nnamed plaintiffs are inadequate  or are “situated so differently from the class” that they may be \n“subject to a conflict.”  In re Capacitors Antitrust Litig. , 2018 WL 5980139, at *10.   \nIII. RULE 23(a) (2) COMMONALITY AND  RULE 23(b)(3) PREDOMINANCE  \nIt is “appropriate to assess Rule 23(a)(2) commonality and Rule 23(b)(3) predominance \ntogether,” with a careful eye toward their differences as warranted.  In re Capacitors Antitrust \nLitig. , 2018 WL 59 80139, at *3.  The analysis is grounded in “the elements of the underlying \ncause [s] of action ,” which are discussed in greater detail below.   Klein v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , --- \nF. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 489871, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2025) (quoting Erica P. John Fund, \nInc. v. Halliburton Co. , 563 U.S. 804, 80 9 (2011)).   \nDefendants flagged four “global” concerns that they believe are grounds for denying \ncertification.  These are implied consent, a contractual limitations term, a class action waiver, and \nstanding, each of which is said to bar certification independently of the others.  The Court will Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 10 of 35 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  resolve these objections and then turn to the predominance and commonality analysis of each of \nplaintiffs’ legal claims . \nThe ensuing discussion uses the substantive law of California.  Plaintiffs proposed the use \nof California law because Flo’s terms of use state that California law  governs  and Google and \nMeta’s principal places of business are in California, such that decisions about SDK design and \nadvertising may reasonabl y be understood to have occurred there .  Dkt. No.  477 at 14; see, e.g. , \nDkt. Nos. 477 -121 at 573; 477 -122 at 584; see also  Clothesrigger, Inc. v. GTE Corp. , 191 Cal. \nApp. 3d 605, 612 -13 (1987).  Defendants did not oppose the use of California law  or propose an \nalternative .  They also did not object to using California law for a nationwide class or identify any \nconflicts  that such an application might pose with the laws of other states.   See In re H yundai and \nKia Fuel Econ. Litig. , 926 F.3d 539, 561 -62 (9th Cir. 2019); see also  Olean , 31 F.4th at 6 65-66.   \nA. Implied Consent  \nDefendants’ first objection to (b)(3) certification concerns user consent.  Defendants say \nusers impliedly consented to sharing their personal information “through their conduct when they \ncontinued to use the application [] despite exposure to materials that disclosed the challenged \npractices.”  Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 10 (citation omitted).  In defendants’ view, “it will be impossible to \nadjudicate implied consent on a classwide basis” because the “defense would be based on \nindiv idual, and subjective, interaction s of what certain class members knew, read, saw, or \nencountered.”  Id. at 10 -11 (citation omitted).   \nNot so.  Consent may be express or implied, but as the Court  concluded earlier in this case , \nit must be “actual.”  Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc. , No. 21 -cv-00757 -JD, 2024 WL 4280933, at *2 \n(N.D. Cal. Sept. 23, 2024).  “For consent to be actual, the disclosures must ‘explicitly notify’ users \nof the conduct at issue.”  Calhoun v. Google, LLC , 113 F.4th 1141, 1147 (9th Cir. 2024) (quoting \nIn re Google Inc. , No. 13 -md-02430 -LHK, 2013 WL 5423918, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2013)).  \nThe evidence of notice that must  be established before an individual may be deemed to have \nconsented is greater than that required to show she had inquiry notice.  Consent “is only effective \nif the person alleging harm consented ‘to the particular conduct, or to substantially the same Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 11 of 35 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  conduct’ and if the alleged tortfeasor did not exceed the scope of that consent.”  Flo Health , 2024 \nWL 4280933, at *2 ( quoting Calhoun , 113 F.4th at 1147 ).   \n Because defendants raise implied consent as an affirmative defense, they bear the burden \nof “invok[ing] individualized issues and provid[ing] sufficient evidence that the individualized \nissues bar recovery on at least some claims, thus raising the spect re of class -member -by-class -\nmember adjudication of the issue.”  Van, 61 F.4th at 1067.  To be sure, plaintiffs “retain the \nburden of showing that the proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23,” but the Court’s \npredominance analysis is limited to t he “defenses [a defendant] has actually advanced and for \nwhich it has presented evidence.”   True Health Chiro., Inc. v. McKesson Corp. , 896 F.3d 923, 931 \n(9th Cir. 2018).  Speculation about events or issues  for which a defendant has not offered evidence \nwill not do.  See, e.g. , Miles v. Kirkland’s Stores Inc. , 89 F.4th 1217, 1222 (9th Cir. 2024).   \nDefendants rely  on three buckets  of evidence as the ostensible proof  of consent .  The first \nbucket is press coverage involving a Wall Street Journal  article from February 22, 2019,  and other \nsubsequent news articles reporting on Flo’s alleged misconduct.  App’x 688 -705.8  Defendants \nmade no effort to demonstrate that a meaningful portion of the proposed classes might have seen \nor read these three specific articles with , for example,  evidence about the readership of the \nnewspapers or articles.  This shortfall is in distinct contrast to the presentation of such evidence in \nthe cases defendants cite.  See Brown v. Google, LLC , No. 20 -cv-3664 -YGR, 2022 WL 17961497, \nat *18 -19 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2022) (evidence about how frequently the sources of the asserted \ndisclosures were viewed and by whom); In re Google Inc. Gmail Litig. , No. 13 -md-02430 -LHK, \n2014 WL 1102660, at *17 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2014) (same).  Moreover, the earli est of the three \narticles was published less than a week before the end of the class period.  App’x 688.  \nConsequently , only class members who completed the onboarding process in that narrow \ntimeframe might be covered .  Such a tiny fraction of the class can be readily handled by the Court \nlater in the case, as circumstances warrant.  See Ruiz Torres , 835 F.3d at 1137.  Defendants have \n \n8  All citations to “App’x” refer to defendants’ Joint Appendix and use the appendix’s internal \npagination.  Dkt. Nos. 490 -3; 491 -1. Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 12 of 35 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  not demonstrated otherwise and did not contend that implied consent can be retroactive under \nCalifornia law to the start of the class period.   \nThe second bucket of evidence consists of privacy disclosures  by each of the defendants .  \nIn making this argument, d efendants c ame unacceptably close to misrepresentation.  They  say that  \n“Flo’s June 2016 privacy policy explained Flo ‘may share information, including [users’] \npersonally identifying information’ with third parties, ‘including .  . . Facebook,” Dkt. No. 490 -2 at \n8 (alteration in original) (quoting App’x 1510), but they omitted, presumably purposefully, \nadjacent statements that Flo would not “sell or rent any of your personal information to third \nparties” and that disclosures will be “to help provide, understand and improve our application.”  \nApp’x 1510.  Defendants also say  Flo’s “May 2018 privacy policy informed users that ‘[a]mong \nothers we may share your Personal Data with .  . . Facebook and Google,” Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 8 \n(alteration in original) (quoting App’x 1519 -20), but they again omitted adjacent language stating \nthat “[Flo] may share certain Personal Data , excluding information regarding your marked cycles, \npregnancy, symptoms, notes and other information that is entered by you and that you do not elect \nto share, with third party vendors who supply software applications, web hosting and other \ntechnologies for the App,” App’x 1519.  The omissions subvert anything of potential value in \ndefendants’ statements about the privacy disclosures and raise a troubling question of defendants’ \ncandor with the Court.   \nIt also bears mention that  the evidence of Flo’s privacy disclosures is common to the class .  \nThe common disclosures  will permit a jury to conclude in one fell swoop  whether a reasonable \nperson would have been on notice  of, and so could impliedly consent to, “the particular conduct, \nor to substantially the same conduct.”  Calhoun , 113 F.4th at 1147 (citation omitted).  The \nrelevance of Google and Meta’s privacy disclosures is not obvious in light of plaintiffs’ evidence \nof secret data sharing, but those dis closures, too, are subject to common proof.    \nDefendants ’ third  bucket  of evidence consists of publications and studies from outside the \nUnited States or before the class period  -- in some cases even before Flo was in business .  App’x \n708-11, 730 -32, 737 -43.  Defendants did not say how foreign  materials might reasonably have put \na Flo App user in the United States on notice of the challenged conduct, or establish  their consent Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 13 of 35 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “to the particular conduct, or to substantially the same conduct.”  Calhoun , 113 F.4th at 1147 \n(citation omitted).  The same goes for the materials dating from before the class period or Flo’s \ncorporate existence .  More over, the record indicates that, well after the older  materials were \npublished, Flo  expressly  represented to  its users that it would “never share .  . . any data related to \nyour health with any third parties.”  Dkt. No. 477 -112 at 992.  It is a riddle how publications pre -\ndating these represen tations could  be a basis of subsequent notice or consent, especially in light of \nthe plain meaning of “never” in Flo’s statement .  And once again, defendants did not provide \nevidence of readership that might show that  a meaningful portion of the class saw any of these \npublications.   App’x 734 -35, 745 -47.   \nB. Contractual  Limitations Period  \nDefendants’ second overarching objection to (b)(3) certification concerns a contractual \nlimitations term.  Plaintiffs mark February 28, 2019 , as the end of the class period , and the original \ncomplaint was filed in January 2021.  Dkt. Nos. 1; 477 at 1.  Defendants say plaintiffs’ claims are \n“presumptively untimely” under a one-year deadline for filing a claim in the Flo App terms of \nservice.  Dkt. No.  490-2 at 7; App’x 1531, 1538.  Defendants add that plaintiffs’ tolling argument, \nbased on Flo’s alleged fraudulent concealment, poses an impediment to certification  because  \n“there is no way to figure out who knew what, and when, without a mini -trial for each Flo app \nuser.”  Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 7.   \nThe point is not well taken.  To start, defendants were unduly vague about which party \namong them  might permissibly assert the contractual  defense.  The  provision is in Flo’s terms of \nservice , but defendants suggest that Google and Meta might somehow benefit from it as well.  See \nDkt. No.  490-2 at 7.  Why that might be so was never explained, and nothing in the plain language \nof the one -year period in Flo’s terms of service indicates that it might apply to Google and Meta.  \nApp’x 1531 -39.  Defendants made a vague aside that “there are various other (short) statutory \nlimitations periods ,” Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 7 n.1 , but that too was not explained or developed into a \nmeaningful argument.  The Court declines to take up plaintiffs’ equally underdeveloped \nsuggestion, also buried in a footnote, that the limitatio ns provision is unenforceable.  Dkt. \nNo. 496-3 at 3 n.4.   Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 14 of 35 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  With respect to Flo, the one-year period in the terms of service is not a bar to certification.  \nAs a general rule, “the presence of individual issues of compliance with the statute of limitations” \ndoes not necessarily “defeat the predominance of the common questions.”  Cameron v. E.M . \nAdams & Co. , 547 F.2d 473, 478 (9th Cir. 1976 ).  That is particularly true when, as here, Flo’s \nrepresentations to each class member were the same, which permits the question of fraudulent \nconcealment to be answered on a clas swide basis.  See, e.g. , Dkt. Nos. 477 -111; 477 -112; 478 -7 at \n803; see also Bernson v. Browning -Ferris Indus. , 7 Cal. 4th 926, 931 (1994) ( under the principle \nof fraudulent concealment, a “ defendant ’s fraud in concealing a cause of action against him tolls \nthe applicable statute of limitations, but only for that period during which the claim is \nundiscovered by  plaintiff or until such time as plaintiff, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, \nshould have discovered it. ” (quotations and citation omitted) ).  \nThe question of whether and when putative class members might have had inquiry notice, \nsee Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 7 -10, is also amenable to a classwide answer of “yes” or “no” based on \ncommon proof.  The standard for inquiry notice under California law is an objective one.  See \nBrewer v. Remington , 46 Cal. App. 5th 14, 24 (2020).  The jury here will need only to look to the \nFlo App’s  privacy representations and the news articles that Flo believes provided notice to decide \nwhether a reasonable person was on inquiry notice of  the alleged  wrongdoing .9  See Jolly v. Eli \nLilly & Co. , 44 Cal. 3d 1103, 1110 -11 (1988); Brewer , 46 Cal. App. 5th at 24.  Assuming in Flo’s \nfavor purely for discussion that the hurdle of proving widespread readership has been crossed, t he \nanswer will be common to all users.  See Unruh -Haxton v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. , 162 Cal. App. \n4th 343, 364 (2008).10 \n \n9  Defendants cite the same news articles discussed in the implied consent section for the notice \ncontention.   \n \n10  Flo made a passing aside to the effect that the news reports it presented were only a few of the \n“many ways users could have learned about the challenged data -sharing practices.”  Dkt. \nNo. 490-2 at 1, 7.  T his comment again was not developed with evidence of what the other sources \nmight have been, and Flo’s vague conjecture is of no moment for certification purposes.  See True \nHealth , 896 F.3d at 932.  \n Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 15 of 35 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  In all other respects , the issue  of actual notice cannot do the work Flo asks of it.  “The \nexistence of a statute of limitations issue does not compel a finding that individual issues \npredominate over common ones” where there is “a sufficient nucleus of common questions.”  \nWilliams v. Sinclair , 529 F.2d 1383, 1388 (9th Cir. 1975); see Cameron , 547 F.2d at 478.  As \ndiscussed,  plaintiffs have established such a  nucleus .  Consequently, the Court cannot conclude \nthat the questions raised by the contractual limitations defense are “more prevalent or important” \nthan “the common, aggregation -enabling, issues in the case.”  Olean , 31 F.4th at 664.  \nC. Class Action Waiver  \nThe third overarching objection to certification concerns a waiver of class actions.  The Flo \nApp’s terms of service state that “[a]ll claims between the parties related to this Agreement will be \nlitigated individually and the parties will not consolidate or seek class treatment for any claim, \nunless previously agr eed to in writing by the parties.”11  App’x 1531, 1538.   \nPlaintiffs ’ challenge  to the waiver on grounds of unconscionability, Dkt. No. 496 -3 at 15 , \nis sustained.   “Under California law, a contract provision is unenforceable due to \nunconscionability only if it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.”  Shroyer v. \nNew Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc. , 498 F.3d 976, 981 (9th Cir. 2007).  Procedural \nunconscionability focuses on “oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,” while \nsubstantive unconscionability is concerned with “overly harsh or one-sided results.”  Discover \nBank v. Superior Court , 36 Cal. 4th 148, 160 (2005) (cleaned up), abrogated on other grounds by \nAT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion , 563 U.S. 333 (2011).  Each  element  need not be present in \nequal degrees; “the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of \nprocedural unconscionability is required .  . . and vice versa.”  Armendariz v. Found. Health \nPsychcare Servs., Inc. , 24 Cal. 4th 83, 114 (2000).  The basic “notion [is] that unconscionability \nrequires a substantial degree of unfairness beyond ‘a simple old -fashioned bad bargain .’”  \nSanchez v. Valencia Hold . Co., LLC , 61 Cal. 4th 899, 911 (2015) (emphasis in original) (citation \nomitted).   Although c lass action waivers are not categorically unconscionable in California , \n \n11  Google and Meta made no effort to say why this provision in Flo’s terms of service might apply \nto them.  The Court addresses the argument solely with respect to Flo.   Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 16 of 35 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  enforcement may be denied when they are “found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting \nin which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages, \nand when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme \nto deli berately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.”   \nDiscover Bank , 36 Cal. 4th at 162.   \nFlo says that Discover Bank  does not apply here and that the waiver should be enforced \nbecause the claims do not involve small sums of money.  Dkt. No.  490-2 at 25.  As Flo points out, \nplaintiffs seek thousands of dollars in statutory damages.   Id.   \nBut the California Court of Appeal has expressly concluded that Discover Bank  did not \n“hold that class action waivers are unconscionable only in the circumstances it described” and has \nfound such waivers unenforceable due to unconscionability even when the plaintiffs’ recovery \nwould not be insubstantial.  See, e.g. , Cohen v. DIRECTV, Inc. , 142 Cal. App. 4th 1442, 1451, \n1453 -55 (2006) (discussing cases); Indep. Ass’n of Mailbox Ctr. Owners, Inc. v. Superior Court , \n133 Cal. App. 4th 396, 404 n.4, 409 -10 (2005); see also Shroyer , 498 F.3d at 983 (“[T]here are \nmost certainly circumstances in which a class action waiver is unconscionable under California \nlaw despite the fact that all three parts of the Discover Bank  test are not satisfied.”).12   \nAs the Supreme Court  of California  has determined, the unconscionability analysis is \n“highly dependent on context.”  Sanchez , 61 Cal. 4th at 911.  The specific context of Flo’s conduct \nreveals a high degree of procedural unconscionability.  T he waiver is in a contract of adhesion  \nwhich was offered to users on a “take it or leave it” basis.  See, e.g. , Ronderos v. USF Reddaway, \nInc., 114 F.4th 1080, 1089 -90 (9th Cir. 2024).  It is presented  under the heading “Miscellaneous” \nas a single sentence at the end of  the terms of use .  See, e.g. , App’x 1531; Dkt. Nos. 447 -121 at \n573; 477 -122 at 585.  It is not visually highlighted or differentiated in any way, even though other \n \n12  As with Discover Bank , all three of these cases were abrogated in part by Concepcion , only \nwith respect to the invalidation of class action waivers in arbitration agreements due to \nunconscionability.  Flo does not seek to enforce an arbitration agreement, and Concepcion  did not \naffect general unconscionability principles outside of the arbitration context.  See Sonic -Calabasas \nA, Inc. v. Moreno , 57 Cal. 4th 1109, 1143 (2013) (“ Concepcion  clarifie[d] the limits the FAA \nplaces on state unconscionability rules as they pertain to arbitration agreements.”).  \n Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 17 of 35 \n31 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the third can be shown by evidence relating to the Custom Events, the SDKs, and the data that  \nGoogle and Meta did or did not receive during the class period.   \nContrary to Flo’s contention, see Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 20 (citing Aguilera v. Pirelli Armstrong \nTire Corp. , 223 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir. 2000)), California law does not require a showing of “actual \ndamage” for a breach of contract claim.  R ecent rulings by the California Court of Appeal \nexpressly disagreed with Aguilera  and held that “California courts have applied section 3360 to \nconclude that ‘[a] plaintiff is entitled to recover nominal damages for the breach of a contract, \ndespite inability to show that actual damage was inflicted upon him.’”15  Elation Sys., Inc. v. Fenn \nBridge LLC , 71 Cal. App. 5th 958, 965 -67 (2021) (quoting Sweet v. Johnson , 169 Cal. App. 2d \n630, 632 (1959)); Garcia v. Bank of Stockton , No. F084375, 2023 WL 8795765, at *8 (Cal. Ct. \nApp. Dec. 20, 2023)  (unpub.) ; see also  Cal. Civ. Code § 3360  (“When a breach of duty has caused \nno appreciable detriment to the party affected, he may yet recover nominal damages. ”).  Flo did \nnot present a good argument that the California Supreme Court would reach a contrary conclusion, \nso the Court will follow th ese decisions as the s tatements of California law .  See Cherkin , 2025 \nWL 844378, at *1.   In consequence, individual questions about actual damages do not defeat  \npredomina nce because no such questions are posed.  \nI. California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA)  \nPlaintiffs seek the certification of a California subclass for claims against Google and Meta \nunder the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), Cal. Pen. Code §§ 631 -32.  Section 631 \nprohibits the use, or attempted use, of “electronic means to ‘learn the contents or meaning’ of any \n‘communication’ ‘without consent’  or in an ‘unauthorized manner.’ ”  In re Facebook , 956 F.3d at \n607 (quoting Cal. Pen. Code § 631(a)).  Section 632 makes it unlawful to “intentionally and \nwithout consent of all parties to a confidential communication” use a “recording device to \neavesd rop upon or record the confidential communication.”  Cal. Pen. Code  § 632(a).

Pen. Code § 631(a) .  They state that most of the servers for the SDKs are located outside \nCalifornia and there is no classwide method of determining whether California resid ent users \ncompleted the onboarding process while they were in California.  Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 22 -23.  \nDefendants do not explain why this might be  relevant  to the §  632 claim  as nothing in the plain \ntext of that section suggests such a geographic limitation, but the point is well taken for plaintiffs’ \nclaim under §  631.   \nPlaintiffs say they have  evidence demonstrating that “Flo’s location data shows which \nusers were in California,” Dkt. No.  496-3 at 12,  but they fall short of showing which users \ncompleted the onboarding  process  in California.  The evidence consists of a few exhibits \ncontaining hundreds of lines of incomprehensible code , and a line or two reading something like \n“‘time_zone’:‘America/New_York .’”  Dkt. No. 478 -44 at 004 .  What this evidence might mean or \nhow it is germane to certification is  unexplained .  Consequently, it does not resolve the server \nlocation question in a reasonable manner for the putative class.  Plaintiffs make the passing \ncomment  that they have evidence that Google and Met a are “based in California , where they \ndesigned their SDKs and use the data intercepted through that technology.”  Dkt. No. 496 -3 at 12.  \nThat also does not answer the salient question.  T he case plaintiffs cite is inapposite  because the \ncomplaint there alleged the defendants “received the interception” in California and “intercepted Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 32 of 35 \n33 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiff’s and Class members’ communications and data with Favor, who is headquartered in \nCalifornia, in real time.”  Doe v. FullStory, Inc. , 712 F. Supp. 3d 1244, 1260 (N.D.

RULE 23(b)(3) SUPERIORITY  \n“The final certification question [for certification under Rule 23(b)(3)] is whether the ends \nof justice and efficiency are served by certification.”  DZ Reserv e v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , No. 18 -\ncv-04978 -JD, 2022 WL 912890, at *9  (N.D. Cal. Mar. 29, 2022), aff’d in part by  96 F.4th 1223 \n(9th Cir. 2024), cert. denied  145 S.Ct. 1051 (Mem.) (2025) .  There is no doubt th at a class action \nis the superior method of adjudicating  the users’ claims , compared to those millions of users  \nindividually suing the three remaining defendants.   \nThe record amply demonstrates discovery was complicated and voluminous, to say the \nleast, and defendants are represented by  law firms  with deep resources , all of which demonstrate \nthat litigating these claims entails  “relatively high costs.”  Just Film , 847 F.3d at 1123; see DZ \nReserve , 2022 WL 912890, at *9 (noting the “cost and other resources required to litigate against a \ncompany like Meta”).  Resolution of the common questions discussed in this order on a classwide \nbasis will promote efficiency by  (1) bypassing the need to relitigate identical questions and \nconduct nearly identical discovery in parallel litigations and (2) avoid ing the strain on scarce \njudicial resources that suits by individual Flo App users would impose.  See Just Film , 847 F.3d at \n1123 -24; Valentino v. Carter -Wallace, Inc. , 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 -35 (9th Cir. 1996).  Superiority is \nsatisfied.  \nV. RULE 23( b)(2) \nPlaintiffs ’ cursory request to certify  nationwide and California classes for injunctive relief \nunder Rule 23(b)(2) , Dkt. No. 477 at 24 -25, is denied .  A Rule 23(b)(2) class is “appropriate only \nwhere the primary relief sought is declaratory and injunctive .”  Zinser , 253 F.3d at 1195.  The \nfocus for most of the plaintiffs’  claims was on some sort of monetary relief,  and plaintiffs’ motion \npapers hardly gave the  proposed injunctive relief  classes any attention.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Fizz Social Corp. (FSC), a social media platform, sought a preliminary injunction to prevent Instacart and Partiful from using the \"FIZZ\" trademark for a new app called \"Fizz by Instacart,\" which facilitates group orders of drinks and snacks. FSC argued that the use of \"FIZZ\" in the app's name infringed on its trademark, leading to confusion among consumers. The court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that FSC did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, or that the balance of equities or public interest favored an injunction.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue was whether Instacart’s use of the FIZZ trademark in its new app created a likelihood of confusion with FSC’s existing use of the same mark in its social media platform.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that FSC did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of its trademark infringement claims, primarily because it failed to show that Defendants' use of the FIZZ mark would cause consumer confusion. Furthermore, FSC did not establish irreparable harm, and the balance of equities and public interest did not favor granting the preliminary injunction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of FSC as a soda brand called \"Fizz\" sold in college cafes, and Instacart wants to start delivering bubbles and chips, also calling it \"Fizz.\" FSC was worried people would mix them up since they both use the name \"Fizz,\" thinking the delivery was part of the original soda brand’s business. The court decided there's no big problem with confusion right now—though both have the same name, their logos and what they offer (social connections vs. snacks delivery) are quite different. So, the court said Instacart can keep using the name \"Fizz\" for now.",

See Mot. \n(dkt. 11).  The Court DENIES the motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Fizz Social Corp. \nFSC grew out of two Stanford students’ vision of “a private platform centered \naround common experiences, starting with campus  life.”  Solomon Decl. (dkt. 12) ¶ 4.  \nThey initially launched the plat form on the Apple App Store on January 25, 2021 under the \nname “Buzz,” which referred to the “buzz” on ca mpus.  Id. ¶ 5.  They rebranded as “Fizz” \non January 5, 2022, intending to evoke “the dynamic nature of campus culture.”  Id.2  Fizz \nusers “verify with their student (.edu) email to access their college Fizz community,” and \nthen can “post images, videos, events, polls, GIFs, links, direct messages, and so much \n \n1 For the sake of simplicity, this order frequent ly refers to Defendants in the collective. \n2 FSC incorporated its slogan into the name of its App: “Fizz: What’s Fizzin’?”  Id. ¶ 31.

Posts on Fizz are anonymous.  Id. ¶¶ 23, 34, 43; Jacob Decl. (dkt. 41-1) Ex. \n28 at 2.  Users view content through a scro llable feed of anonymous posts.  Jacob Decl. \nEx. 17.   \nThe Fizz platform grew rapidly at Stanford .  Solomon Decl. ¶ 7.   Less than three \nmonths after launching, about 95% of Stanford  undergraduates were registered on Fizz.  \nId. ¶ 8.  Fizz expanded to other college campuse s, and is now operating at over 400.  Id. ¶¶ \n9, 13.  At many of those schools, more than 90% of the student body is on Fizz.  Id. ¶ 16.  \nOne use for Fizz is to publicize events: “ [f]raternities and sororities could post an \ninvitation to an upcoming part y, and students throughout the community . . . would \ninstantly receive the invitati on.”  Solomon Decl. ¶ 11.  Ov er 130,000 events have been \norganized through Fizz, ranging from parties to sporting events.  Id. ¶ 18.  Fizz uses an \n“ambassador program,” through which students on campus generate intere st in Fizz.  Id. ¶ \n19.  Fizz also has over 3,000 volunteer st udent moderators nationwide who work to \nmaintain civility on the platfo rm.  Id. ¶ 20.  FSC has spen t about $9.4 million on launches \nand campus contractor expens es.  Solomon Decl. ¶ 21. \nOn May 9, 2023, FSC debuted the Fizz Mark etplace, which allows users to buy and \nsell items within the users’ particular camp us communities.  Id. ¶ 23.  The platform \nlaunched nationwide in early 2024.  Id.  Stude nts use the Marketplace to sell things like \nclothes, textbooks, and bikes to fellow studen ts.  Id.; see also id. ¶ 43 (image of Fizz \nMarketplace on phones).  FSC does not provide a snack and beverage de livery service.  Id. \n¶ 84.  Nor does FSC handle the posting, deliver y, or payment on the Marketplace—rather, \nit provides a forum for users to connect .  See Jacob Decl. Ex. 22 at 4.   \nIn September 2024, FSC began running ads on  Fizz.  Id. ¶ 27.  Brands advertise on \nFizz as a way to reach a Gen-Z audience.  Id.  Also in 2024, FSC established a general Fizz \nfeed that includes users who are not in college .  Id. ¶ 29.  That product is called Global \nFizz.  Id. ¶ 30.  It does not include the Fizz  Marketplace product.  See Jacob Decl. Ex. 11. \nFSC has used the FIZZ mark continuously nationwide since January 5, 2022.

FSC also applied for federal registra tion of its marks by filing federal trademark \napplications in January 2024 and May 7, 2025.  See Solom on Decl. Exs. 26, 27.  FSC’s \nmark sometimes appears like this: \n      \nSolomon Decl. ¶ 36.  On the app itself, the bee image appears without the word “Fizz,” \nand one of the categories of posts is “Fizzin’.”  Id. ¶ 37.  Sometimes, the FIZZ mark \nappears with the bee imag e and bubbles around it: \n        \nId. ¶ 74. \nB. Instacart \nInstacart is an online platform that allows users to  shop for groceries from local \nretailers and have them delivered by personal shoppers.  Weintraub Decl. (dkt. 40-3) ¶ 3.  \nIt was founded in 2012 and now partners with over 1,800 bra nds to deliver groceries from \nnearly 100,000 stores.  Id. ¶¶ 3,  5.

Instacart has ove r 20 million annual us ers.  Id. ¶ 13. \nC. Fizz by Instacart \nOn May 6, 2025, Instacart launched the Fizz  by Instacart app.  Id. ¶¶ 2, 16.  Fizz by \nInstacart is an online de livery app that facilitates group orde rs of drinks and snacks.  Id. ¶ \n2.  Instacart built the app on top of Insta cart’s existing grocery delivery e-commerce \nplatform.  Id.  Fizz by Instacart features a flat delivery fee, no membership requirement, \nearned savings, and automatic payment splitti ng among group members.  Id. ¶ 16.  \nInstacart selected the name Fizz because it “e vokes both carbonated  beverages and the \nspirited energy of celebrations and special occasions.”  Id. ¶ 17. \nCustomers can access Fizz by Instacart either by downloading the app or by \nnavigating to fizz.com on a mobile browser.  Id. ¶ 18.  Customers are taken to a \nregistration page where they can create an account if they ar e 21 or older.  Id.  They are \nthen taken to a virtual storefront where they ca n purchase drinks and snacks.  Id.  They can \n“Start a Party Cart” in order to invite others to  join their shopping expe rience.  Id. ¶ 19.  To \njoin, those users must confirm that they are 21 or older and sign up for an account.  Id. ¶ \n20.

Procedural History \nFSC contends that Instacart and Partiful  are infringing on FSC’s FIZZ mark.  It \nasserts that “Using an identical FIZZ mark, to target th e same demographic, and provide \nthe same social event coordination services, is confusing and damaging. ”  Mot. at 2.  On \nMay 7, 2025, FSC brought su it alleging: (1) common law trademark infringement; (2) \nfalse designation of origin an d unfair competition, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a); (3) \nviolation of the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act,  pursuant to 15 U.S.C. § \n1125(d); (4) violation of California’s Unfair Competition Law, pursuant to Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200; (5) and declaratory relief.  See Compl. (dkt. 1).  FSC has now brought \na motion for preliminary injunc tion based on the trademark clai ms.  See Mot.; Reply (dkt. \n47).  Defendants oppose the motion.  See Op p’n (dkt. 40-2); Surreply (dkt. 49-2).  The \nCourt held a motion hearing on July 10 , 2025.  See Motion Hearing (dkt. 53). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordi nary remedy that may only be awarded \nupon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entit led to such relief.”  See Winter v. Natural \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (20 08).  The party seeking a preliminary injunction \nmust establish: (1) a likelih ood of success on the merits; (2) a likelihood of irreparable \nharm absent preliminary relief; (3) that the ba lance of equities tips in the plaintiff’s favor; \nand (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.  See id. at  20.  Alternatively, the moving \nparty must demonstrate that “s erious questions going to the merits were raised and the Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 6 of 36 \n7 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californiabalance of hardships tips sharply in the plaint iff's favor,” and that the other two Winter \nelements are met.  Alliance fo r Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 63 2 F.3d 1127, 113 4–35 (9th Cir. \n2011).  \nIII. DISCUSSION \nFSC argues that it is entitled to a preliminar y injunction because it has satisfied each \nof the Winter elements. \nA. Likelihood of Success \nA party seeking a preliminar y injunction must establish a likelihood of success on \nthe merits.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  FSC argues  that it is likely to succeed on the merits of \nits trademark infringement claims3 because (1) it has a protected ownership interest in its \nFIZZ marks and (2) Defendants’ use of FIZZ in  connection with its app is likely to cause \nconfusion.  Mot. at 3. \n1. Ownership of Marks \nThe first requirement for trademark infringem ent is ownership of a valid trademark.  \nSee Network Automation, Inc. v. Advanced Sy s. Concepts, Inc., 638 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th \nCir. 2011).  FSC contends that it owns valid and protectable trademarks.  Mot. at 3.  \n“[E]ven if a trademark is not federally registered, it may still be enforceable under § 43(a) \nof the Lanham Act.”  Matal v. Tam, 582 U. S. 218, 225 (2017).  A plaintiff who cannot \npoint to a federally registered trademark must  demonstrate (1) prior use of the mark in \ncommerce, and (2) entitlement to protection.  OpenAI, Inc. v. Open Artificial Intelligence, \nInc., 719 F. Supp. 3d 1033 , 1046–47 (N.D. Cal. 2024). \nAs to prior use, the Lanham Act requires “the bona fide use of a mark in the \nordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark.”  15 U.S.C. § \n1127.  Courts use a “totality of the circumstan ces approach” in evaluating priority of use, \nwhich turns on “first, adoption, and second, use in a way sufficiently pu blic to identify or \n \n3 These are the claims for trademark infringem ent, false designation of origin, and unfair \ncompetition.  Mot. at 3.  “Claims for false designation of origin under the Lanham Act and \nunfair competition under California common la w both share a common test: likelihood of \nconfusion.”  Microsoft Corp. v. Buy More, Inc., 703 F. App’x 476, 479 (9th Cir. 2017). Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 7 of 36 \n8 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californiadistinguish the marked goods in an appropriate segment of the public mind” “as belonging \nto the owner.”  OpenAI, 719 F.  Supp. 3d at 1047 (internal qu otation marks omitted).  Here, \nthere is no dispute that FSC used the FIZZ marks in connection w ith the Fizz platform \nsince January 5, 2022.  Solo mon Decl. ¶¶ 5–7.  Apple made the Fizz platform available \nnationwide through the App Store that same da y.  Id. ¶¶ 31, 33.  And the fizzsocial.app \nwebsite went live on January 27, 2022.  Id . ¶ 35.  FSC has received national media \nattention.  Id. ¶¶ 23, 30, 36, 40 (Forbes, Fort une. TechCrunch, Pulse 2.0, Startup20 India, \nKolsquare, Fast Company).  Moreover, FS C’s use has been both continuous and \nnationwide.  Id. ¶ 15.  FSC has therefore made bona fide use of its FIZZ marks since \nJanuary of 2022. \nAs to entitlement to protection, “[a]n iden tifying mark is distinctive and capable of \nbeing protected if it either (1) is inherently distinctive or (2) has ac quired distinctiveness \nthrough secondary meaning.”  Two Pesos, Inc.  v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 769 \n(1992).  FSC argues that its FIZZ marks are inhere ntly distinctive.  Mo t. at 5.  Marks fall \ninto “one of five categories of increasing dis tinctiveness: (1) generic,  (2) descriptive, (3) \nsuggestive, (4) arbitrary, or (5) fanciful.”  Zobmondo Ent., LLC v. Falls Media, LLC, 602 \nF.3d 1108, 1113 (9th Cir. 2010 ).  FSC argues that its FIZZ marks are suggestive.  See Mot. \nat 5; see also Opp’n at 7 (agreeing that FSC’s FIZZ marks are sugges tive).  “A suggestive \nmark is one for which ‘a consumer must use imagination or any type of multistage reasoning to understand the mark’s significan ce . . . the mark does not describe the \nproduct’s features, but suggests them.”  Zobmondo, 602 F.3d at 1113 (quoting Kendall-\nJackson Winery, Ltd. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery, 150 F.3d 1042 , 1047 n.8 (9th Cir. 1998)).  \nBecause the word “fizz” does not literally desc ribe a social media app, but requires a \nmental leap from the bubbles in a carbonated drink to “the joyful, spontaneous quality of \nsocial connection and collaboration,” Mot. at 5; see also Solomon Decl. ¶ 5 (“the dynamic \nnature of campus culture”), id. ¶ 40 (“fun and e ffervescen[ce] . . . that’s bubbling up”), it is \na suggestive mark.  See Brookfield Commc’ns, Inc. v. West Coast Entm’t Corp., 174 F.3d \n1036, 1058 (9th Cir. 19 99) (“MovieBuff” mark was suggestive where it “require[d] a Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 8 of 36 \n9 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californiamental leap from the mark to the product,” wh ich was software with a searchable database \nof entertainment industry information).  Becaus e the Fizz marks are su ggestive, they “are \ndeemed inherently distinctive,” and they are entitled to protection.  See Two Pesos, 505 \nU.S. at 768. \nDefendants do not actually dis pute either of these points, but they argue that FSC’s \nanalysis focuses on the wrong market.  Defenda nts argue that while FSC has priority in \n“social media services,” FSC “has never offe red grocery delivery,” and so it is Instacart \nthat has priority in the relevant “grocery deli very” market.  Opp’n at 6.  Defendants note \nthat FSC applied for trademark protection in  grocery delivery on May 7, 2025—“the day \nafter Instacart’s launch,” suggesting that FSC knows that it is not in the grocery delivery \nmarket.  Id.  Defendants are correct that the prior use must be “in the same industry and \nmarket or within the senior user’s natural zone of expansion.”  Brookfield Commc’ns, 174 \nF.3d at 1047.  And there is no question that FS C is not in the grocery delivery market.  But \nthe Ninth Circuit has cautioned against “overemp hasiz[ing] differences in principal lines of \nbusiness, as ‘the relatedness of each compan y’s prime directive isn’t relevant.’”  Id. \n(quoting Dreamwerks Prod. Grp., Inc. v. SKG Studio, 142 F.3d 1127 (9th Cir. 1998)).  \nCourts are to ask “whether the consuming public is likely somehow to associate [one \nparty’s] products with [the other party’s].”  Id.  The “principal line[] of business” of \nInstacart is grocery delivery, but the “Fizz by Instacart” initiative, and particularly \nPartiful’s integration of Fizz by Instacart on th e Partiful platform, are about group ordering \nof drinks and snacks in connection with pa rty planning.  The Fizz platform, broadly \nspeaking, allows for the coordinating of gr oup events.  This order will examine the \nproximity of the parties’ goods and services more closely in connec tion with the likelihood \nof confusion factors, but for present purpos es it is sufficient to say that both FSC and \nDefendants offer free mobile ap ps relating to social coordination, which is a similar \nmarket. \nAccordingly, FSC is likely to succeed in demonstrating that it has a protected \nownership interest in its FIZZ marks. Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 9 of 36 \n10 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of California2. Likelihood of Confusion \nThe second requirement for trademark infri ngement is a likelihood of confusion.  \nSee Network Automation, Inc., 638 F.3d at 11 44.  There is a likelihood of confusion \nbetween two products “when consumers ‘are likel y to assume that a product or service is \nassociated with a source other than its actual source because of si milarities between the \ntwo sources’ marks or marketing techniques.’”  Int’l Jensen, Inc. v. Metrosound U.S.A., \nInc., 4 F.3d 819, 825 (9th Cir. 1993) (quotin g Metro Publ’g, Ltd. v. San Jose Mercury \nNews, 987 F.2d 637, 640 (9th Cir. 1993) (abrogated on other grounds)).  The Ninth Circuit \nanalyzes likelihood of confusion by referring to eight factors identified in AMF Inc. v. \nSleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341, 348–49 (9th Cir. 1979 ), abrogated in part on other grounds \nby Mattel, Inc. v. Walking Mount ain Prods., 353 F.3d 792 (200 3): (a) strength of the mark; \n(b) similarity of the marks; (c) proximity of the goods/services  sold; (d) sim ilarity in the \nmarketing channels used; (e) type of goods/ services and degree of care likely to be \nexercised by purchasers; (f) evidence of actu al confusion; (g) defendant’s intent in \nselecting its mark; and (h) likelihood of expa nsion into other markets.  “[A]lthough these \nSleekcraft factors ‘channel the analytical proce ss,’ they do not necessarily dictate a result.”  \nPom Wonderful LLC v. Hubbard, 775 F. 3d 1118, 1125 (9th Cir. 2014) (quoting \nEntrepreneur Media, Inc. v. Smith , 279 F.3d 1135, 1141 (9th Cir. 2002)).  “Because the \nfactors are ‘fluid,’ a ‘plaintiff need not satisfy every factor, pr ovided that strong showings \nare made with respect to some of them.’”  Pom Wonderful, 775 F. 3d at 1125 (quoting \nSurfvivor Media, Inc. v. Survivor Prods. , 406 F.3d 625, 631 (9 th Cir. 2005)).  Three \nespecially important factors in cases involving the Internet are the similarity of the marks, \nthe relatedness of the goods and services, and the simultaneous use of the Internet as a \nmarketing channel.  Network Au tomation, 638 F.3d at 1146.4 \na. Strength of mark \n“The scope of the trademark protection” given a mark “depends upon the strength \n \n4 Network Automation referred sp ecifically to “confusion in th e context of Internet domain \nnames,” which this case does not involve.  See id. Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 10 of 36 \n11 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californiaof the mark, with stronger marks receivi ng greater protection than weak ones.”  \nEntrepreneur Media, 279 F.3d at 1141.  “Thi s is so because a strong mark is ‘inherently \ndistinctive,’ . . . and therefore it is more likely that consumers will be confused by another’s use of the same or similar mark.”  Id. (quoting Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 349).  A \ntrademark’s strength “is evaluated in terms of its [i] conceptual strength and [ii] \ncommercial strength.”  GoTo.com, Inc. v. Wa lt Disney Co., 202 F.3d  1199, 1207 (9th Cir. \n2000). \ni. Conceptual Strength \nAs to conceptual strength, courts are to  place a mark on a “continuum of marks \nfrom generic, afforded no protection; through descriptive or suggestive, given moderate \nprotection; to arbitrary or fanciful[,] awar ded maximum protection.”  E.&J. Gallo Winery \nv. Gallo Cattle Co., 967 F.2d 1280, 1291 (9th Cir. 1992) (cleaned up).  As already \ndiscussed, the parties agree that FSC’s FIZZ ma rks are suggestive, see Mot. at 5; see also \nOpp’n at 7 (agreeing that FSC’s FIZZ marks are suggestive).  Indeed, as in Palantir \nTechnologies, Inc. v. Palantir.net, Inc., No. C07-03863 CRB, 2 008 WL 152339, at *3 \n(N.D. Cal. Jan. 15, 2008), because it requires a mental leap to get fr om the FIZZ marks to \nFSC’s services, those marks are “at the far e nd of the suggestive spectrum, very near to \narbitrary or fanciful, and thus . . . of at l east moderate strength.”  The marks “are deemed \ninherently distinctive” and are en titled to protection.  See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768.   \nii. Commercial Strength \nAs to commercial strength, courts are to look to “‘actual marketplace recognition,’” \nrecognizing that “‘advertising expenditures can  transform a suggestive mark into a strong \nmark.’”  Network Automation, Inc., 638 F.3d at 1149 (quoting Brookfield Commc’ns, 174 \nF.3d at 1058).  There is support in the reco rd for FSC’s marketplac e recognition: FSC is \nnow at over 400 college campuses, and at many of them, 90% of the student body uses the \napp; FSC has spent about $9.4 million on launches and campus cont ractor expenses; and \nFSC has received national media attention.  Solomon Decl. ¶¶ 13, 16, 21, 23, 30, 36, and Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 11 of 36 \n12 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of California40.5  Defendants argue, though, that FSC’s mark is commercially weak because FSC “is \nless than three years old” and it “is not rank ed anywhere near the top of social media \ncompanies by user base.”  Opp’n at 7 (citi ng Jacob Decl. Ex. 31).  Defendants add that \n“there are many apps on the App Store also calle d Fizz,” some of which also offer services \nto college students.  Id. at 8 n.5 (citi ng Jacob Decl. Ex. 10, Ex. 28 at 1).   \nFSC has the stronger argument.  Defenda nts offer no authority supporting their \ncontention that a product less than three year s old is commercially weak.  And while other \nsocial media companies are mo re widely used, see Jacob D ecl. Ex. 31 at 1 (“YouTube and \nFacebook are the most-widely us ed online platforms. . . . TikTok, LinkedIn, X . . . and \nSnapchat” have smaller shares”), id. at 2 (listing additional social media platforms for ages \n18–29), a mark is not weak simply because its  owner is not more popular than YouTube or \nFacebook—if that was the case, th en hardly any company’s marks would merit protection.   \nAlthough “[i]n a crowded field of simila r marks, each member of the crowd is \nrelatively weak in its ability to  prevent use by others in th e crowd,” see Miss World (UK) \nLtd. v. Mrs. America Pageants, Inc., 856 F.2d 1445, 1449 (9th Cir. 1988) (internal \nquotation marks omitted) (abroga ted on other grounds in Levi Strauss & Co. v. Blue Bell, \nInc., 778 F.2d 1352, 1355  (9th Cir. 1985) (en banc)); see also M2 Software, Inc. v. Madacy \nEntm’t, 421 F.3d 1073, 1088 (9th Cir. 2005) (“Use of similar marks by third-party \ncompanies in the relevant indust ry weakens the mark at issue.”) , it is not clear whether the \n“Fizz” apps in the App Store are actually comm ercial competitors to FSC’s.  See Jacob \nDecl. Ex. 10 (FSC app; “Fizz - #1 Student Money App”; “Fizz – Teen Chat”; “FiiZ Drinks App”; and [the Fizz by Instacart app, which is lis ted as “Fizz: party drinks & snacks”).  “A \ncrowded field of similar marks is only releva nt if there are similar marks on similar \ngoods.”  Internet Specialties v. ISPWes t, No. CV 05-3296 FMC AJWX, 2006 WL \n4568796, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 19, 2006).  Similarly, while a company called ShoulderTap Technologies is apparently i nvolved in a separate lawsuit accusing FSC of trademark \n \n5 Although in September 2024, FSC started to  allow ads on Fizz, the record does not \nreflect FSC’s advertising revenue.   See Solomon Decl. ¶ 27.   Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 12 of 36 \n13 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californiainfringement, its product is a “Fizz” debit card  for college students, which would appear to \nbe very different.  See Jacob Decl. Ex. 28 at 1.  Where the record does not reflect “‘the \nextent of third-party uses . . . [t]he probative value of this ev idence is [] minimal.’”  Palm \nBay Imports v. Veuve Clicquot, 396 F.3d 1369, 1373–74 (Fed. Ci r. 2005) (quoting Han \nBeauty, Inc. v. Alberto-Cu lver Co., 236 F.3d 1333, 13 38 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).  FSC’s \nevidence of commercial strength is therefore no t meaningfully diminish ed by evidence of \nother Fizz apps in the App Store. \nAccordingly, because FSC’ s Marks are conceptually suggestive, and they are \ncommercially strong, FSC’s Marks are strong.   \nb. Similarity of marks \n“‘Similarity of the marks is tested on th ree levels: sight, sound, and meaning.’”  \nEcho Drain v. Newsted, 307 F.  Supp. 2d 1116, 1126  (C.D. Cal. 2003) (quoting Sleekcraft, \n599 F.2d at 351).  “[T]he greater the similari ty between the two marks at issue, the greater \nthe likelihood of confusion.”  GoTo.Com, 202 F.3d  at 1206.  Courts are to consider marks \nin their entireties and as they are encountered in the marketplace.  Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at \n351.  While courts “may give greater weight to a dominant feature of a mark (i.e., that \nwhich is likely to make a great er impression on an ordinary buyer), in the end the court’s \nanalysis must consider and compare the marks in their entirety.”  SG Servs. Inc. v. God’s \nGirls Inc., No. CV 06-9 89 AHM (CTx), 2007 WL 2 315437, at *4 (C.D. Cal. May 9, 2007).  \nAdditionally, “similarities weigh more heavily than differences,” Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at \n351, and “a lesser degree of similarity is required when a trademark holder’s mark is \nstrong,” Pom Wonderful, 775 F.3d at 1130.  \nHere, the analysis differs depending on whether the Court is comparing the word \nmarks or the combined marks.  \nThe parties’ word marks are clearly identical.  Notwithstanding Defendants’ \nreference to its product as “Fizz by In stacart,” it appears on Partiful’s website \nannouncement simply as “Fizz,” the same name as FSC.  See, e.g., Second Solomon Decl. \n(dkt. 47-1) ¶ 23 (“Partiful + Fizz: The Perfect Party Pair.”).

In  addition, Defendants sought trademark protection for the \nstandard character marks around  the word “FIZZ,” apart from an y image, color, or font.  \nId. ¶ 87; Exs. 53, 54.   \nBecause the words are identical , they have the same sight and sound.  They also \nhave, from a consumer perspective, the same meaning.  That FSC chose the word “fizz” \nbecause it evokes dynamic, effervescent campus culture, Solo mon Decl. ¶ 5, and \nDefendants chose the word “fizz” because it “evokes both carbonated beverages and the \nspirited energy of celebrations and special occas ions,” Weintraub Decl. ¶ 17, is irrelevant6 \nif those meanings are not apparent to the consumer.  Even if those meanings were \nsomehow observable to a cons umer, they are not meaningfully different: both rely on the \nword’s reference to bubbles to co mmunicate excitement and energy. \nThe combined marks ar e fairly different, however:       \n \n        \nWhile both promin ently feature the word “FIZZ” in capital, sans serif lettering, and \n(sometimes) blue bubbles around that word, Defendants’ FIZZ mark us es a fatter, rounder \n \n6 The reasons the parties chose their names might of course be relevant to intent. \nCase 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 14 of 36 \n15 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californiafont, in bright yellow with white  bubbles inside the letters, a nd an ombre blue background.  \nFSC’s FIZZ mark uses a skinnier, more a ngular, pale blue-gray font set on a black \nbackground, with a blue-purple bee image above  the word FIZZ (a remn ant of its original \nname, Buzz), and the tagline: “What’s fizzin’ in your community?” below it.  The bubbles \non both are different: Defendants’ are turquoise,  with white circles w ithin, and FSC’s are a \nroyal blue, with more subtle light accents.  Th e colors of the two mark s are not even in the \nsame palate, and are far more distinct than th e maroon colors at i ssue in Pom Wonderful, \n775 F.3d at 1128 (both marks were in “white [font] that is offset by a dark maroon background.”).  Although both include the sa me prominent word and bubbles, the Court \ndoes not find them very similar.  See Vertos Med., Inc. v. Globus Me d., Inc., No. 09-1411 \nPJH, 2009 WL 3740709, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 6, 2009) (“[a] determination that two marks \nare similar in ‘appearance’ esse ntially amounts to an ‘I know it when I see it’ analysis.”).  \nThat said, “a lesser degree of similarity is re quired when a trademar k holder’s mark is \nstrong.”  Pom Wonderful, 775 F.3d at 1130. \nBecause the word marks are id entical but the combined marks are fairly different, it \nbecomes all the more import ant how customers encounter the two brands in the \nmarketplace.  See Sleekcraft, 599 F.2d at 351.  FSC asserts that “consumers typically \nengage with brand names thro ugh text-based formats—search  results, push notifications, \nand word-of-mouth referrals.”  Second Solomon Decl. ¶ 22.  True, the way that some \ncustomers initially hear about the two apps might be through the media, and in that case the identical word marks wo uld be significant.  See Dreamwerks, 142 F.3d at 1131 \n(explaining that the “man-in-the-moon Drea mWorks logo, when pr esented in the full \nregalia of a movie trailer, is quite distinctive” but that “‘DreamWorks’ often appears in the general press and in Industry magazines without the logo”).  However, unlike in \nDreamwerks, the competing products here are apps, which customers must download to \nuse.  The way that customers learn more abou t the apps and download  them is through the \nApp Store.  Jacob Decl. Ex. 30 .

Ex. 10.  While FSC’s  app and Defendants’ app both  bear the name “Fizz,” the \ntext following the colons on both apps are different—“Your Authentic Community” versus \n“party drinks & snacks”— and the images to the left of those names are very different.  \nSee id.  The marks in that context are not confusing at all.  But see Talent Mobile Dev., \nInc. v. Headios Grp., No. SA CV  16- 464-DOC (DFMx), 2017 WL 6940548, at *6–7 \n(C.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2017) (holding, where apps had very different logos, that because marks often appeared without logos, “the difference in logo design is insu fficient to remove a Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 16 of 36 \n17 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of California\nlikelihood of confusion.”).   \nDefendants argue, too, that FSC uses the bumblebee logo  and not the word “fizz” \non the FSC app’s home page.  Opp’n at 10 (c iting Jacob Decl. Exs. 30,  17); see also Jacob \nDecl. Ex. 28 at 8 (FSC stating in other litigati on that “[T]he app’s main feed page … uses \nthe Fizz Social bumblebee logo an d not the FIZZ mark at all.”).  FSC maintains that this is \nnot true as to the app’s home page, whic h when opened, initially shows a blue-purple \nscreen with the bee image and, at the bottom in sans serif, a ll capital, white letters, the \nword FIZZ.  See Reply at 9; Second Solomo n Decl. ¶ 7.  Once the FSC app is open, \nalthough the main image is th e bee and then the name of the FSC community (for example, \nStanford) the tabs at the top are labeled “Top,”  “Fizzin’,” and “New,” as shown below:   \n \n        \n  \nSolomon Decl. ¶ 37.  So FSC’s app does use the word “fizz,” but this use is not very \nsimilar to Defendants’ use, and the bee image is more dominant than  the word “fizz.”   \nSimilarly, while both parties own webs ites that employ the word “fizz,” see \nwww.fizz.social (FSC’s website, with a black background, skinny, sans  serif, blue-purple \nword “FIZZ,” which directs viewers to download the FSC app on the App Store); \nwww.fizz.com (Defendants’ website, with a royal blue background and the yellow, round, sans serif “FIZZ” word with th e bubbles in it, which also dire cts viewers to the App Store), \nthose websites differ visually, and both direct  consumers to the App Store, where the \nabove differences are apparent.  See Solomon Decl. ¶ 91.  Those differences work to dispel \nthe confusion that might occur simply with th e word “fizz.”  See Arcona, Inc. v. Farmacy \nBeauty, LLC, 976 F.3d 1074, 10 80–81 (9th Cir. 2020) (“no reasonable consumer would be \nconfused” where “the packaging,  size, color, shape, and all ot her attributes—other than the Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 17 of 36 \n32 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californiatargets “the college demographic” and so consumers might believe that FSC is embracing “alcohol-centric social facilitation.”  Id.  This  argument is not grounded in evidence.  See \nHerb Reed Enters., 736 F.3d at 1250 (“court’s pronouncements [must be ] grounded in . . . \nevidence. . . .”); Wells Fargo & Co. v. ABD Ins. & Fin. Serv s., Inc., No. C 12-3856 PJH, \n2014 WL 4312021, at *10 (N.D . Cal. Aug. 28, 2014) (requiring evidence of harm to \nreputation, brand, or goodwill and not mere platitudes or conclusory assertions of harm).  Here, the evidence is that Fizz by Instacart “does not target  college campuses” and has a \npolicy of “not delivering alcoho l to college campuses.”  Weintraub Decl. ¶ 40.  Instacart \nalso has a policy of not delivering to college campuses even if the person ordering is over \n21.  Id.  While, as discussed above, it is po ssible to circumvent that policy, FSC’s three \ndeclarations of individuals who did so repr esent a very small sample size and do not \ndemonstrate that Fizz by Instacart does a notabl e amount of business delivering alcohol to \ncollege campuses.   \nFSC’s arguments about loss of control an d alcohol are therefore unpersuasive.  \n2. Market position, strategic growth, and investor confidence \nA defendant’s use of another’s mark that threatens a loss of prospective customers \ncan also amount to irreparable harm.  See Newmark Realty Capital, Inc. v. BGC Partners, \nInc., No. 16-cv-01702-BLF, 20 17 WL 8294175, at *23–24 (N.D . Cal. Nov. 16, 2017).  In \nNewmark Realty Capital, for example, Judge Freeman held that “numerous third-party \ndeclarations” from the plaintiff about how the defendant was soliciting clients, as well as an SEC form showing th at the defendant acquired a major competitor of the plaintiff’s and \nplanned to use it to provide services that competed with the plainti ff further threatened a \nloss of potential customers and demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm.  Id.  Here, \nFSC asserts that Defendants’ use of its FI ZZ marks disrupts FSC’s market position, \nthreatens its business relationships and invest ment prospects, and hampers its strategic \ngrowth in a way that money co uld not remedy.  Mot. at 12. \nFSC has some evidence on this point, but it is  paltry.  It relies on a single investor \nexpressing confusion about Fizz by  Instacart.  See Mot. at 13;  Reply at 14; Solomon Decl. Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 32 of 36 \n33 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of California¶ 73 (“After Instacart launched its Fizz app, one of said potentia l investors texted me about \nwhat he believed was a partne rship between my company and Instacart.”).  But even that \nsingle investor did not express a disinteres t in doing business with FSC.  See Solomon \nDecl. ¶ 73 (“Hi Teddy!  Really enjoyed our catch up a couple of w eeks ago.  Looking fwd \nto more conv later this summer.  Btw this is you partnering w Instacar t, right?”).  FSC has \nnot demonstrated how Defendants are thereby “damaging Fizz’s ability  to secure funding \nand partnerships, or media positio ning and coverage.”  See Mot.  at 13.  Courts have found \na similar lack of evidence inadequate.  See, e.g., Puma SE  v. Forever 21, Inc., No. CV17-\n2523 PSG E, 2017 WL  4771003, at *4 (C.D. Cal. June 2, 2017) (“because Puma has \nadduced no evidence  that its brand value has been diminished or that monetary damages \nare insufficient . . . Puma has fa iled to meet its burden of showing that it will likely suffer \nirreparable harm if a preliminary injunction is not issued.”). \nFSC’s arguments about the market position,  growth and investor confidence are \ntherefore largely unpersuasive. \n3.  Fizz.com \nUse of another’s mark in one’s domain name or metatags18 can also lead to \nirreparable harm, by diverting would-be customers to the in fringer’s website.  Brookfield \nCommc’ns, 174 F.3d at 1054–61 (discussi ng domain names), 10 61–67 (discussing \nmetatags).  FSC argues that Instacart’s ownershi p of fizz.com “gives it control of the most \nintuitive domain associated with the FIZZ brand, and that consumers looking for FSC “will be diverted to Defendants’ competing product.”  Mot. at 13.  FSC of fers no evidence that \nthis is so.  As Defendants poi nt out, such evidence could ta ke the form of “user surveys, \nweb traffic analysis, or even anecdotal examples  of users unable to find Fizz Social.”  See \nOpp’n at 14.   \nFSC insists that “[i]t is undisputed that  consumers search for ‘Fizz’ or visit \n \n18 “[M]etatags are HTML code not visible to  Web users but used by search engines in \ndetermining which sites correspond to the keyw ords entered by a Web user.”  Brookfield \nCommc’ns, 174 F.3d at 1061 n.23.   Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 33 of 36 \n34 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of California‘fizz.com’ expecting to reach [FSC’s] Fizz Platform, and Defendants’ identical infringing \nFIZZ mark creates an obvious  risk of misdirection and co nfusion.”  Reply at 14 (citing \nBrookfield Commc’ns, 174 F.3d at 1062 for the proposition that “even a different domain \nname could cause ‘initial intere st confusion’”).  But the issue in that portion of Brookfield \nCommunications, 174 F.3d at 1062, was that  “[w]eb surfers looking for Brookfield’s \n‘MovieBuff’ products who are taken by a sear ch engine to ‘westcoastvideo.com’ will find \na database similar enough to ‘MovieBuff’ such that a sizeable number of consumers . . . \nwill simply decide to utilize We st Coast’s offerings instead.”   In contrast, no consumer \nwould go looking for FSC’s Fizz platform (in order to anonymously post things about his or her campus community, or read others’ pos ts), get diverted to Fizz by Instacart’s \nfizz.com website (which directs viewers to download Defendants’ a pp under the tagline \n“Drinks, snacks, & friends.  Order together.  Pa y your share.”), and th en decide to stay \nthere because of the convenience of Defendan ts’ “competing product.”  See Mot. at 13.  \nThe two apps do not compete.   \nBecause FSC has not identifie d any evidence that Defenda nts’ use of the fizz.com \nwebsite will cause it irreparable harm, FSC’s argument about that website are unpersuasive. \nFSC has therefore failed to demonstrate irreparable harm. \nC. Balance of Equities \nA party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish th at the balance of equities \ntips in their favor.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  Indeed, if a party only raises serious \nquestions going to the merits but  demonstrates “a hardship bala nce that tips sharply” in its \nfavor, and satisfies the other tw o Winter elements, it is entitled to a preliminary injunction.  \nSee Alliance for Wild Ro ckies, 632 F.3d at 1131–32.  FSC argues that if the Court does \nnot grant an injunction, FSC faces “reput ational damage, consum er confusion, and \npotential market exclusion,” but if the Court doe s grant an injunction, Defendants will only \nsuffer minimal hardship, as they would just need to rebrand a new app.  Mot. at 14.  FSC \nadds that “any hardship that De fendants may experience is self -inflicted.”  Id.; 2Die4Kourt Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 34 of 36 \n35 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californiav. Hillair Cap. Mgmt., LLC, 692 F. App’x 366, 369 (9th Cir. 2017) (holding where \ninfringer complained that “it lik ely will be forced to shut down,” that “when the harm \ncomplained of results from a defendant’s allegedly infringing conduct, we have nonetheless approved the entry of  a preliminary injunction.”). \nFSC’s argument relies on premises that the Court has already rejected—that FSC \nhas met its burden in demonstr ating that consumers will be confused, or that FSC will \nsuffer irreparable harm in the form of reputa tional or market damage.  Defendants, on the \nother hand, argue convincingly that the harm  to Instacart from an  injunction would be \nsignificant, as it has already invested in branding and advertising for Fizz by Instacart, cross-promotion with other apps, and search engine marketing.  See Opp’n at 14 (citing \nWeintraub Decl. ¶¶ 27–29).  It has spent mone y to promote the brand on top of the money \nit spent to develop the app itself.  See Weintraub Decl. ¶¶ 28, 60.19  Moreover, there would \nbe consumer confusion if Fizz by  Instacart changed its name:  \n \nExisting users would suddenly see a new app on their devices that they did not recognize.  Many would likely simply delete it.  Likewise, when existing users next tried to open the Fizz by Instacart app, they would find that it had disappeared. . . . \nWhen new users tried to find the Fizz by Instacart app, they would find nothing. . . . [the] word-of-mouth momentum would \ncontinue for some time, but it would now harm Instacart rather than help it, because the Fizz by Instacart app would no longer exist.  \nWeintraub Decl. ¶ 60.  In addition, “the im pression of instability [created] would cause \nfurther competitive harm and w ould be exploited by Instacar t’s competitors.”  Id. ¶ 62. \nFSC has failed to demonstrate that th e balance of equities tip—sharply or \notherwise—in its favor.   \nD. Public Interest \nFinally, a party seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate that an \n \n19 This fact undercuts FSC’s suggestion that Defendants’ investment was only building the \nFizz by Instacart app over the existing Instacart grocery delivery e-commerce platform.  See Reply at 15.  No doubt a significant percentage of Fizz by Instacart’s “development” \nwas on the technology side, but Defendants also  point to evidence of their marketing \nexpenditures.  Case 3:25-cv-03995-CRB     Document 56     Filed 07/14/25     Page 35 of 36 \n36 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court \nNorthern District of Californiainjunction is in the public inte rest.  See Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  FSC argues that the public \ninterest favors an injunction because Defe ndants’ use of the FIZZ mark will cause \nconfusion and disrupt the market.  Mot. at 14.  Of course, the public has an “interest in \nprotecting trademarks.”  Brookfield Commc’ns, 174 F.3d at 1066; Stark v. Diageo Chateau \n& Estate Wines Co., 907 F. Supp. 2d 1042 , 1067 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (“[p]reventing \nconsumer confusion serves the public in terest.”).  But because FSC has failed to \ndemonstrate a likelihood of confusion, there is no “significant th reat to the public interest \nin the absence of injunctive relief.”  See G ood Meat Project, 716 F. Supp. 3d at 806; see \nalso Internet Specialties W., Inc. v. Milon-Di Giorgio Enters., Inc., 559 F.3d 985, 993 (9th \nCir. 2009) (recognizing that “the usual public  interest concern in trademark cases” is \n“avoiding confusion to consumers.”). \nFSC has failed to demonstrate that an injunction is in the public interest. \nIn conclusion, then, because FSC is not lik ely to succeed on the merits and is not \nlikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief, and because the balance of equities does not favor FSC and the public  interest would not be served by an \ninjunction, injunctive relie f is not appropriate.  \nIV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, the court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of WEX Inc., preventing HP Inc. from using the \"WEX\" trademark in connection with their new \"Workforce Experience Platform\" software, citing likely trademark infringement. AI and automated systems are involved in the contested software and in WEX Inc.'s services, as both use AI for data insights and analytics, though in different business domains.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether HP's use of the trademark \"WEX\" for its software product infringes on WEX Inc.'s existing trademarks, thereby causing consumer confusion and potential harm to WEX Inc.'s brand.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that WEX Inc. is likely to succeed on the merits of its trademark infringement claim. It issued a preliminary injunction restraining HP from using the \"WEX\" trademark, determining that the similarities between the marks could cause consumer confusion and result in irreparable harm to WEX Inc.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you've got a popular lemonade stand called \"WEX Lemonade,\" which is super well-known in your neighborhood. One day, someone else sets up a new stand just down the street and calls it \"WEX Lemonade\" too, but they sell some fancy gadgets instead. People might think you're selling gadgets now or confuse the two stands, which could hurt your business. The judge says that's not fair and tells the other stand they can't use the same name until we figure out if it’s okay in the end.",

T he plaintiff  asks the c ourt to enjoin the defendant  from using  \nany allegedly infringing mark for the duration of this litigation.  Applying the First \nCircuit’s criteria for assessing likelihood of consumer confusion, the Court determines \nthe plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits because the  marks at issue are nearly \nidentical, the products are similar, the parties use the same marketing terms to promote the products , the plaintiff’s mark s are  strong, and the plaintiff has put forth \nconvincing evidence of actual confusion.  The c ourt also con cludes the plaintiff would \nsuffer irreparable harm absent an injunction because the defendant’s allegedly \ninfringing product is scheduled to launch before this case can proceed to trial , thereby \nrunning the risk of saturating the market with potential infr ingement  and depriving \nthe plaintiff of control over its brand and goodwill .

Accordingly, the defendant may not use “WEX”  for the duration of this \nlitigation.  \nI. PROCEUDRAL BACKGROUND \n On April 11, 2024, W EX Inc.

(collectively, HP) , \narising out of the impending launc h of HP’s “Workforce Experience Platform,” \nbranded as “WEX. ”  Compl.  (ECF No. 1).

Id.     \n HP spent approximately nine months considering how to brand HP WEX.  Id.  \n¶ 12.

Legal Standard  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) provides:  \nThe court may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining \norder only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court \nconsiders proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any part y \nfound to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.  The United States, its officers, and its agencies are not required to give security.  \n“The purpose of such a bond is to ensure that the enjoined party may readily be \ncompensated for the costs incurred as a result of the injunction should it later be \ndetermined that it was wrongfully enjoined.”  Axia NetMedia Corp. v. Mass. Tech. \nPark Corp. , 889 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 2018) ; see also Edgar v. MITE Corp. , 457 U.S. \n624, 649  (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring) (“ Since a preliminary injunction may be \ngranted on a mere probability of success on the merits, generally the moving party \nmust demonstrate confidence in his legal position by posting bond in an amo unt \nsufficient to protect his adversary from loss in the event that future proceedings prove \nthat the injunction issued wrongfully.  The bond, in effect, is the moving party’s \nwarranty that the law will uphold the issuance of the injunction”).   \n Although the First Circuit observed that “there is ample authority for the \nproposition that the provisions of Rule 65(c) are not mandatory and that a district \ncourt retains substantial discretion to dictate the terms of an injunction bond,” Int’l \nAss’n of Machinist s & Aerospace Workers v. E. Airlines, Inc. , 925 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir. \n1991), district courts in this circuit, as a general rule, require bond to be posted in \ntrademark infringement cases.  See 7 -Eleven , 60 F.

Feb. 24, 2017) (“The Court has discretion to determine the \namount of the security”).  In setting the amount of bond, courts typically take into \naccount “the potential incidental and consequential costs as well as [] the losses the unjustly enjoined or re strained party will suffer during the period the party is \nprohibited from engaging in certain activities.”  W\nRIGHT , MILLER & KANE, supra, § \n2954.  With respect to trademark cases in particular, relevant considerations include \nthe cost of rebranding and lost sales.  See Polar Corp. , 789 F. Supp. 2d at 240.   \nIn its opposition, HP asks that WEX be required to deposit a bond in the \namount of $2,500,000 if the Court grants WEX’s motion for preliminary injunction.  \nDefs.’ Opp’n  at 20.  At oral argument, the Court sought to ascertain WEX’s position \non HP’s bond request, which WEX outlined in a written memorandum submit ted on \nJuly 1, 2024, following oral argument.  Pl.’s Suppl. Notice at 1-2.   \nIn its supplemental filing, WEX avers that “HP’s request for a bond in the \namount of $2.5 million is not supported by the evidence (or any citation to authority \nin this Circuit su ggesting such an amount is appropriate in this trademark Case 2:24-cv-00121-JAW   Document 48   Filed 07/09/24   Page 81 of 84    PageID #:\n<pageID>82 \n infringement action). ”  Id. at 1.  In WEX’s view, “HP’s request overstates the potential \nharm” because “no changes to the underlying HP product or its functionality would \nbe necessary to comply with WEX’s proposed injunction.”  Id.   In other words, WEX \nsubmits that “the only cost HP would be required to undertake following an \ninjunction would be selecting a new name .”  Id.   WEX further suggests that HP’s \n“digital advertisements can be easily updated w ith a non- infringing name,” hard -copy \nmaterials “can simply be stored while the case proceeds,” and HP “does not have any \nproduct that would need to be sequestered or destroyed.”  Id.  at 2.  All told, WEX \nsubmits “that a bond in the amount of $50,000 (repr esenting 20% of the total c ost to \nHP of its original branding work) would be a more than generous estimate of the costs HP is likely to incur in selecting and implementing a new, non -infringing name for \nits software, and in making the necessary changes to HP’s digital advertising \nmaterials.”  Id.    \nHP disagrees.  Defs.’ Suppl. Notice at 1-3.  HP “respectfully requests that \nPlaintiff provide security of no less than $2,500,000 due  to the costs and damages HP \nwill incur if it is wrong ly enjoined.”  Id.  at 1.  After citing caselaw in which courts \nhave imposed substantial bond requirements, HP says it has invested $14,000,000 \ninto the HP WEX product.  Id.   HP writes that should the Court  issue a preliminary \ninjunction, HP will not only lose its investment in the “WEX” mark, but also spend at \nleast $500,000 to find and adopt a new brand.  Id.  at 1-2.  After analyzing applicable \nand cited caselaw, HP urges the Court to conclude that it has a right to use the “WEX” \nmark.  Id.  at 2-3.

Discussion  \nApplying First Circuit law, even if the Court has the discretion not to order a \nbond, it is appropriate to impose a bond requirement against WEX since it is apparent \nHP will incur damages as a result of the preliminary injunction.  The record contains \nonly general assertions by HP as to the costs it will incur if it is required to rebrand \nits program.27  The Court discounts as hyperbole HP’s contention that its “investment \nin HP WEX would be was ted” if a preliminary injunction were wrongfully issued .  \nDefs.’ Suppl. Notice at 1.  Although HP’s investment in the name “WEX” would be \nwasted, its $14,000,000 investment in the underlying program, the heart and \nstrength of the new product, will remain u naffected.  Nevertheless, it is inarguable \nthat HP will be required to rebrand its new product in light of the Court’s order, and the only estimate the Court has for the cost of rebranding  is the $500,000 estimate  \nprovided by Dan Salzman, Global Head of HP  Workforce Solutions Marketing.  \nSalzman Decl. ¶ 19.   \nThe Court concludes that the cost of rebranding is the fairest measure of the \nproper amount of bond.  Accordingly, WEX shall be required to post a bond in the \namount of $500,000 within one week of the date of this order.  \n  \n \n27  For example, HP claims it  would need to “spend millions of dollars in affirmative marketing \nand other similar activities to re -brand HP WEX in the minds of potential customers, HP partners, \nmarket analysts, and journalists.”  Salzman Decl.  ¶ 19.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of G.G. v. Salesforce.com, Inc., G.G., a minor who was trafficked for sex through Backpage.com, sued Salesforce under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (18 U.S.C. § 1595), alleging it knowingly benefited from Backpage's illegal activities by providing it with CRM software that facilitated sex trafficking operations. The court granted Salesforce’s motion to dismiss, relying on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online service providers from being treated as publishers of third-party content. The court also concluded that the plaintiffs did not adequately establish Salesforce's direct participation or knowledge of G.G.'s specific trafficking.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Salesforce can be held liable under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act for allegedly benefiting from and supporting Backpage's illegal sex trafficking operations, in light of the protective provisions of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Salesforce is protected from liability under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because Salesforce was deemed an interactive computer service provider, and the claims treated Salesforce as a publisher of third-party content. Additionally, the plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence that Salesforce knew about or participated in the specific trafficking of G.G.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Imagine a company sells a special tool to a business. Someone then uses the business's services in a very bad way, like through ads that should have never been posted. The family of a victim sued the tool-selling company saying the company helped the business do bad things just because they sold them the tool to stay organized. However, the judge said, \"You can't sue the tool seller just because the tool was used poorly; also, there's a special rule that protects them because they're not responsible for what people do with the tool.\"",

(a minor), et al. ,     ) \n      )   Plaintiff s,     )   \n )  No. 20- cv-02335 \n v.      )          )  Judge Andrea R. Wood   SALESFORCE.COM, INC .,    ) \n ) \nDefendants.  ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n \nWhen  G.G. was thirteen years old, she ran away from home and fell into the hands of a \nsex trafficker. Th e trafficker pos ted advertisements for sex with G.G. on the classified ad website \nrun by B ackpage.com (“Backpage”).1 As alleged in the complaint , Backpage did not just allow \nbut encouraged these types of illegal ads, to the point of becom ing a dominant force in online sex \ntrafficking. Beginning in 2013, Backpage contracted with Defendant Salesforce.com, Inc.  \n(“Salesforce”) to provide it with customer relationship management (“CRM”) business software \nand support. Th at relationship allegedly helped grow Backpage’s operations, including promoting \nthe business of sex traffickers . G.G. and her mother, Deanna Rose, (together, “Plaintiffs”) have \nnow sued Salesforce pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1595, alleging that, through its contracts with Backpage,  Salesforce violated the federal anti -trafficking laws by knowingly benefiting from and \nparticipating in a venture that it knew, or should have known, was engaged in illegal sex trafficking. Salesforce has filed a motion  to dismiss the complaint in its entirety  pursuant to \n \n1 The Third Amended Complaint, which is the operative complaint, includes Backpage as a defendant. \nBefore Backpage answer ed the Third Amended Complaint , however, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion \nvoluntarily to dismiss Backpage from this suit. (Dkt. No. 101.) Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 1 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) . (Dkt. No. 63.)  For the reasons given below, the Court \ngrants  the motion. \nBACKGROUND \n \nFor purposes of Salesforce’s motion  to dismiss , the Court accepts as true all well- pleaded \nfacts  in the Third Amended Complaint (“TAC”)  and views those  facts in the light most favorable \nto Plaintiffs  as the non- moving part ies. Killingsworth v. HSBC Bank Nev ., N.A., 507 F.3d 614, \n618 (7th Cir. 2007). The TAC alleges as follows.  \n Backpage was established in 2004 as an online marketplace for various goods and \nservices. ( TAC  ¶ 16, Dkt. No. 62.) Among other things, Backpage allowed classified ads  for sex. \n(Id.) In 2008, Backpage’s primary competitor, Craigslist, made it harder for users to post ads for \nsex on its platform . Capitalizing on the  displaced ad volume, Backpage enter ed into a period of \nexplosive growth, soon bec oming the most popular online classified site for adult advertisements \nand deriving the vast majority (up to 99%) of its revenue from such ads. ( Id. ¶¶ 16, 23–24.)  \n Salesforce is the world’s top CRM platform , selling software to help companies manage \ntheir relationships with customers, improve profitability, and streamline processes. ( Id. ¶¶ 29–30.) \nSpecifically, Salesforce sells “software as a service” (“SaaS”) technology consisting of  a set of \napplications that, among other things, can help businesses manage sales and marketing functions, \nassist with customer service and support, provi de customer data integration and support, permit \nboth internal communications and communications with customers, offer business intelligence analytics, and process other forms of data. ( Id. ¶ 31.) The Salesforce platform also has a \n“customer org”—that is, a portal that  serves as a point of interaction between Salesforce and its \ncustomers. ( Id. ¶ 32.) The customer org is confidential to each Salesforce customer and consists of Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 2 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n that customer’s users, data, and automation. ( Id.) Additionally, to help its customers achieve their \nbusiness goals, Salesforce also provides personalized support. ( Id. ¶ 33.)  \nAs Backpage grew, it required more support and better CRM tools and capabilities to keep \nup with customer demand and scale its platform. ( Id. ¶ 35.) To meet this need, Backpage \ncontracted  with Salesforce in 2013. ( Id. ¶ 37.) As set forth in the Master Service A greements \nbetween Salesforce and Backpage, Salesforce retained the right to delete or restrict access to \nBackpage’s customer org if Backpag e’s actions or content was tortious. ( Id. ¶ 47.) During their \nnegotiations in November 2013, Backpage’s C hief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Carl Ferrer and \nanother high- level executive met with a c ertified Salesforce C onsulting P artner to assess \nBackpage’s needs and goals as a business  and to determine how Salesforce could help. ( Id. ¶ 53.) \nAn in -house Salesforce account e xecutive continued those conversations, which eventually \nculminated in a deal  between the companies . (Id. ¶ 54.) O ver the next five years, Salesforce sold \nBackpage access to several products , including the premium “Enterprise Edition” of its CRM \nsoftware . (Id.) An in-house Salesforce executive recommended the Enterprise Edition, which is \ndescribed as “fully customizable.” ( Id. ¶ 45.) And, in 2015, Salesforce provided the technological \ninfrastructure for Backpage to move its business overseas, allegedly to help it evade law enforcement scrutiny in the United States. ( Id. ¶ 46.) Overall, Backpage purchased a new \napplication, requested support, or renewed a contract with Salesforce  on at least five occasions . \n(Id. ¶ 48.) Each of those times, Backpage consulted with Salesforce about how best to assess and \nmeet its operational needs. ( Id.) \nUsing the sophisticated CRM  tools, as well as platform support , provided by Salesforce, \nBackpage was able to scale its operations  and expand its business . (Id. ¶¶ 39 –42.) The nature of \nthose operations —and Salesforce’s knowledge of them —are at the center of the present lawsuit. Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 3 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n Plaintiffs allege that Backpage was  primarily (or even solely ) a sex -trafficking business. As  early \nas 2008, Backpage had been publicly identified by law enforcement and state and federal officials \nas being associated with sex trafficking. ( Id. ¶ 18.) And over the next decade, Backpage faced \ncalls to remove its adult services section  by, among others, a group of state attorneys general . \nBackpage refused, resisting efforts to shut down its site on First Amendment grounds. ( Id. ¶ 21.) \nYet, even in the midst of persistent controversy and allegations regarding sex trafficking on Backpage, Salesforce continued to provide software and support to Backpage throughout this period. ( Id. ¶ 50.)  \nEventually, Backpage and its corporate leadership faced federal criminal charges. ( Id. \n¶¶ 25–26.) Backpage’s CEO pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to facilitate  prostitution \nusing a facility in interstate or foreign commerce and engage d in money laundering, while the \ncorporation pleaded guilty to conspir ing to engage in money laundering. ( Id. ¶¶ 25 n.17, 26 n.18; \nsee also Plea Agreement, United States v. Ferrer , No. 2:18- cr-00464 -DJH (D. Ariz. Apr. 5, \n2018); Plea Agreement, United States  v. Backpage , No. 2:18- cr-00465- DJH (D. Ariz. Apr. 5, \n2018.) As part of its  plea agreement  with the government , Backpage admitted to having operated \nas a site for the sale of illegal sex and to receiving benefits from the sex trafficking of minors. ( Id. \n¶¶ 26–27.)  \nG.G. was one of those sex- trafficking victims. In 2016, when she was thirteen years old, \nG.G. ran away from home  and was soon picked up by her trafficker . (Id. ¶¶ 74, 76.) While \nsearching for her daughter, Rose found an ad featuring G.G. on Bac kpage’s Escort Page. ( Id.) \nRose notified Backpage that G.G., a child, was being advertised for sex on their website and requested that the ads be taken down. ( Id.) Backpage, however, did not remove the ads and \ninstead merely referred Rose to the National C enter for Missing and Exploited Children. ( Id.) Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 4 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n Although G.G. is no longer under the control of her trafficker, she suffered significant physical \nand emotional injuries as a result of her tragic ordeal and still suffers from the effects of being trafficked at such a young age. ( Id. ¶ 79.) \nDISCUSSION  \n \n To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations \nto “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) \n(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). In evaluating a motion to dismiss, \nthe Court accepts as true all well -pleaded facts and draws all reasonable inferences from those \nfacts in the plaintiff’s  favor. Bell v. City of Country Club Hills , 841 F.3d 713, 716 (7th Cir. 2016). \nWhile a complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, there “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 545.“A claim has facial \nplausibility when the pla intiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft , 556 U.S. at 678. \nFederal law provides for both criminal sanctions against sex traffickers and civil rem edies \nfor victims of sex trafficking. Relevant to this case, 18 U.S.C. § 1591 creates both primary and secondary liability for the sex trafficking of minors, and 18 U.S.C. § 1595 allows any victim of such trafficking to sue for damages. Specifically, § 1595 allows  victims of sex trafficking \nviolations under § 1591 to “bring a civil action against the perpetrator (or whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture which that person knew or should have  known has engaged in an act in violation of [§  1591].” 18 U.S.C. \n§ 1595(a). Beyond the requirement that there be an underlying violation of § 1591, a plaintiff seeking to impose liability under § 1595 must establish that the defendant (1) knowingly benefi ted Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 5 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n from (2) participating in a venture that (3) the person knew or should have known violated \n§ 1591. See M.A. v. Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 959, 969 (S.D. Oh. 2019) . \nHere, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable under § 1591 for the trafficking of G.G. by \nher trafficker as facilitated by Backpage. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that a sex trafficker used ads on Backpage to traffic G.G. , a minor, in violation of § 1591. Plaintiffs fu rther allege that \nBackpage facilitated and assisted the use of its site by sex traffickers  such as the one who \ntrafficked G,G. , and that Salesforce, in turn, helped Backpage expand its business with those sex \ntraffickers. Salesforce asks this Court to dism iss Plaintiffs’ complaint against it for two reasons: \nfirst, Salesforce contends that Plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the affirmative defense to liability \nunder § 1595 provided by § 230 of the Communications Decency Act  (“CDA”) , 47 U.S.C. § 230; \nand secon d, Salesforce argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state an actionable claim under 18 \nU.S.C. § 1595. As the defense under § 230, if applicable, is determinative and would warrant dismissal with prejudice, the Court begins its analysis there.  \nI. Section 230 \nSection 230 acts as a bar against liability for certain types of claims against certain \ndefendants —specifically, it provides that “[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service \nshall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1) . Thus, so long as a defendant can establish that it is (1) a \nprovider or user of an interactive computer service and (2) the claims against it seek to treat it as a publisher of a third party’s content, § 230 will bar those claims. See Chi. Lawyers’ Comm. for Civ. Rights Under Law, Inc. v. Craigslist, Inc., 519 F.3d 666, 671 (7th Cir. 2008) (explaining that “[w]hat §  230(c)(1) says is that an online information system must not ‘be treated as the publisher \nor speaker of any information provided by’ someone else” for purposes of establishing liability). Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 6 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n Specifically in the context of sex trafficking claims, including under § 1595, courts have found \nthat §  230 precludes liability w here the allegations are predicated on the posting of user content —\nthat is, the advertisements trafficking the plaintiffs . See, e.g., M.A. ex rel. P.K. v. Vill. Voice \nMedia Hldgs, LLC , 809 F. Supp. 2d. 1041, 1052, 1056 (holding that § 230 barred claims against \nBackpage because there was “no allegation that Backpage was responsible for the development of any portion of the content  of the [sex trafficker’s] posted ads or specifically encouraged the \ndevelo pment of the offensive nature of that content.”) . Section 230’s protection against such \nclaims, however, is not absolute —as relevant here, Congress amended § 230 through the Allow \nStates and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (“FOSTA”) to explicitly exempt certain kinds of sex trafficking claims. FOSTA, Pub. L. No. 115- 164, 132 Stat. 1253 (2018). As a result , \n§ 230(e)(5)(A) now clarifies that “nothing in this section  . . . shall be construed to impair or limit \nany claim in a civil action brought under [§  1595], if the conduct underlying the claim constitutes \na violation of [§ 1591].”  \nSection  230 functions as an affirmative defense. See, Doe v. GTE Corp., 347 F.3d 655, \n657 (7th Cir. 2003); Bonilla v. Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., No. 20- C-07390, 2021 WL \n5795306, at *4 (N.D. Ill. 2021). Typically, the existence of a potential affirmative defense does \nnot “render the claim for relief invalid,” and “courts should usually refrain from granting Rule 12(b)(6) motions” on that basis . Brownmark Films, LLC v. Comedy Partners , 682 F.3d 687, 690 \n(7th Cir. 2012). However, “[a] n exception applies when the allegations of the complaint set forth \neverything necessary to satisfy the affirmative defense.” Hyson USA, Inc. v. Hyson 2U, Ltd., 821 F.3d 935, 939 (7th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). And courts often address the question of § 230’s applicability on a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Marshall’s Locksmith Serv. Inc. v. Google, LLC , 925 F.3d 1263, 1267 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (affirming dismissal of a complaint on Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 7 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n § 230 grounds and citing cases in which courts had acted si milarly ). As the D.C. Circuit explained \nin Marshall’s Locksmith Service, Inc. , invocation of § 230 immunity in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is \n“[c]onsistent with Congress’ intent to confer broad immunity for the re -publication of third- party \ncontent.” Id. ; see also  Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v. Consumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 254 (4th \nCir. 2009) (“Section 230 immunity, like other forms of immunity, is generally accorded effect at \nthe first logical point in the litigation process.”).  Still, for a defendan t to raise the defense at the  \nmotion to dismiss  stage successfully , “plaintiff[s] must affirmatively plead [themselves] out of \ncourt .” Hyson USA , 821 F.3d at 939 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Salesforce contends that \nPlaintiffs here have done just that, arguing that the allegations of the TAC unambiguously establish that §  230 precludes Plaintiffs’ claims against it and that no exception to § 230’s \nprotections apply.  \nA. Salesforce as an Interactiv e Computer Service  \nFirst, Salesforce asserts that it qualifies for §  230’s protections because it is a provider of \nan “interactive computer service.” Section 230 defines “interactive computer service” as “any information service, system, or access software  provider that provides or enables computer access \nby multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(2). Salesforce argues that it falls under the definition of “access software provider,” which is defined as  “a provider of software (including client or server \nsoftware) or enabling tools which do any one or more of the following: (a) filter, screen, allow, or disallow content; (b) pick, choose, analyze, or digest cont ent; or (c) transmit, receive, display, \nforward, cache, search, subset, organize, reorganize, or translate content.” 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(4).  \nIndeed, applying the plain language of the statutory definition to the allegations in the \nTAC, Salesforce plainly qualifies as an “interactive computer service.” At  oral argument on this Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 8 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n motion, Plaintiffs conceded that Salesforce is a software company, and the complaint alleges that \n“Backpage paid the money that it earned from trafficking to Salesforce in exc hange for the \nSalesforce technology and support necessary for Backpage to operate and expand its business.” (TAC ¶ 77.) Looking further in to details of the complaint, the support Salesforce provided \nBackpage involved the provision of technological capabili ties—specifically , software that \nallowed Backpage employees to analyze and digest customer data as well as applications providing for the transmission of both internal employee communications and external customer outreach and support .\n2 Plaintiffs’ claims  can best be summarized thusly: “Salesforce provided \nsupport to Backpage in the use of [Salesforce’s sophisticated software and related] technologies and had knowledge of the manner in which Backpage operated with these enhance d capabilities.” \n \n2 The following allegations are representative of how Plaintiffs’ claims against Salesforce are predicated \nupon capabilities pr ovided by Salesforce’s software.  Plaintiffs allege that Salesforce acted:  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, assisting, supporting, and facilitating Backpage with capabilities and support for \ndirect marketing campaigns, coupled with information gathering such as tracking clicks and \ntracking internet activity of the sex traffickers.” (TAC ¶  87(c).)  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, assisting, supporting, and facilitating more personalized outreach with \nautomation using ‘dynamic content’ and automated messaging to target traffickers and sex buyers.” ( Id. ¶ 87(d).)  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, assisting, supporting, and facilitating account planning including customer \nfollow up, account reminders, modification of marketing and sales plans, and cross -function \ncustomer service capabilities to improve outreach and services to traffickers.” ( Id. ¶ 87(h).)  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, a ssisting, supporting, and facilitating a custom Application Programming \nInterface (API) for use by Backpage employees, which is a software intermediary that allows two \napplications to talk to each other. This capability was for use by Backpage and did not enable \ncomputer access by the public or non- Backpage personnel.” ( Id. ¶ 87(i).)  \n \nBy “[p]roviding, assisting, supporting, and facilitating efficiency enhanced with automation, such \nas cutting the time it takes to email and nurture leads, scoring leads usin g customer parameters set \nby the customer using artificial intelligence (AI) and handling customer questions using \nautomation such as chatbots.” ( Id. ¶ 87(o).)  \n \nWhat all these allegations have in common is that they describe capabilities provided by Salesf orce’s \nsoftware and utilized by Backpage rather than actions  taken by Salesforce itself.   \n Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 9 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n (TAC ¶ 87(b) .) Put differently, Salesforce, through its software, provided multiple users access to \na set of enabling tools that allow those users to analyze, organize, arrange, transmit, and display \ncontent  provided by a third- party (here, Backpage). This description, which aligns with the \nstatutory definition, unambiguously establishes that Salesforce is an “interactive computer service.”  \nNonetheless, Plaintiffs argue that Salesforce has not establish ed that it is an interactive \ncomputer service because i t was not involved in the management of content posted to Backpage. \nInstead, Plaintiffs contend, Salesforce only managed relationships between Backpage and its customers —most of whom, Plaintiffs maintain, were sex traffickers. But managing those \nrelationsh ips did require Salesforce to analyze content —content provided by Backpage  about its \ncustomers. ( See, e.g., TAC ¶  87(f) (alleging that Salesforce “provid[ed], assist[ed], support[ed], \nand facilitat[ed] surveillance and analysis of customer and user activit y with regard to access to \nads”).)  \nTo avoid this result , Plaintiffs ask the Court to read an additional  requirement in to the \nstatutory definition of interactive service provider. Specifically, Plaintiffs appear to take the position that § 230 only covers providers who host publicly accessible platforms. Salesforce’s applications, of course, were only available internally to Backpage employees. But nothing in either the statutory text or case law  support s this vie w. It is true, as Plaintiffs note, that §  230 most \ncommonly has been applied to bar  liability for defendants who host public platforms. See, e.g., \nBennett v. Google , LLC , 882 F.3d 1163, 1167–68 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (applying § 230 to bar claims \nagainst a public internet search engine); Klayman v. Zuckerberg , 753 F.3d 1354, 1356–58 (D.C. \nCir. 2014) (applying § 230 to bar claims against a social networking website). But the mere fact that the defendants that have successfully involved § 230 to avoid liability have been  publicly Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 10 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n accessible does not mean that such accessibility is a statutory requirement. See, e.g., Fields v. \nTwitter, Inc. , 217 F. Supp. 3d 1116, 1128 (N.D. Ca l. 2016) ( “[A] number of courts have applied \nthe CDA to bar claims predicated on a defendant’s transmission of nonpublic messages, and have \ndone so without questioning whether the CDA applies in such circumstances.” (citi ng cases) ), \naff’d on other grounds , 881 F.3d 739 (9th Cir. 2018) ).  \nZango v. Kaspersky Lab, Inc., 568 F.3d 1169 (9th Cir. 2009), to which both Plaintiffs and \nSalesforce cite, is instructive . In Zango, the plaintiff “propose[d] a gloss on ‘interactive computer \nservice’ that would construe a computer service as ‘interactive’ only if it enables people to access the Internet or access content found on the Internet.” Id. at 1175. Based on that construction, the defendant, which distributed malware software, would not fall under § 230’s definition. Id. at 1172. The Ninth Circuit , however, “decline[d] to read the statute so narrowly,” explaining that, \n“[a]s written, §  230 does not limit the definition of ‘interactive compute r service’ to services that \nprovide access to the Internet; rather, its singular requirement is for ‘access by multiple users to a \ncomputer server.’” Id. at 1175–76 (quoting § 230(f)(2)). Th e Court finds this analysis persuasive. \nAfter all, if an interacti ve computer service  is defined as  “includ ing specifically a service or \nsystem that provides access to the Internet,” it is not necessarily  limited to such services. 47 \nU.S.C. § 230(f)(2). And  in any event, as alleged, Salesforce does  provide access to its applications \nthrough the Internet. ( See TAC ¶  45 n.20 (citing to “Sales Cloud Pricing” when describing the \nsoftware edition used by Backpage) .) \nStill, Plaintiffs insist that because Salesforce was not involved in managing the content \nunderlying their claims —the ads posted on Backpage by G.G.’s sex trafficker —§ 230’s \nprotections cannot apply to Salesforce . According to Plaintiffs’ reading, § 230’s references to \n“content” must be understood not as content generally but rather as the content underlying the Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 11 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n claim against the defendant. Using this logic, Backpage, as the actual host of the content in \nquestion, would be considered a provider of interactive computer services, while Salesforce, whose applications supported Backpage’s internal operations, would not. But the text of § 230 imposes no such requirement —an interactive computer service must simply permit users to \ninteract  with content , without any reference to wh at content. Without a textual basis or supporting \ncase law, t he Co urt declines to impose unilaterally a requirement that whether a defendant is an \n“interactive computer service” under §  230 depends  on the nature of the claims against it.  \nPlaintiffs further assert  that, at the very least, it is too soon to decide the issue of whether \nSalesforce qualifies as an interactive computer service. Plaintiffs contend that even if the Court is unable to hold that Salesforce is not  an interactive computer service as a matter of law, discovery \nis still necessary to resolve the question of whether Salesforce  in fact  is  one. But the allegations \nof the complaint make clear that Salesforce’s technology allows users (Backpage employees) to manipulate content in a variety of ways , including by analyzing and organizing customer data and \ntransmitting messages between Backpage and potential customers. When questioned during oral argument about the benefits of allowing limited discovery on this issue, Plaintiffs suggested that it could provide more insight into w hat Salesforce’s software was doing. Yet the Plaintiffs already \nhave provided a thorough overview of Salesforce’s technology in the TAC , suggesting that they \nare already well -acquainted with the capabilities of the software. Similarly, the TAC contains \ndetailed factual allegations regarding discussions between Salesforce and Backpage executives , \nincluding quotations from emails between Backpage and individuals associated with Salesforce. Given the detailed allegations already contained within the complaint,  as well as Plaintiffs \ninability to specify how discovery would shift the analysis, the Court finds it possible to rule on \nthis issue without further inquiry.  Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 12 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, the Court holds that , as a matter of law \nbased on the allegations of the TAC , Salesforce is an interactive computer service.  \nB. Salesforce as a Publisher  \nSection 230 does not, however, provide a complete defense for any type of claim against \nan interactive computer service. Craigslist , 519 F.3d at 669–70 ( explain ing that “ § 230(c)  as a \nwhole cannot be understood as a general prohibition of civil liability for web- site operators and \nother online content hosts ,” and noting, as an example, that defendants may be liable for claims \nlike “contributory infringement if their system is designed to help people steal music” ). But if \nSalesforce can be liable only in a capacity as a publisher, then § 230 applies. Id .; see also City of \nChi. v. StubHub! Inc., 624 F.3d 363, 366 (7th Cir. 2010) (finding that a claim seeking a judgment \nthat a ticket reseller was responsible for collecting state taxes did not implicate §  230 because the \ntax in question “[did] not depend on who ‘publishes’ any information or is a ‘speaker’”) . Whether \na claim treats a defendant as the publisher of third -party content “ does not depend on the form of \nthe asserted cause of action; rather, it depends on whether the cause of action necessarily requir es \nthat the defendant be treated as the publisher or speaker of content provided by another.” Jane \nDoe No. 1 v. Backpage.com LLC , 817 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2016) (citing cases); see also Cohen v. \nFacebook, Inc., 252 F. Supp. 3d 140, 156 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (explaining that §  230 “ is implicated \nnot only by claims that  explicitly point to third party content but also by claims which, though \nartfully pleaded to avoid direct reference, implicitly require recourse to that content to establish liability or implicate a defendant’s role, broadly defined, in publishing or excluding third party [c]ommunications”).  \nHere, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable for harm caused to G.G. by her trafficking \nvia ads posted on Backpage. In Salesforce’s view, this is a straightf orward example of a claim Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 13 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n treating a defendant as a publisher; after all, Plaintiffs are attempting to hold Salesforce \nresponsible for the harmful effects of third -party content posted online. For their part, Plaintiffs  \nargue that because Salesforce, even if it is an interactive computer service, did not make any \ndecisions regarding the editing, monitoring, or publishing of the harmful advertisements, it is not being treated  as a publisher. Plaintiffs suggest that Salesfo rce should have monitored Backpage’s \nuse of Salesforce’s tools and deleted or restricted access to its software in response to illegal activity —in other words, that Salesforce acted as publisher regarding Backpage’s content on \nSalesforce’s own applications . (See TAC ¶  47.) And at least some of Plaintiffs ’ claims relate to \nBackpage’s use of Salesforce’s CRM software to engage in online marketing communications with sex traffickers to expand Backpage’s customer base. ( See TAC ¶¶ 87(c), (g), (h), (k).) But \nthose claims would also treat Salesforce as a publisher, as courts have consistently found that § 230 bars imposing liability on a provider of messaging or e -mail services for content and \nactivities conducted via those services. See Fields , 217 F.  Supp. 3d at 1127–29. \nPlaintiffs’ remaining allegations can be summed up thusly: Backpage, far from acting as a \nneutral platform for advertisements, actively sought out sex traffickers. To do so, Backpage worked with the sex traffickers to ensure that the advertisements, including those featuring G.G., were “sanitized” to hide their illegality. And Salesforce, even though it was aware that \nBackpage’s business model was based on sex trafficking, provided tools and support for those tools to help Backpage e xpand its customer base. But while Plaintiffs, perhaps recognizing that  \nthe claims at their core rest upon the publication of an advertisement, repeatedly emphasize Salesforce’s actions  in their briefing , the TAC itself does not suggest that  Salesforce ever took \nany actions regarding the harmful advertisements or the sex traffickers. ( See TAC  ¶ 40 \n(“Salesforce provided personalized support for the technological tools and instruments that made Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 14 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n it possible for Backpage  to engage in the internet based on- line selling of sex, sex trafficking, and \ncompelled prostitution.” ) (emphasis added ).)3 Put simply,  Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable \nfor the fact that Backpage used Salesforce software to cultivate sex traffickers as customers and \ngrow the website’s reach among sex traffickers, ultimately resulting in the posting of the advertisement  featuring G.G. This is a quintessential claim covered by §  230: it seeks to impose \nliability on an interactive computer service for third -party content that was published on an online \nplatform.  \nThe Court’s finding does not, as Plaintiffs suggest, abandon the statutory language of \n§ 230 by asking not whether the claims treat Salesforce as the “publisher or speaker” of third -\nparty content but whether the third -party content is a “necessary part” of the facts. Plaintiffs rely \non Doe v. Internet Brands  for the  proposition that “the CDA does not provide a general immunity \nagainst all claims derived from third -party content.” 824 F.3d 846, 853 (9th Cir. 2016). But  \nInternet Brands  itself makes clear that applying § 230 to Plaintiffs’ claims does not contradict  this \nprinciple. In Internet Brands , the defendant was the operator of a networking web site for models. \nId. at 848. Somehow, through an outside source, the defendant became aware of two men that \nwere using the site to prey on women. Id.  at 849. The plaintiff, one of the women victimized by \nthose men, sued  the website owner for failing to warn users about the presence of predators on its \nsite and the risk of being victimized . Id. In finding that § 230 did not apply to preclude liability, \nthe Ninth Circuit emphasized that , while the publishing of the plaintiff’s data on the networking \nwebsite was a but -for cause of her injuries, in many ways “publishing activity is a but -for cause of \n \n3 It might be the case that Backpage should be held “liable for creating and posting, inducing another to \npost, or otherwise activel y participating in the posting” of the harmful statement. Huon v. Denton, 841 \nF.3d 733, 742 (7th Cir. 2016). But there is no allegation that Salesforce  ever solicited advertisements, or \nedited them, or took any action to participate in the posting of G.G.’ s advertisement .  Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 15 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n just about everything” with which the defendant website was involved. Id.  at 853. Because the \nplaintiff’s claims were not for any content posted on the website , but rather for a failure to warn in \nwhich the duty breached did not require the defendant to take any action with regards to third-\nparty content posted on its site, the claims did not tre at the defendant as a publisher or speaker of \nsuch content. Id.  at 851.  \nBut here, Plaintiffs seek to hold Salesforce liable for the fact that G.G. was trafficked via \nadvertisements placed on Backpage by her trafficker. Although Plaintiffs try to frame the ir claims \nin terms of Salesforce’s actions (namely, helping Backpage expand the site on which G.G.’s trafficker would eventually place the advertisements trafficking G.G.), Plaintiffs do not contend that they would have a claim against Salesforce regardles s of what was posted to Backpage . See \nJane Does 1 –50 v. Salesforce., No. A159566 at 13–14 (Cal. Ct. App. Dec. 30, 2021) (not \ndesignated for publication) (holding that plaintiffs, alleging they “were injured by online advertising, placed on Backpage by pimps and traffickers, that caused them to enter sex \ntrafficking and be  sexually exploited,” brought claims that “seek to treat Salesforce as the \npublisher of ads created by a third party” and are barred by § 230). Nor can Plaintiffs point to any distinct duty that Salesforce owed to Plaintiffs untethered from the third -party  content. C ompare \nLemmon v. Snap, Inc., 995 F.3d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir. 2021) (explaining that claims for negligent product -design against a mobile app developer sought to “hold [the defendant] liable for its role in \nviolating its distinct duty to design a  reasonably safe product.”) In effect, Salesforce could not \nsatisfy its “alleged obligation” to Plaintiffs without altering either the content generated by Backpage by monitoring the use of its software and forbidding its use in certain ways, or by insistin g that Backpage only hosted certain content on its own site. In other words, Plaintiffs Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 16 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>17 \n claims are predicated on the notion that Salesforce should be held responsible for the existence of \nthird -party content , her adverti sements —that is, they treat Salesfor ce as a publisher.  \nPlaintiffs protest what they deem  an “overbroad” interpretation of § 230. But as the \nSeventh Circuit has recognized, “Section 230(c)(1) is general,” and “a law’s scope often differs from its genesis.” Craigslist , 519 F.3d at 671–72 (applying § 230 to bar claims brought against an \nonline service provider for allegedly violating the Fair Housing Act by posting discriminatory notices). And other courts have applied § 230 to bar claims similar to those here, including claims directly against  Backpage for sex traffickin g on the basis that Backpage’s decisions about various \nposting requirements were done with the express purpose of facilitating sex trafficking. See Jane Doe No. 1, 817 F.3d at 20 –22 (holding that , although the plaintiffs tried to argue that §  230 did \nnot apply “by claiming Backpage’s decisions about what measures to implement deliberately attempt to make sex trafficking easier, this is a distinction without a difference” and finding that the claims  “necessarily treat[ed] the website as a publisher or speaker of content provided by third \nparties , and, thus, are precluded by section 230(c)(1)”).  \nIn fact, it is the very breadth of § 230’s coverage that motivated Congress to pass FOSTA  \nfor the express purpose of pre serving claims such as these by exempting them from the \nprotections of  § 230. See FOSTA, Pub. L. No. 115 -164, 132 Stat. 1253, 1253 (2018) (explaining \nthat “clarification” of §  230 was “warranted to ensure” t hat § 230 did not provide protection to \nwebsites that unlawful ly promote and facilitate sex traffickers). That Congress felt the need to \namend §  230 to include express exemptions for certain sex trafficking claims suggests that such \nclaims would otherwise be covered by § 230. Put simply, courts have coalesced around an understanding of § 230 that “grant[s] sweeping protection.”\n4 Malwarebytes, Inc. v. Enigma \n \n4 In advocating for a narrower reading of § 230, Plaintiffs cite a non -precedential statement by Justice \nThomas in connection with a denial of certiorari in which he suggests that, in an appropriate case, the Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 17 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>31 \n [the defendan t website] not only knew that human trafficking was occurring on its website, but \nthat [the defendant website] was part of an active conspiracy with plaintiff’s traffickers to traffic \nplaintiff ,” and denying a similar motion to dismiss by the defendant hot el where the complaint \nalleged that hotel staff contacted the plaintiff to request that she be more discrete with her activities and that police had spoken with the hotel regarding the plaintiff being a minor (emphasis added)) ; compare Lundstrom v. Choice Hotels Int’l, Inc., No. 21- cv-00619- PAB -SKC , 2021 WL \n5579117, at *8–9 (D. Colo. Nov. 30, 2021) (finding that allegations that a defendant hotel franchisor was “on notice about the prevalence of sex trafficking generally at its hotels and in the hotel indus try” was “not sufficient to show that the defendant should have known about what \nhappened to [the] plaintiff”  and thus could not sustain § 1595 claim).  \nIn short, to bring a claim for liability under § 1595, a plaintiff must plausibly allege that a \ndefenda nt (1) knowingly benefited, either financially or otherwise, from (2) participation in a \nventure, although such participation need not necessarily be direct participation in the sex \ntrafficking, and that (3) the person knew or should have known violated § 1591 as to the plaintiff. \nD. Application to Plaintiffs’ Claims Against Salesforce  \nWith this understanding of the elements for a beneficiary claim under § 1595 in mind, the \nCourt now considers whether Plaintiffs have stated such a claim against Salesforce and concludes that they have not. Specifically, Plaintiffs have failed to allege plausibly that Salesforce knew, or should have known, about G.G.’s specific trafficking or any of the advertisements trafficking her on Backpage. Compare Twitter , 555 F. Supp. 889, 925 (finding that plaintiffs adequately pleaded \na § 1595 claim where they alleged that the defendant website was alerted to the existence of \nvideos involving the plaintiffs and provided evidence that the plaintiffs were underage in response to a requ est for more information). Plaintiffs do not contend that they have pleaded such Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 31 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>32 \n knowledge, instead relying on their argument that § 1595 does not require that Salesforce have \nany knowledge or involvement as to G.G’s specific trafficking. But, as has alrea dy been \ndiscussed, this Court disagrees with that approach and finds that § 1595 requires a defendant to have participated in a venture that the defendant knew or should have known was involved in sex trafficking of the plaintiff , not sex trafficking more generally. Thus, because Plaintiffs have not \nalleged that Salesforce had actual or constructive knowledge of G.G.’s trafficking, they have not adequately pleaded that element of a §  1595 claim.  \nPlaintiffs also have not adequately alleged that Salesforce “participated” in the venture \nwith Backpage that trafficked G.G. C onsidering the TAC as a whole, Plaintiffs allege that \nBackpage used Salesforce’s CRM software to cultivate and expand a customer b ase of sex \ntraffickers, including G.G.’s  trafficker . At times, the TAC appears to suggest that Salesforce itself \ntook actions to assist Backpage’s efforts. ( See TAC ¶  41 (“Salesforce was the driving force that \nenabled Backpage t o scale its operations and i ncrease the trafficking conducted on Backpage.”).) \nBut the factual allegations directly underlying these claims make it clear that Salesforce provided the technology (and corresponding technological support) that Backpage utilized to grow its own business. ( See Id. (“By providing technology, implementation skills, and ongoing support that all \nconstitute affirmative acts by Salesforce that encouraged the wrongdoing in which Backpage.com was engaged.”).) In other words, while Salesforce may have provided the tools that Backpage \nused to build a business based on sex trafficking, Salesforce did not take part in the construction of the business itself.  \nAllegations concerning Salesforce’s role in marketing Backpage to sex traffickers \nillustrate how the actions Pl aintiffs allege Salesforce took to assist and support Backpage in its sex \ntrafficking venture are, in actuality, actions that Backpage took using Salesforce ’s CRM software. Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 32 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>33 \n The TAC describes Salesforce’s CRM technology as providing companies “access to a \ncoordinated set of applications tailored to its business model, including applications \nthat . . . manage all marketing functions.” ( Id. ¶ 31.) Plaintiffs then allege that Salesforce \n“facilitat[ed] and provid[ed] support for direct marketing campaigns for Ba ckpage  to expand \nBackpage’s sex trafficking venture.” (TAC ¶  87(c).) But even in this allegation, Plaintiffs \nacknowledge that it is Backpage, not Salesforce, that actually expanded the operations through marketing activities.  ( See also Pls.’ Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss at 25, Dkt. No. 66 (“Among other \nthings, Salesforce facilitated trafficking through Backpage by assisting Backpage in its marketing efforts that allowed Backpage to solicit sex traffickers and their victims .”) The mere fact that \nSalesforce ’s software played a critical role in Backpage’s expansion, indeed, even if such \nexpansion would not be possible without the capabilities provided by that software, is not enough to demonstrate Salesforce’s own participation in any venture w ith Backpage. See United States v. \nPapagno, 639 F.3d 1093, 1098 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (explaining the difference between “assistance” \nand “participation,” noting that insurers who cover operations do not participate in that operation, fans who cheer the home team may help the team win but do not participate in the game, and engineers who design soldiers’ weapons may support the war effort but do not participate in the war). Thus, to the extent Plaintiffs’ claims rest on any actions taken by Backpage using Salesf orce’s software, they have not adequately alleged Salesforce “participated” in any venture.  \nPlaintiffs contend that they have plausibly alleged that Salesforce did not just sell \nBackpage off -the-shelf software but instead also offered Backpage “personalized support.” Yet, \nalthough the complaint contains multiple mentions of Salesforce providing Backpage with “personalized services tailored specifically to the needs of its illegal business,” Plaintiffs provide no examples of these services, or description, or even suggestion, of how Salesforce altered its Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 33 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>34 \n software to better facilitate sex trafficking. (TAC ¶  46.) For instance, Plaintiffs emphasize that \nSalesforce provided technical support in moving some of Backpage’s operations overseas —\nostensibly to help B ackpage avoid U.S. law enforcement. But even assuming that Backpage’s fear \nof criminal liability motivated its desire to have a duplicate copy of its system, the TAC contains \nno facts indicating that Salesforce was aware of this motivation, nor do Plaintif fs explain how, \ngiven that the complaint alleges that G.G. was trafficked on backpage.com (and not any overseas website), this duplicate copy relates to their claims.  \nSimilarly, Plaintiffs point to the allegation that an in -house Salesforce executive \nrecommended that, based on Backpage’s needs (which Plaintiffs assume to be related to sex \ntrafficking and prostitution), Backpage use Salesforce’s Enterprise CRM edition. Plaintiffs emphasize that the Enterprise CRM edition is described as “fully customizable, ” suggesting that \nthis means that Salesforce then took action to tailor the software to better meet Backpage’s needs (which, Plaintiffs allege, were solely related to sex trafficking). Yet the mere fact that the \nEnterprise CRM edition is customizable (that is, capable of being customized) does not, without more, support a reasonable inference that Salesforce actually customized the software to meet Backpage’s needs. In sum, Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts supporting that Salesforce “took part in” Backpage’s sex -trafficking venture.  \nThus, for the reasons stated above,  the Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to state a \nclaim against Salesforce for beneficiary liability under §  1595. If this were the only basis for \ndismissal, the Court would consider dismissal without prejudice to allow Plaintiffs one final opportunity to amend their complaint to state a viable claim.  But as discussed above, the allegations of the TAC establish that Salesforce is entitled to dismissal based on the affirmative Case: 1:20-cv-02335 Document #: 105 Filed: 05/16/22 Page 34 of 35 PageID #:<pageID>35 \n \ndefense in § 230 of the Communications Decency Act as well. Accordingly, the dismissal is with \nprejudice.  \nCONCLUSION \n \nAccordingly, this case is dismissed with prejudice because Salesforce is protected from \nliability under § 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Even if § 230 did not apply, Plaintiffs \nhave failed  to plead adequately the required elements of a claim for beneficiary liability under \n§ 1595. The Clerk will enter final judgment in favor of Salesforce.  \n \nENTERED:  \n \n \n \nDated :  May 16, 2022  __________________________ \n Andrea R.

    "summary": "1. Summary: In this District of New Jersey court case, the United States and the Attorneys General of 20 states alleged that Apple, Inc. engaged in anticompetitive practices to maintain its dominance in the smartphone and performance smartphone markets. The plaintiffs claim that Apple's restrictive policies on app development, particularly regarding super apps, cloud streaming apps, text messaging, smartwatches, and digital wallets, prevent fair competition and lead to the monopolization of these markets. Apple's motion to dismiss the case was denied by the court, allowing the case to proceed to further litigation.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Apple is engaged in anticompetitive practices through its control over software application interfaces and other technologies, thereby violating federal and state antitrust laws by maintaining or attempting to maintain a monopoly in smartphone markets.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court denied Apple's motion to dismiss, finding sufficient evidence in the amended complaint that Apple may have engaged in anticompetitive conduct and maintained monopoly power in the smartphone and performance smartphone markets. The court upheld the plaintiffs' standing to bring the case and found that the allegations of market definition and monopolistic behavior were sufficiently plausible for the litigation to proceed.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: The U.S. government and several states are suing Apple, accusing it of playing unfairly to stay the biggest player in the smartphone space. They say Apple makes it tough for app makers to create programs that work with other devices and even tougher for users to switch away from Apple's products. The judge said they have a valid point, at least enough to let them try to prove it in court, so the lawsuit will continue.",

BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY2\nThe underlying issue in this case is whether Apple has engaged in anticompetitive practices\nin violation of federal and state antitrust laws. Apple is a global technology company\nheadquartered in Cupertmo, California. (Am. Compl. ^ 19). The iPhone, Apple's signature\nproduct, is currently the dominant smartphone in the United States. (Icf. at ^ 20, 165, 172,181).\nAccording to the Amended Complaint, Apple maintains a market share of 65 percent m the\nsmartphone market and 70 percent in the performance smariphone market. (M at ^ 181).\nA. Applets Technology\nTo understand Plaintiffs' theories advanced in the Amended Complaint, the Court first\ndescribes the relevant technology. A smartphone is a type of mobile device that utilizes advanced\nhardware and software components to allow users to \"not only make phone calls, but allow users\nto listen to music, send text messages, take pictures, play games, access software for work, manage\ntheir finances, and browse the internet.\" (Id at ^ 148-49). These functions are provided through\nsoftware applications, also known as \"apps.\" (Id at ^ 158). In order for an app to run on a\nsmartphone, it must communicate with the smarfcphone's operating system (\"OS\") through\napplication programming interfaces (\"APls\"), (M) Apps that inn with a particular smartphone's\nOS are native apps. {Id. at ^ 159). With respect to Apple, apps that run with Apple's iPhone\noperating system (\"iOS\") are considered native. (M) Third-party developers can also use APIs for\nthe iPhone's iOS to create apps for the iPhone. (M at ^158). They can use \"middleware\" software,\nwhich \"provides similar APIs and functionality across a diverse set of operating systems and\ndevices[J\" to create \"cross-platform applications without having to write separate code for\nindividual operating systems or devices.\" (M at ^ 163). However, developers are bound by certain\n2 The following factual allegations are taken from the Amended Complamt that are accepted as true. Sheridan v. NGK\nMetals Corp,, 609 F.3d 239, 262 n.27 (3d Cir. 2010).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 2 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>policies imposed by Apple that allegedly restrict the developer's ability to standardize the app\nacross different OS. (Id. at ^ 41). Thus, the app must be approved by Apple to be published on\nApple's App Store. (Id)\nAccording to Plaintiffs, Apple harms competition by restricting certain cross-platform\ntechnologies that would make it easier for consumers and developers to purchase and develop\nproducts for devices outside of the Apple ecosystem. (M at ^ 41-42, 60-118). Plaintiffs allege\nthese restrictions affect five key categories: super apps, cloud-streammg apps, text messaging,\nsmartwatches, and digital wallets. (Id.)\ni. SuperApps\nA super app is middleware that runs multiple, smaller \"mini programs\" in one app,\neffectively consolidating access to different apps, experiences, content and services. (Id at ^ 61,\n63). By using a super app, consumers do not have to find an app in an app store, download the app,\nset up the app, and continually log into the app for each specific activity or function that they need.\n{Id. at ^ 62, 68). Rather, consumers can simply find, download, set up, and log into one app that\nhosts all the activities and functions that would otherwise require multiple, separate apps. (M)\nSuper apps work by utilizing standard programming languages that enable the app to be used on\n\"any web browser and on any device,\" including an iPhone. (Id. at ^ 61). Developers, therefore,\ndo not need to create apps using a specific device's API. (Id) This access and the functionality of\nsuper apps make them attractive and valuable to users. (M at ^ 62). However, because the same\napp can be accessed on different devices with low switching costs, super apps may decrease a\nuser's dependence on a specific device's operating system. (M at ^ 63, 66). For example, a user\nhas more choices when purchasing a new smartphone if the super app they rely on can be run just\nthe same on any smartphone. (Id. at 1] 64).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 3 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>Plaintiffs allege Apple limits super apps through its App Store Guidelines (M at ^ 67).\nSpecifically, Plaintiffs allege that Apple has \"effectively blocked\" developers from creating apps\nthat host mini programs by (1) requiring apps to display mini programs using text-only lists, (2)\npreventing apps from categorizing mini programs, and (3) blocking mini programs from accessing\nApple's in-app payment system and using other payment systems. (Id. at ^ 67-70).\nit. Cloud StreaminR Apps\nCloud streaming apps allow users to \"run a computaiionally intensive program without\nhaving to process or store the program on the smartphone itself.\" (M at ^ 72). Rather, the\nsmartphone utilizes \"the computing power of a remote server, which inns the program and streams\nthe results back to the phone.\" (M) This allows developers \"to bring cutting-edge technologies\nand services to smartphone consumers—including gaming and interactive artificial intelligence\nservices—even if their smartphone includes hardware that is less powerful than an iPhone.\" (M)\nFor users, the usage of cloud gaming apps would allow for \"rich gaming experiences\" without\nneeding powerful and expensive hardware. {Id.} For developers, cloud platforms can serve as\nmiddleware to develop a single app that works across different smartphone's OS and \"provides\nmore and simpler options for offering subscriptions, collecting payments, and distributing software\nupdates.\" (M at ^ 73). Plaintiffs allege that if Apple permitted cloud streaming apps, it could be\nforced \"to compete more vigorously against rivals\" and reduce users need to purchase expensive\nphones with advanced hardware. (M at ^ 79).\nAccording to the Amended Complaint, Apple has prevented third-party developers from\noffering cloud gaming subscription services as a native app on the iPhone. (M at D 75). Rather,\nApple has imposed upon developers the \"onerous requirement\" whereby any cloud streaming\ngame or update thereto must \"be submitted as a stand-alone app for approval by Apple,\" whichCase 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 4 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>has \"increased the cost of releasing games on the iPhone and limited the number of games\"\ndevelopers can make available to users. (M at ^ 76). Apple also requires developers to expend\n\"considerable time and resources re-engineering apps\" to meet its \"rules and restrictions\" for cloud\ngames. (M at ^78).\niii. Text Messaging\nImportantly, mobile phones allow the exchange of Short Message Service (\"SMS\") text\nmessages between other mobile phones, including smartphones. (Id. at ^ 45, 83). Apple Messages\n(\"iMessage\") is a native app that allows SMS messages to be exchanged between iPhones and\nother mobile phones. (M at ^ 80, 85). SMS, though, does not support modem messaging features\nor over the top protocols (\"OTT\"), like sending large files, editing messages, and reacting with\nicons, and encryption, typing indicators, read receipts, and disappearing messages. (M at fl 83,\n84). With respect to iMessage, Plaintiffs allege Apple designates the APIs needed to implement\nSMS as 'private/\" which prevents third-party developers from combining the \"'text-to-anyone'\nfLmctionality ofSMS with the advanced features of OTT messaging.\" (M at ^ 85). Thus, iMessage\ndoes not allow text messages to be received by or sent to cross-platform messaging alternatives.\n{Id.} Rather, text messages from cross-platform messaging apps can only be received by or sent\nfrom iPhones if all the parties to the text exchange have downloaded the respective cross-platform\nmessaging app. {Id) In contrast, IMessage allows users to send messages to anyone by entering\ntheir phone number because it \"incorporates SMS and OTT messaging.\" (M)\nPlaintiffs allege Apple inhibits developers' ability to provide a quality cross-platform\nmessaging app, as compared to iMessage, by (1) preventing developers from combining SMS with\nOTT, (2) stopping thh'd-party messaging apps from operating in the background, (3) preventing\naccess to video previews before answering a video call, and (4) preventing the use of modemCase 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 5 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>features on text messages sent from other smartphones. (M at ^ 85-90). Plaintiffs further allege\nthat Apple has created barriers in communication between iPhones and other smartphones to drive\nconsumers towards the iPhone and to make it harder for current iPhone users to switch\nsmartphones. (Id, at \\ 90).\niv. Smartwatches\nSmartwatches are wrist-worn devices that allow users to access apps and perform other\nfunctions like responding to notifications, making mobile payments, and tracking health data. {Id.\nat T[ 95). A smartwatch must be paired with a smartphone to optimize its functionality, so it is\nimperative when buying a smartwatch that the user's smartphone is capable of pairing. (Id) Third-\nparty smartwatches are compatible with smartphones by requiring users to download an app to\ntheir smartphone and then connect the app and watch via Bluetooth. {Id. at ^ 97). Apple Watch,\nApple's smart watch, does not have this functionality and can only be paired with an iPhone. {M.\nat ^ 96). However, third-party smartwatches conversely, can pair to the iPhone. (M at ^ 100).\nPlaintiffs allege that once consumers purchase an Apple Watch, they are less inclined to\nswitch to a different smartphone because the Apple Watch is not compatible with other\nsmartphones. (M at ^ 94, 96). According to the Amended Complaint, Apple degrades third-party\nsmartwatohes' functionality through \"its technical and contractual control of critical APIs\" by (1)\ndepriving iPhone users with third-party smartwatches of the ability to respond to notifications, (2)\ninhibiting third-party smartwatches from maintaining reliable connection to the iPhone, and (3)\nundermining the performance of third-party smartwatches that comiect directly with a cellular\nnetwork^, at f( 100-03).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 6 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>v. Digital Wallets\nDigital wallets are \"apps that allow a user to store and use passes and credentials, including\ncredit cards, personal identification, movie tickets, and car keys, in a single app\" and can be used\nfor transactions in mobile apps and websites. (M at ^ 105). According to the Amended Complaint,\nif developers could create cross-digital platforms, users would be able to \"use the same wallet,\nwith the same cards, IDs, payment histories, peer-to-peer payment contacts, and other information\"\namong different devices, thereby making it easier for users to switch smartphones. (M, at 1[ 109).\nApple Wallet, Apple's proprietaiy digital wallet, is on the IPhone and it incorporates Apple\nPay, Apple's proprietary payment system, to <cprocess[] digital payments on the web, in apps, and\nat merchant points of sale. (Id. at ^ 107). It utilizes near-field communication (\"NFC\") hardware\nto provide tap-to-pay. (M at ^ 109). However, Plaintiffs contend that Apple exerts its smartphone\nmonopoly by precluding banks, merchants, and other parties from using NFC to facilitate tap-to-\npay and the ability to \"develop[] better payment products and services for iPhone users.\" (Id. at ^\n111-12).\nBeyond not allowing others to utilize NFC, Apple impedes and undermines the capabilities\nof digital wallets by restricting others from offering the ability to authenticate digital payment\noptions during online checkouts, thereby limiting third-party wallets' ability \"to provide a simple,\nfast, and comprehensive solution to purchasing.\" (Id. at ^j 116). Further, Apple blocks other digital\nwallets from serving as an alternative in-app payment, which prevents these wallets from\nimproving users' experiences by including \"use of rewards points in purchasing, digital receipts,\nreturns, loyalty programs, and digital coupons for purchases of relevant subscriptions and digital\ngoods.\" {M. at T| 117).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 7 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>B. Procedural HistoxT\nOn March 21, 2024, Plaintiffs initiated this antitrust action against Apple. {See ECF No.\n1). On June 11 , 2024, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint which added Indiana, Massachusetts,\nNevada, and Washington as Plaintiffs and a claim for relief under Tennessee state law. (See\ngenerally Am. CompL). In total, the Amended Complaint raises seven claims for relief; (1)\nmonopolization of the performance smartphone market in the United States (First Claim for\nRelief); (2) attempted monopolization of the performance smartphone market in the United States\n(Second Claim for Relief); (3) monopolizatlon of the smartphone market in the United States\n(Third Claim for Relief); (4) attempted monopolization of the smartphone market in the United\nStates (Fourth Claim for Relief); (5) violation of the New Jersey Antitrust Act, NJ. Stat. Aim. §\n56:9-1, etseq. (Fifth Claim for Relief); (6) violation of the Wisconsin Antitrust Act, Wis. Stat. Ch.\n133.03., efseq. (Sixth Claim for Relief); and (7) violation ofthe Tennessee Trade Practices Act,\nTenn. Code Ami. § 47-25-101, ef seq. (Seventh Claim for Relief). (See jd)\nOn August 1, 2024, Apple filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint pursuant to\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 86) (\"Br.\"). Plaintiffs opposed the motion\n(ECF No. 106) (\"Opp'n), to which Apple replied. (ECF No. 169) (\"Reply\"). This matter is now\nripe for consideration.3\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) governs motions to dismiss for \"failure to state a\nclaim upon which relief can be granted.\" For a complaint to survive dismissal under the Rule, it\nmust contain sufficient factual matter to state a claim that is plausible on its face. Ashcroft v. Iqbal^\n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Ati. Corp. v. Twombty, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). A claim\n3 The Court has also considered Plaintiffs' notice of supplemental authority (ECF No. 255) and Apple's response\nthereto. (ECF No. 258).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 8 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>is facially plausible \"when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\" Id. Although the\nplausibility standard \"does not impose a probability requirement, it does require a pleading to show\nmore than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\" Connelly v. Lane Constr.\nCorp., 809 F.3d 780, 786 (3d Cir. 2016) (citation modified). As a result, a plaintiff must \"allege\nsufficient facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will uncover proof of [his or] her\nclaims.\" M at 789.\nIn evaluating the sufficiency of a complaint, district courts must separate the factual and\nlegal elements. Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210-11 (3d Cir. 2009). Restatements\nof a claim's elements are legal conclusions, and therefore, not entitled to a presumption oftmtii.\nBwfch v. Milberg Factors, Inc., 662 F.3d 212, 224 (3d Cir. 2011). The Court, however, \"must\naccept all of the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true[.j\" Fouler, 578 F.3d at 210. Even if\nplausibly pled, however, a complaint will not withstand a motion to dismiss if the facts alleged do\nnot state \"a legally cognizable cause of action.\" Turner v. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., No. 14-7148,\n2015 WL 12826480, at n (D.NJ. Jan. 23, 2015).\nTo determine a complaint s sufficiency, the Third Circuit requires a three-part inquiry: (1)\nthe court must first recite the elements that must be pled in order to state a claim; (2) the court\nmust then determine which allegations in the complaint are merely conclusory and therefore need\nnot be given an assumption of truth; and (3) the court must \"assume the[ ] veracity\" ofwell-pleaded\nfactual allegations and ascertain whether they plausibly \"give rise to an entitlement for relief.\"\nSantiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121, 130 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation modified).Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 9 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>III. DISCUSSION\nApple moves to dismiss the Amended Complaint on multiple grounds. First, Apple\ncontends the monopolization claims fail because the Amended Complaint fails to allege, (i)\nexclusionary conduct and instead only challenges Apple's lawful refusals to deal; (u) substantial\nanticompetitive effects in the smartphone market; or (iii) Apple's maintenance of monopoly power\nin any relevant market* (See Br. at 18-46).4 Second, Apple argues the attempted monopolization\nclaims fail because the Amended Complaint does not plead Apple's specific intent to monopolize\nor a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power. (See id at 46). Third, Apple contends,\neven if the monopollzation and attempted monopolization claims were to survive, the Court must\ndismiss the \"monopoly playbook\" allegations that broadly reference other products and services\noffered by Apple but are unrelated to Plaintiffs theory of harm. (See id. at 46-48). Finally, Apple\nargues the Plaintiff States lack standing to pursue their claims through either their sovereign\ncapacities or under a parens patriae theory. (See id, at 40 n.6). Plaintiffs oppose each of these\narguments. {See Opp'n at 10-40). The Court addresses each argument in turn.\nA. The Amended Complaint Adequately Alleges Monopolixation Claims Under\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act (First and Third Claims for Relief).\n\"Section 2 of the Sherman Act, in what [the Third Circuit] ha[s] called 'sweeping\nlanguage/ makes it unlawful to monopolize, attempt to monopolize, or conspire to monopolize,\ninterstate or international commerce.\"5 Broadcom Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc., 501 F.3d 297, 306 (3d\n4 For sake of clarity, when citing the parties' briefs, the Court cites to the page number listed in the ECF header. If\nthere is no page number listed in the ECF header, the Court cites to the page number listed in the respective document.\n5 Section 2 provides:\nEvery person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspu'e with any\nother person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States,\nor with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be\npunished by fme not exceeding $100,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, $1,000,000,\nor by unprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the\ncourt,\n10Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 10 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>Cir. 2007). A Section 2 monopoly violation consists of two elements: '\"(1) the possession of\nmonopoly power in the relevant market and (2) the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power\nas distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business\nacumen, or historic accident.'\" Queefi City Pizza v. Domino's Pizza, 124 F.3d 430, 437 (3d Cir.\n1997) (quotmgAspe}-t Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Sknng Corp., 472 U.S. 585,596 n. 19 (1985)).\nThe parties dispute whether Plaintiffs have adequately alleged both elements. (See Br. at 18-46;\nOpp'n at 10-37). The Court addresses each element in turn.\n1. The Amended Complaint Adequately Alleges Apple Possesses Monopoly\nPower in the Smartphone and Performance Smartphone Markets.\nThe first element of a Sherman Act Section 2 claim is \"'the possession of monopoly power\nin the relevant market.^ Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 437 (quoting Aspen Skimg, 472 U.S. at\n596 n. 19) (emphasis added). Under Section 2, courts must start by defining the relevant market\nbecause, \"[wjithout a definition of [the] market there is no way to measure [the defendant's] ability\nto lessen or destroy competition.\" Ohio v. Am. Express Co^ 585 U.S. 529, 543 (2018) (quoting\nWalker Process Equip., Inc. v. Food Mack & Chem, Corp., 382 U.S. 172, 177 (1965)); see also\nConcord Assocs., L.P. v. Ent. Props. Tr., 817 F.3d 46, 53 (2d Cir. 2016) (\"[The market definition]\nanalysis is equally applicable to claims made under Section [2] of the Sherman Act, because\n'without a definition of that market there is no way to measure the defendant's ability to lessen or\ndestroy competition.'\" (quoting Xerox Corp. v. Media Scis. Int'l, Inc., 511 F. Supp. 2d 372, 383\n(S.D.N.Y. 2007))); see also Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 435 ('\"[A] plaintiff must identify the\nrelevant product and geographic markets and allege that the defendant exercises market power\nwithin those markets.1\" (quoting Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino's Pizza, Inc.^ 922 F. Supp.\nl5U.S.C.§2.\n11Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 11 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>1055, 1060 (E.D. Pa. 1996)). Accordingly, the Court begins its analysis with a discussion of the\nrelevant markets.\n1, The Relevant Product and Geographic Markets\nApple argues that Plaintiffs' relevant markets - smartphones and performance smartphones\nare not property defined.6 (Br. at 41 n.33). Plaintiffs counter that the Amended Complaint\nadequately pleads United States markets for smartphones and performance smartphones. (Opp'n\nat 11-13). The Court agrees.\nThe relevant market must be a market for particular products or services, the \"outer\nboundaries\" of which \"are determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use or the cross-\nelasticity of demand between the product itself and substitutes for it.\" Brown Shoe Co. v. U.S., 370\nU.S. 294, 325 (1962). \"However, within this broad market, well-defined submarkets may exist\nwhich, in themselves, constitute product markets for antitrust purposes.\" Id. (citing Umted States\nv. E. I. du Poni de Nemow's & Co., 353 U.S. 586, 593-95 (1957). The submarket's boundaries\n\"may be determined by examining such practical indicia as industry or public recognition of the\nsubmarket as a separate economic entity, the product's peculiar characteristics and uses, unique\nproduction facilities, distinct customers, distinct prices, sensitivity to price changes, and\nspecialized vendors.\" M.\n\"In most cases, proper market definition can be determined only after a factual inquiry into\nthe commercial realities faced by consumers.\" Queen City Pizza, 124 F.3d at 436 (citing Eastman\nKodak, 504 U.S. at 482); see also Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Village Supermarkets, Inc., 806\nF.3d 162, 183 (3d Ch\\ 2015) (same). As such, courts typically decline to dismiss antitrust claims\n6 In its reply brief, Apple states that it \"disputes that the complaint defines a proper market but assumes that it has for\nthe purposes of this motion.\" (Reply at 12 n.3). Since Apples' arguments m its moving brief regarding its lack of\nmonopoly power directly reference the relevant markets identified by Plaintiffs, {see Br. at 41, 43), the Court will\naddress whether the Amended Complaint has adequately pled relevant product and geographic markets.\n12Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 12 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>based on failure to plead the relevant market.

Sol., 513 F.3d 1038, 1045 (9th Cir. 2008) (\"[S]ince the validity of the\n'relevant market is typically a factual element rather than a legal element, alleged markets may\nsurvive scrutiny under Rule 12(b)(6) subject to factual testing by summary judgment or trial. )\n(citaiton modified); Netafmi Irrigation, Inc. v. Jain Irrigation, Inc., 562 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 1081\n(E.D. Cal. 2021) (explaining relevant market allegations are often able \"to survive scrutiny under\nRule 12(b)(6)\" because \"relevant market determinations are typically fact-intensive, with actual\n'inquiry into the commercial realities faced by consumers'\" (quoting High Tech. Careers v. Scm\nJose Mercury News, 996 F.2d 987, 990 (9th Cir. 1993))).\nHowever, \"there is no per se rule prohibiting dismissal on this basis, and plaintiffs have\nthe burden of defining the relevant market. Bayer Healihcare LLC v. Second Stone Enters. LLC,\nNo. 24-7618, 2025 WL 1531237, at *6 (D.NJ. May 29, 2025). Dismissal may be appropriate\nwhere a plaintiff: (1) \"fails to define its proposed relevant market with reference to the rule of\nreasonable interchangeabUity and cross-elasticity of demand\"; or (2) \"alleges a proposed relevant\nmarket that clearly does not encompass all interchangeable substitute products even when all\nfactual inferences are granted in plaintiffs favor.\" Queen Cily Pizza, 124 F.3d at 436-37\n(collecting cases). Accepting the factual allegations underlying Plaintiffs' monopolization claims\nas true, the Court must determine whether the alleged markets underlying the Amended Complaint\nare \"implausible.\" Hanover 3201 Realty, 806 F.3d at 183.\nHere, Plaintiffs allege two relevant markets - smartphones and performance smartphones\nthat are differentiated from other types of similar products. (Am. Compl. ^ 164-175). The\nAmended Complaint defines the smartphone market as distinguishable from \"feature phones,\"\nwhich offer \"less capable hardware and software options,\" and other portable devices such as\n13Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 13 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>tablets, smartwatches, and laptop computers, which \"lack the combination of function, size, and\nportability that consumers rely on in a smartphone. (M at ^[172-73).\nWhile Apple argues the performance smartphone market is \"an invented definition\ndivorced from commercial reality that may not even encompass all iPhone models,\" (Br. at 43),\nthe Court disagrees. As alleged in the Amended Complaint, the performance smartphone\nencompasses a narrower product market \"that compete[s] with most iPhones and excludes the\nlowest-end smartphones, which industry participants sometimes refer to as 'entry-leveP\nsmariphones.\" (Id. at \\ 165). As opposed to performance smartphones, entry-level smartphones\nare made with different quality materials with less durability, maintain \"lower-performance\ncomponents,\" and \"lack features such as an NFC antenna that allows consumers to use their phone\nto make payments or access passes for public transit.\" (M at 1[ 168). Further, consumers usually\npurchase performance smartphones \"for use with post-paid service plans that include promotional\ndiscounts to consumers who purchase performance smartphcmes,\" as opposed to entry-level\nsmartphones that generally use pre-paid service plans. {Id. at ^ 169).\nThe Court finds the performance smartphone constitutes a \"distinct submarket[] for\nantitrust purposes,\" which, in construing the factual allegations in a light most favorable to\nPlaintiffs, varies in price and quality from entry-level smartphones. United States v. Bertelsmann\nSE & Co. KGaA, 646 F. Supp. 3d 1,28 (D.D.C. 2022) (collecting cases). Other courts have reached\na similar conclusion. See, e. g.. In fenuitional Boxing Club ofN.Y., Inc. v. U.S., 358 U.S. 242, 250-\n52 (1959) (affirming the district court's finding that \"there exists a separate, identifiable market\nfor championship boxing contests\" as opposed to non-championship bouts (citation modified));\nSyufy Enters, v.

AT&T Corp., 248 F.3d 131, 147 (3d Cir. 2001) (citation modified).\n\"Consequently, the geographic market is not comprised of the region in which the seller attempts\nto sell its product, but rather is comprised of the area where his customers would look to buy such\na product.\" Tzmis Bros. Co., Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 726 (3d Cir. 1991); see also\nUnited States Horticultural Supply v. T^ ^0,,^ Co., 367 F.App'x 305,311 (3d Cir. 2010) (noting\nthe geographic market is based on buyer behavior). The geographic market \"may be local, regional,\nnational or international in origin.\" In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust LWg., 514 F. Supp.\n2d 683, 697 (E.D. Pa. 2007). Plaintiffs bear the burden of proving the relevant geographic market.\nTurns Bros., 952 F.2d at 726.\nPlaintiffs' assertion that the United States serves as the relevant geographic market is\nsupported by factual allegations of consumer behavior. For example. Plaintiffs allege United States\nusers \"demand services offered by U.S. retailers when they purchase a smartphone,\" such as\n\"activating their new device, setting it up, and transferring important content like apps, messages,\nphotos, and video to their new smartphone.\" (Am. Compl. ^ 176). In contrast, if a customer\n15Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 15 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>purchases a smartphone abroad, the smartphone may (i) face compatibility issues with the\ndomestic carrier, (ii) lack \"the necessary radio technology to take advantage of the carrier's highest\nspeed connections,\" (iii) limit the customer from accessing support during set up,\" or (iv) not have\nvalid warranty. (M) Second, if customers purchase the smartphones through a United States\nretailer, they will have access to \"valuable promotions,\" whereas the \"same promotions and free\nfinancing are unavailable to U.S. consumers who purchase their phones in other countries.\" (Id at\n^ 177). Further, numerous \"regulatory requirements\" must be met to enter the smartphone market,\nwhich effectively bars some smartphone makers from offering smartphones to United States\nconsumers. (Id. at ^ 178). Additionally, Plaintiffs allege Apple sets different prices \"for the same\nsmartphone in the United States separately from those in other countries.\" (M at ^ 179).\nAccordingly, the Court finds the Amended Complaint sets forth plausible allegations that the\nUnited States is the relevant geographic market.\n2. Monopoly Power in the Relevant Markets\nHaving found that Plaintiffs have adequately pled relevant markets in the United States,\nfine Court must next determine whether Apple maintains monopoly power in these markets. Apple\nargues the monopollzation claims fail because Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged possession of\nmonopoly power in either the smartphone or performance smartphone market. (Br. at 41-46). In\nopposition. Plaintiffs contend the Amended Complaint adequately pleads that Apple possesses\nmonopoly power in the smartphone and performance smartphone markets through both direct and\nindirect evidence. (Opp n at 13-18).\n\"Monopoly power is the ability to control prices and exclude competition in a given\nmarket.\" Broadcom, 501 F.3d at 307 (citing Vnited States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 US. 563, 570-\n71 (1966). \"If a firm can profitably raise prices without causing competing firms to expand output\n16Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 16 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>and drive down prices, that firm has monopoly power. Id. (citing Hanison Aire, Inc. v. Aerostar\nInf'l Lie., 423 F.3d 374, 380 (3d Cir. 2005)). The plaintiff bears the burden of proving a defendant\nmaintains monopoly power. In re Remeron Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig. , 367 F. Supp. 2d 675,\n679-80 (D.N.J. 2005). Monopoly power may be proven, (1) through \"direct evidence of\nsupracompetitive prices and restricted output\"; or (2) through indirect evidence of \"a dominant\nshare in a relevant market\" and \"significant entry barriers.\" Broadcom, 501 F.3d at 307 (citation\nmodified); see also Mylcm Pharms. Inc. v. Warner Chikott Pub. Ltd Co., 838 F.3d 421, 434-35\n(3d Cir. 2016).\nAs monopoly power may be proven through direct or indirect evidence, the Court first\nfocuses its analysis on whether Plaintiffs have alleged indirect evidence establishing that Apple\nhas monopoly power over the smartphone and performance smartplione markets.\nThe parties dispute what percentage of market share must be pled. {See Br. at 43-44; Opp n\nat 13-14). Apple argues monopoly power has never been found by the Supreme Court with \"'less\nthan 75% market share.'\" (Br. at 43 (quoting Ko/on Indifs. Inc. v. E.I. DuPont de Nemows & Co.,\n748 F.3d 160, 174 (4th Cir. 2014)). Whereas, Plaintiffs assert the Third Circuit has held that\n\"'[ajbsent other pertinent factors, a share significantly larger than 55% has been required to\nestabllsh[] prima facie market power.'\" (Opp'n at 13-14 (quotmg United Slates v. Dentsply Int'l,\n399 F.3d 181,187 (3d Cir. 2005)).\nSpecifically, \"[c]ourts within the Third Circuit have held a defendant has significant market\nshare supporting an inference of monopoly power if the defendant possesses sixty percent or more\nmarket share in the relevant market.\" Royal Mile Co., Inc. v. UPMC, No. 10-1609, 2013 WL\n5436925, at ift30 (collecting Third Circuit cases); see also Federal Trade Comm 'n v. AbbVie Inc.,\n976 F.3d 327, 371 (3d Cir. 2020) (\"A court can infer market power from a market share\n17Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 17 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>Complaint includes numerous statements allegedly made by Apple executives regarding the\nbarriers set in place to maintain its monopoly. (See, e.g., Am. Compl. ^ 65 (alleging an Apple\nmanager stated, \"allowing super apps to become \"the main gateway where people play games,\nbook a car, make payments, etc.' would 'let the barbarians in at the gate.' Why? Because when a\nsuper app offers popular mini programs, ciOS stickiness goes down'\"); id. at \\ 71 (alleging \"Apple\nblocked cloud gaming apps that would have given users access to desirable apps and content\nwithout needing to pay for expensive Apple hardware\" as it feared a world where 'all that matters\nis who has the cheapest hardware' and consumers could 'buy[J a [expletlve] Android for 25 bux\nat a garage sale and . . . have a solid cloud computing device' that 'works fine'\"); id at ^ 91\n(alleging \"Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering explained that supporting [over\nthe top] messaging in [IMessage] 'would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to IPhone families\ngiving their kids Android phones'\"); id, (alleging Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide\nMarketing \"forwarded an email to CEO Tim Cook making the same point: 'moving iMessage to\nAndroid will hurt us more than help us'\"). At this stage, these allegations are sufficient to\ndemonstrate Apple's specific intent to monopolize the smartphone and performance smartphone\nmarkets. See BanxCorp v. Banh'ate Inc., No. 07-3398, 2011 WL 6934836, at *23 (D.NJ. Dec.30,\n2011) (holding that specific intent was demonstrated where statements by Bankrate's Chief\nExecutive Officer acknowledged there were barriers to competition enabling Bankrate to increase\nprices without losing customers).\nFurther, in a footnote, Apple argues Plaintiffs fail to \"allege a dangerous probability that\nApple can exclude Google, Samsung, and its other rivals to achieve a monopoly power.\" (Br. at\n46 n.8). The Court disagrees. When considering the dangerous probability of achieving monopoly\npower, courts \"may consider factors such as 'significant market share coupled with anticompetitive\n29Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 29 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>practices, barriers to entry, the strength of competition, the probable development of the industry,\nand the elasticity of consumer demand' to determine whether dangerous probability was alleged\nin the pleadings.\" Philadelphia Taxi Ass 'n, 886 P.3d at 342 (quoting Broadcom^ 501 F.3d at 318).\nAs discussed supra, the Amended Complaint alleges Apple maintains a market share of 65 percent\nin the smartplione market and 70 percent in the performance smartphone market, imposed several\nbarriers to entry, and has engaged in anticompetitive conduct. At this stage, the Court finds\nPlaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power. Cf.\nBf'oacicom, 501 F.3d at 318 (determining whether there Is a dangerous probability of achieving\nmonopoly power is a \"particularly fact-intensive inquhy\" that \"courts typically should not resolve\nthis question at the pleading stage unless it Is clear on the face of the complaint that the dangerous\nprobability standard cannot be met as a matter of law\") (citation modified).\nAs such, at this stage of the proceedings. Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged attempted\nmonopolization clams. Therefore, the Court denies Apple's motion to dismiss the Second and\nFourth Claims for Relief for failure to plead Apple's specific Intent to monopolize and dangerous\nprobability of achieving monopoly power.\nC. The Plaintiff States' Have Established Parens Patnae Standins to Bring Their\nClaims.\nFinally, the Court considers Apple's assertion that the Plaintiff States lack standing to\npursue their claims in the Amended Complaint, through either their sovereign capacities or under\naparens patriae theory. (See Br. at 40 n.6). In opposition, the Plaintiff States contend the Amended\nComplaint establishes parenspatriae standing. (See Opp'n at 39-40). The Court agrees.\nWhile the Court recognizes that \"'States are not normal litigants for the purposes of\ninvoking federal jurisdiction[,]'\" certain circumstances permitted them to do so. Harrison v.\nJefferson Par. Sch. Bd, 78 F.4th 765, 769 (5th Cir. 2023) (quoting Massachiisefts v. EPA, 549\n30Case 2:24-cv-04055-JXN-LDW     Document 283     Filed 06/30/25     Page 30 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>U.S. 497, 518 (2007)). \"[SJtates have at least four types of interests that, if injured, satisfy\nstanding's first requirement: sovereign, quasi-sovereign, proprietary, or private.\" Id. (citing Alfred\nL. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 601-02 (1982)).

Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 737 (1981) (explaining that, as parens\npafriae, the State \"act[s] as the representative of its citizens . . . where the injury alleged affects\nthe general population of [the] State in a substantial way\"). In Snapp, the Supreme Court identified\nthe following quasi-sovereign interests: \"First, a State has a quasi-sovereign interest in the health\nand well-being—both physical and economic—of its residents in general. Second, a State has a\nquasi-sovereign interest in not being discrimmatorily denied its rightful status within the federal\nsystem.\" 458 U.S. at 607.\nCourts have found states have parens patriae standing to seek protection for antitrust\nviolations. See, e.g,. New York v. Microsoft Corp., 209 F. Supp. 2d 132, 150-52 (D.C.C. 2002)\n(finding \"signiflcantQ hamper[ing] [of] competition\" by a monopolist is enough for Article III\nstanding) (citation modified); In re Ins.

May 6,1993) (\"[A] state may . . . seek mjunctive relief for harm to its general economy that is\ncaused by a violation of federal antitrust law. ).\nApple's reliance on Harrisonv. Jefferson Parfsh School Board \\sm\\sp\\aced. {See Br. at 40\nn. 6). In Harrison, the Fifth Circuit held that Louisiana did not have parens pairiae standing to sue\nJefferson Parish School Board (\"JPSB\"), a board for a school district located in Louisiana, for\nallegedly discriminating against two students. 78 F.4th at 768, 772-74. Unlike the \"classic example\nof suits vindicatmg sovereign interests [such as] those involving public nuisances and economic\ninterests,\" the Court explained Louisiana was \"not asserting a separate injury such as being denied\nits full participation in the federal system, nor d[id] it allege injury to its citizens['] health or\neconomic well-being in a way that also implicates its own interests.\" M at 772-73 (citation\nmodified). Rather, Louisiana's interest was \"wholly derivative of the interests ofJPSB's students.\"\nId, at 773. Since Louisiana failed to show it suffered an injury to a quasi\" sovereign interest, the\ncourt found It lacked standing to maintain its suit in federal court. Id. at 774.\nIn contrast, the Plaintiff States have properly pleaded sufficient injury to their quasi-\nsovereign interests in the economic well-being of their respective states. The Plaintiff States\narticulate their quasi-sovereign interest in \"seek[mg] to enjoin Apple's anticompetitive conduct\nthat entrenches its monopoly over, and drives up prices within, U.S. smartphone markets.\" (Opp'n\nat 39). The Amended Complaint alleges Apple's conduct has affected the \"States' general\neconomies and substantial segments of their residents who use smartphones[.]\" (See, e.g.. Am.\nCompl. ^ 39 (noting Apple's iPhone base totals \"more than 250 million devices in the United\nStates\" and market share is \"over 70 percent of the performance smartphone market and over 65\npercent of the broader smartphone market\"); id. at \\ 198 (\"Apple engages in, and its activities\nsubstantially affect, interstate trade and commerce . . .

Accordingly, the Court finds the Plaintiff States have established their standing to sue\nparens patriae at this stage.\nIV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals dealt with a dispute regarding insurance coverage for alleged violations of Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by Wynndalco Enterprises, facilitated through the use of Clearview AI's facial recognition software. The court determined that the \"violation-of-statutes\" exclusion in Citizens Insurance's policy was ambiguous and thus, Citizens has a duty to defend Wynndalco against the BIPA-related lawsuits. The involvement of AI was significant as the case revolved around Clearview AI's collection and use of biometric data via facial-recognition technology, which was central to the BIPA violations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the insurance policy's catch-all exclusion for violations of statutes unambiguously precludes coverage for BIPA claims, thereby relieving Citizens Insurance Company of its duty to defend Wynndalco.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Seventh Circuit held that the catch-all provision in the insurance policy's violation-of-statutes exclusion was ambiguous. Therefore, Citizens Insurance must provide a defense for Wynndalco in the lawsuits alleging BIPA violations and related common law claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you buy an insurance policy that promises to cover damages for hurting someone's privacy, like sharing their photos without permission. Now, when your company is sued for using an AI to collect people's photos from the internet without asking, your insurance tries to avoid covering it, saying it doesn't have to for laws about privacy. The court checks and says the insurance policy is too confusing about this part, so the insurance does have to help you with the lawsuit.",

Citizens Ins. Co. of Am. v. Wynndalco Enters., LLC , 595 F.Supp.3d 668 (N.D. Ill. 2022). The \nnarrowing construction that Citizens proposes to resolve that ambiguity is not supported by the language of the provision and does not, in fact, resolve the ambiguity. In view of what \nthe district court described as  the “intractabl[e] ambigu[ity]” \nof the provision, Citizens must defend Wynndalco in the two \nclass actions. Id. at 676. \nI. \nThe litigation that has given rise to this coverage dispute \nstems from a massive database of facial -image scans assem-\nbled by Clearview AI, an artificial intelligence firm that spe-cializes in facial recognition software. We accept as true the following factual allegations gleaned from the two com-plaints filed against Wynndalco.  \nClearview AI allegedly has extracted or “scraped” in  ex-\ncess of three billion photographs of individuals from online social media, content- sharing, and digital payment platforms \n(including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Google Photos, LinkedIn, and Venmo); converted those images into biometric facial recognition identifiers us-ing proprietary algorithms; collected the original images and \ntheir biometric counterparts into its database; and paired \nthose images with information as to where those images were found on the Internet. Clearvi ew AI has also created a facial \nrecognition application or “app” that allows a user to identify an individual by uploading a photograph of that person to the app. The app then allows the user to see other photographs of Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 334 No. 22-2313 \nthat same person on the media platforms or websites where \nthey appear, along with the identifying information (includ-\ning their name, address, and other personal information) as-\nsociated with that individual. Thus, a user could take a pho-tograph of a stranger on the street and upload the image  to \nthe app, which converts the photograph into a biometric facial scan, and (assuming the individual’s photos and information are in Clearview AI’s database), determine who that person \nis, and access any number of additional photographs of and \nassociated content (tweets, Facebook and Instagram posts, \nYouTube and TikTok videos, LinkedIn profiles, etc.) created by and about that individual. Clearview AI marketed the app to law enforcement agencies, among others. See Kashmir Hill, \nThe Secretive Company That Might End Privacy As We Know It , \nN\nEW YORK TIMES  (Jan. 18, 2020), available at https://www.ny-\ntimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html? . \nThe Chicago Police Department, through its purchasing \nagent CDW -Government , gained access to the Clearview AI \ndatabase and its facial- identification app by means of a two-\nyear contract between CDW -Government  and Wynndalco.  \nMelissa Thornley and Mario Calderon are the respective \nlead, named plaintiffs in two putative class actions filed on behal f of themselves and other Illinois residents whose facial \nimages have been collected and scanned into the Clearview \nAI database: Thornley, et al. v. CDW -Government, LLC, et al. , \nNo. 2020 CH 04346 (Cir. Ct. Cook Cnty. filed May 27, 2020); \nCalderon, et al. v. Clearview AI, Inc., et al. , No. 1:20- cv-01296- CM \n(S.D.N.Y. filed Jul. 22, 2020). We shall refer to the two suits using their surnames.  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 5 \nWynndalco is an Illinois -based information technology \nservices and consulting firm. The Thornley  and Calderon  com-\nplain ts describe Wynndalco’s relationship with Clearview AI \nin two different ways. According to the Thornley  complaint, \nClearview AI was not able to sell access to its database and \napp directly to the Chicago Police Department because it was not an approved vendor for the department, whereas Wynndalco was an approved vender. Thus, CDW -\nGovernment  contacted Wynndalco and entered into an ar-\nrangement pursuant to which Wynndalco would purchase the product from Clearview AI and then re -sell it to CDW -\nGovernment . Wynndalco proceeded to make the purchase \nfrom Clearview AI in December 2019 for the sum of $47,500, and then immediately re -sold the product to CDW -\nGovernment  for $48,450.00. CDW -Government  in turn re -\nsold the product to the Chicago Police Department for  \n$49,875. By contrast, the Calderon  complaint alleges that \nWynndalco is Clearview AI’s agent and that Wynndalco li-censes and supplies the product to customers on Clearview \nAI’s behalf. The Calderon  complaint alleges that on January 1, \n2020, the Chicago Pol ice Department, through its agent, \nCDW -Government , entered into a two- year, $49,875 contract \nwith Clearview AI.  \nBoth suits allege that Wynndalco’s role in this transaction \nra\nn afoul of BIPA. Illinois became the first state in the nation \nto enact biometric data privacy legislation when it promul-\ngated BIPA. Broadly speaking, BIPA codifies an individual’s right of privacy in and control over his or her biometric iden-tifiers and biometric information. See  Bryant v. Compass Grp . \nUSA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, 621 (7th  Cir. 2020) (quoting Rosenbach \nv. Six Flags Entm ’t Corp. , 129 N.E.3d 1197, 1206 (Ill. 2019)). \n“[The Act] imposes numerous restrictions on how private Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 336 No. 22-2313 \nentities collect, retain, disclose and destroy biometric identifi-\ners, including retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, \nscans of hand or face geometry, or biometric information.

A violation of the statute as t o \none’s biometric information is sufficient in and of itself to ren-\nder an individual an “aggrieved person” entitled to pursue \nrelief; he or she need not suffer an actual injury as a result of \nthe violation. Id. at 1205–07. BIPA currently provides the \nbroad est private right of action among the states that have \nadopted similar statutory protections for biometric data.

The term “b iometric identifier” is  defined \nto include , among other attributes,  “face geometry .” 740 ILCS \n14/10. A second, unjust enrichment count in the Thornley  com-\nplaint alleges that Wynndalco has unjustly benefitted from its publication of the class members’ biometric information, to \nthe detriment of the named plaintiffs and the class. A third, \ninvasion -of-privacy count alleges that Wynndalco’s publica-\ntion and exploitation of the  plaintiff s’ biometric data \namounted to an unauthorized intrusion upon their seclusion, causing them mental anguish .\n3 \nThe first amended complaint in Calderon  includes a single \ncount against Wynndalco.4 It alleges that Wynndalco and its \n \n3 Wynndalco attempted to remove the Thornley  case to federal court, \nbut we affirmed the district court’s assessment that, given the nature of \nthe statutory violations alleged in that case, the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing to pursue relief in a federal forum, and the case was remanded to Illinois  state court. Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc. , 984 F.3d 1241 (7th Cir. \n2021).  \n4 The proposed class in the Calderon  suit is comprise d of all individu-\nals who, while residing in Illinois, had their biometric identifiers or infor-mation captured, collected, or obtained by Clearview AI at any point \n(continued)  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 338 No. 22-2313 \nofficers violated BIPA by capturing, collecting, storing and \nusing the named plaintiffs’ and the other class members’ bio-\nmetric identifiers and/or biometric information without, inter \nalia, their notice and permission in violation of section 15(b) \nof the Act, 740 ILCS 14/15(b). That section provides:  \nNo private entity may collect, capture, purchase, re-\nceive through trade, or otherwise obtain a person's \nor a customer's biometric identifier or biometric in-\nformation, unless it first:  \n    (1) informs the subject or the subject's legally  \nauthorized representative in writing that a bio-metric identifier or biometric information is be-ing collected or stored;   \n    (2) informs the subject or the subject's legally  \nauthorized representative in writing of the spe-cific purpose and length of term for which a bi-ometric identifier or biometric information is being collected, stored, and used; and  \n    (3) receives a written release executed by the \nsubject of the biometric identifier or biometric information or the subject's legally au thorized \nrepresentative  \nAt the time of the sale of the Clearview AI app to the Chi-\ncago Police Department, Wynndalco had business owner’s in-surance coverage through a policy issued to it by Citizens ef-\nfective from October 2, 2019, to October 2, 2020. Secti on II of \n \nduring the five years immediately preceding the filing of the Calderon  \ncomplaint.  \n Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 9 \nthe policy sets forth the liability coverage for the business. \nSection II(A)(1) provides liability coverage for, among other \ninjuries, “personal and advertising injury,” R. 20 -1 at 83, \nwhich section II(F)(14) defines, in relevant part, as an “inju ry, \nincluding consequential ‘bodily injury,’ arising out of one or \nmore of the following offenses: … e. [o]ral or written publica-tion, in any manner, of material that violates a person’s right of privacy.” R. 20- 1 at 100. Citizens does not dispute that \nWynndalco’s  conduct, as alleged in the Thornley  and Calderon \ncomplaints , falls within the policy’s definition of “personal \nand advertising injury.”  But Citizens contends that coverage \nof the Thornley  and Calderon  claims  is barred by a catch -all \nprovision in a  policy exclusion  barring coverage for injuries \narising out of certain statutory violations . The exclusion in \nquestion provides as follows (with the catch -all provision \nhighlighted):  \nThis insurance does not apply to:  \n… \nq. Distribution of Material in Violation of \nStatutes  \n“Bodily injury,” “property damage” or “per-\nsonal and advertising injury” arising directly or \nindirectly out of any action or omission that vi-olates or is alleged to violate:  \n(1) The Telephone Consumer Protection Act \n(TCPA), including any amendment of or addi-tion to such law; or  \n(2) The CAN -SPAM Act of 2003, including \nany amendment or addition to such law; or  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 3310 No. 22-2313 \n(3) The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), \nand any amendment of or addition to such law, \nincluding the Fair and Accurate Credit Tra nsac-\ntion Act (FACTA); or  \n(4) Any other laws, statutes, ordinances, or reg-\nulations , that address, prohibit or limit the printing, \ndissemination, disposal, collecting, recording, send-\ning, transmitting, communicating or distribution of material or information . \nPolicy § II(B)(1)(q) ( bold emphasis in original; italicized em-\nphasis added) , R. 20- 1 at 91–92. Citizens contends that the in-\njury alleged by the plaintiffs in both the Thornley  and Calderon \ncomplaints  constitutes a “personal or advertising injury” that \narises, directly or indirectly, out of a violation of BIPA, which, \nin Citizens’ view, is a “law” or “statute” of the type referenced \nin the catch -all provision set forth in  ¶ 4 of the exclusion .\n5 \nAfter Wynndalco tendered the two complaints to Citizens \nand asked that it supply Wynndalco with a defense, Citizens filed this diversity action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1), \nseeking a declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 \nthat it has no duty to defend or indemnify Wynndalco (or its officers) in either the Thornley  or the Calderon  suit, invoking \nthe catch -all provision of the violation -of-statutes exclusion. \nWynndalco and its officers answered the complaint, denied the allegation that the injuries alleged in the Thornley  and Cal-\nderon  suits were not covered by the insurance policy, and filed \na counterclaim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, Count I of which \n \n5 The catch- all provision in the violation -of-statutes exclusion is the \nsole basis on which Citizens contends it has no duty to defend or indem-\nnify Wynndalco. See R. 20 at 8 ¶¶ 39 –41.  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 11 \nseeks a declaration that Citizens is, in fact, obligated to defend \nthem against the Calder on suit. R. 59 at 27–29. Count II of the \ncounterclaim alleged that Citizens had breached the insur-ance policy by refusing to provide a defense for the Thornley  \nsuit and the Calderon suit and seeks damages, including the \nattorney’s fees and costs Wynndalco has incurred in defend-ing against the two lawsuits. R. 59 at 29 –31. Citizens answered \nthe counterclaim and denied its allegations.  \nOn the parties’ cross -motions for judgment on the plead-\nings, the district court entered judgment for Wynndalco, con-cluding th at the catch -all is facially ambiguous  and therefore \nnot enforceable against Wynndalco. 595 F.Supp.3d 668. The court deemed it so because a literal reading of the expansive wording of that provision would preclude coverage not only \nfor violations of privacy- related statutes like BIPA, but a nu m-\nber of other statutory causes of action that the policy in the \nfirst instance purported to cover, including slander, libel, trademark, and copyright. Id. at 673–74. Given the ambiguity, \nthe court turned to two interpretive canons, ejusdem gen eris \nand noscitur a sociis to determine whether a narrower reading \nof the catch -all might be warranted based on the types of stat-\nutes cited in the exclusionary provisions immediately preced-ing the catch -all. But those canons, the court concluded, did \nnot resolve the ambiguity. In contrast to comparable policy language at issue in West Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Krishna Schaum-\nburg Tan, Inc. , 183 N.E.3d 47 (Ill. 2021), the catch- all could not \nreasonably be interpreted to reach only statutes regulating \nmethods of communication,  given that the statutes specifi-\ncally cited as excluded from coverage were not limited to those regulating communication, as they were in Krishna Tan . \nWynndalco , 595 F.Supp.3d at 674. Citizens proposed that the \nstatutes singled out by name in the exclusion  at issue here all Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 3312 No. 22-2313 \nregulate privacy, but the court pointed out that the cited stat-\nutes regulate different forms of privacy, so there is no true \ncommonality among them suggesting that the catch -all pro-\nvision should be read to reach only injuries resulting from vi-\nolations of privacy- regulating statutes. Id. at 674–75. Conclud-\ning that the catch -all provision was thus “intractably ambigu-\nous,” id. at 676, the district court concluded that Citizens had \nnot affirmatively established that the claims against \nWynndal co were excluded from coverage and held that Citi-\nzens had a duty to defend Wynndalco as to both the BIPA and \ncommon law claims, id.6 \nII. \nWe review the district court’s decision to enter judgment \non the pleadings de novo.  E.g., StarNet Ins. Co. v. Ruprecht , 3 \nF.4th 342, 346 (7th Cir. 2021). In doing so, we apply the same standard that we reference in reviewing a decision to grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief. Mesa Labs., Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 994 F.3d 865, 867 (7th Cir. \n2021) (citing Landmark Am. Ins. Co. v. Hilger , 838 F.3d 821, 824 \n(7th Cir. 2016)). We therefore take the facts alleged in the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and we will sustain the entry of judgment only if it is beyond doubt that the nonmoving party cannot prove facts sufficient to support its position and that the movant is entitled to relief. See id.  (citing Hilger , 838 F.3d at 824) ; see also Scottsdale Ins. Co. \nv. Columbia Ins. Grp., Inc., 972 F.3d 915, 919 (7th Cir. 2020) (cit-ing Housing Auth. Risk Retention Grp., Inc. v. Chicago Housing \n \n6 Count II of Wynndalco’s counterclaim (seeking damages for Citi-\nzens’ refusal to defend Wynndalco) was subsequently dismissed without \nprejudice in order to facilitate the entry of final judgment. R. 121.  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 13 \nAuth. , 378 F.3d 596, 600 (7th Cir. 2004)). For purposes of the \nmotion, the pleadings include not only the complaint, the an-\nswer, and counterclaims, but any written instruments at-\ntached thereto. Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c); see Federated Mut. Ins. Co. \nv. Coyle Mech. Supply Inc., 983 F.3d 307, 312– 13 (7th Cir. 2020); \nAdams v. City of Indianapolis , 742 F.3d 720, 729 (7th Cir. 2014). \nThe parties agree that Illinois law governs  this dispute a nd \nwe have no reason to question them on this point: Apart from \nthe fact that Illinois is the forum state, Wynndalco is an Illinois \nfirm, and the injuries alleged in the two actions for which it seeks a defense arose from Wynndalco’s role in the sale to th e \nChicago Police Department of a product granting access to a database containing biometric identifiers and information be-longing to Illinois citizens. As this is a diversity case, our task \nis to resolve the substantive questions as we believe the Illi-\nnois Supreme Court would do. E.g., Newman v. Metro. Life Ins. \nCo., 885 F.3d 992, 1000 (7th Cir. 2018). To determine whether \nCitizens owes Wynndalco a duty to defend it in the Thornley  \nand Calderon litigation, we compare the allegations of the \nThornley  and Calderon  complaints with the relevant provisions \nof the insurance policy to determine whether the nature of the liability asserted falls within the scope of the policy’s cover-age. E.g., United Fire  & Cas. Co. v. Prate Roofing & Installations, \nLLC, 7 F.4th 573, 579– 80 (7th Cir. 2021).\n7 The duty to defend is \nbroader than the duty to indemnify, id. at 579, so the insurer \nmust supply the insured with a defense so long as the facts \n \n7 Unless otherwise noted, all of the cases cited in this opinion applied \nIllinois law.

Bradley Hotel \nCorp. , 19 F.4th at 1006; Hess, 161 N.E.3d at 187 (quoting Hobbs \nv. Hartford Ins. Co. of Midwest , 823 N.E.2d 561, 564 (Ill. 2005)). \nWe construe the individual provisions of the policy not in iso-lation but as a whole, giving effect to each and every provi-sion whenever possible. E.g., Founders Ins. Co. v. Mu ñoz, 930 \nN.E.2d 999, 1004 (Ill. 2010). Provided there is no ambiguity in \nthe contract terms, we will accord those terms their ordinary meanings and apply the policy language as written, so long as doing so would not conflict with public policy. Clarendon Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Medina , 645 F.3d 928, 933 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing \nHobbs , 832 N.E.2d at 564); Muñoz , 930 N.E.2d at 1004. Absent \nsome indication that the policy’s terms were intended to have  \n \n8 Because we conclude that Citizens does have a duty to defend \nWynndalco, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether Citizens also \nbears a duty to indemnify Wynndalco, a separate question that is gener-\nally considered premature to resolve unless and until the insured is held liable on the claim for which it seeks coverage. See, e.g., Am. Bankers Ins. \nCo. of Fla. v. Shockley , 3 F.4th 322, 331– 32 (7th Cir. 2021).

Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection & Ins. \nCo., 115 F.3d 1312, 1317 (7th Cir. 1997) (collecting cases); see \nalso Muñoz , 930 N.E.2d at 1004.  \nPolicy terms that purport to limit the insurance company’s \nliability are construed in favor of coverage, but only when the terms are ambiguous or susceptible to more than one reason-\nable interpretation. Medina, 645 F.3d at 933 (c iting, inter alia , \nHobbs , 823 N.E.2d at 564). Wherever possible, a court should \nconstrue a policy so as to harmonize its provisions and avoid \nreading an exclusion in such a way that it removes the cover-age explicitly provided elsewhere in the policy. Gen. Agents Ins. Co. of Am., Inc. v. Midwest Sporting Goods Co. , 765 N.E.2d \n1152, 1156 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002) (quoting Lincoln Logan Mut. Ins. \nCo. v. Fornshell , 722 N.E.2d 239, 242 (Ill. App. Ct. 1999)); see also \nPanfil v. Nautilus Ins. Co. , No. 12 C 6481, 2013 WL 6670779, at \n*3 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 18, 2013), j. aff’d , 799 F.3d 716 (7th Cir. 2015); \nPerry v. Fidelity Nat’l Title Ins. Co. , 48 N.E.3d 1168, 1173 (Ill. \nApp. Ct. 2015); Yates v. Farmers Auto Ins. Ass’n , 724 N.E.2d \n1042, 1045 (Ill. App. Ct. 2000); Jones v. Universal Cas. Co. , 630 \nN.E.2d 94, 98–99 (Ill. App. Ct. 1994); Mosby v. Mut. Life Ins. Co. of N.Y. , 92 N.E.2d 103, 107 (Ill. 1950) (“To [imply] in large and \nheavy print that the insurer is liable for total and permanent disability before age sixty, and then in smaller type and stand-\nard inking below to use language which purportedly limits \nthe insure[r]’s liability for total and permanent disability of which proof is made before age sixty  is so misleading as to create \nan ambiguity which must be resolved in favor of the in-sured.”) (emphasis ours). Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 3316 No. 22-2313 \nThe latter point deserves some amplification. In some in-\nstances, the language of a policy exclusion may appear clear \nin isolation, but when compared with a separate policy provi-\nsion granting coverage for the same type of action or injury that the exclusion ostensibly reaches, an ambiguity arises, in that the exclusion appears to take away with one hand cover-age that the policy purports to give with the other. See Panfil , \n799 F.3d at 721–22 (quoting Cherrington v. Erie Ins. Prop. & Cas. \nCo., 745 S.E.2d 508, 526 (W. Va. 2013)); see also Tews Funeral \nHome, Inc. v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., 832 F.2d 1037, 1045 (7th Cir. \n1987) (per curiam), abrogated in part on other grounds, Nat’l Cy-cle, Inc. v. Savoy Reins. Co., 938 F.2d 61, 64 (7th Cir. 1991). The cases sometimes refer to this as the exclusion appearing to “swallow” the coverage that the policy purports to grant the \ninsured. Wynndalco , 595 F.Supp.3d at 673; Fornshell , 722 \nN.E.2d at 242. Because the aim of policy interpretation is to \ngive effect to all provisions of the policy and avoid whenever \npossible construing one provision in a way that tends to nul-lify another provision, a court when confronted with such an \nambiguity m ust consider whether the reach of the “swallow-\ning” exclusion can be deemed more narrow than its plain \nterms taken in isolation would otherwise suggest. Id.; see also \nMidwest Sporting Goods, 765 N.E.2d at 1156–57. If the ambigu-ity cannot be resolved in this  way, it must be construed \nagainst the insurer and in favor of coverage. Panfil , 799 F.3d \nat 721. \nThe plaintiff bears the burden in the first instance of show-\ning that its claim falls within the coverage of the policy.  E.g., \nBradley Hotel Corp. , 19 F.4th at  1006 (citing Addison Ins. Co. v. \nFay, 905 N.E.2d 747, 752 (Ill. 2009). There is no dispute that \nWynndalco has met that burden here. The parties agree that \nthe injur ies alleged in the Thornley  and Calderon  complaints  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 17 \nqualify as  “personal or advertising inj ur[ies]” in that a viola-\ntion of BIPA is a violation of privacy, and the policy defines \n“personal or advertising injury” to include, inter alia , the \n“[o]ral or written publication, in any manner, of material that \nviolates a person’s right to privacy.” Polic y § II(F)(14)(e), \nR. 20-1 at 100. The burden t hus falls on Citizens to affirma-\ntively establish that an exclusion applies.  Id. (citing Fay ). “Ex-\nclusions are read narrowly and apply only if their application \nis clear and free from doubt.” Id. at 1006–07 (cleaned up); see \nalso Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Ocwen Fin. Corp. , 990 F.3d 1073, 1078 \n(7th Cir. 2021) (“a decision to excuse an insurer’s duty to de-\nfend based on an exclusionary clause in the contract ‘must be clear and free from doubt’”) (quoting Evergre en Real Estate \nServs., LLC v. Hanover Ins. Co. , 142 N.E.3d 880, 887 (Ill. App. \nCt. 2019)); Gillen v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 830 N.E.2d \n575, 582 (Ill. 2005) (“a policy provision that purports to ex-clude or limit coverage will be read narrowly and will be ap-plied only where its terms are clear, definite, and specific”) (citing Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, Pa. v. Glenview Park \nDist. , 632 N.E.2d 1039, 1042 (Ill. 1994)).  \nCitizens, of course, argues that BIPA is a statute that falls \nwithin th e violation -of-statutes exclusion’s catch -all provision \nfor acts or omissions that transgress “[a]ny other laws, stat-\nutes, ordinances, or regulations , that address, prohibit, or \nlimit the printing, dissemination, disposal, collecting, record-\ning, sending, transmitting, communicating or distribution of \nmaterial or information ,” (Policy § II(B)(1)(q)(4), R. 20 -1 at 91–\n92) in that BIPA governs the collection (“recording”) as well \nas the sale and transmission ( “dissemination,” “sending,” \n“communicating” and “dis tribution”)  of information, in this \ncase biometric identifiers and information. There is no dispute Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 29 \navoids the problem of the exclusion swallowing the policy’s \ncoverage provisions for “personal and advertising injuries.”  \nYet, as the district court pointed out, the statutes listed in \nthe exclusion encompass two distinct types of privacy: seclu-sion and secrecy. 595 F.Supp.3d at 675; see Am. States Ins. Co. v. Capital Assocs. of Jackson Cnty., Inc. , 392 F.3d 939, 941 (7th \nCir. 2004). Seclusion is the right to be left alone. Auto -Owners \nIns. Co. v. Websolv Computing, Inc., 580 F.3d 543, 549 (7th Cir. \n2009) (applying Iowa law, but referencing Illinois law);  \nKrishna, 183 N.E.3d at 58; Valley Forge Ins. Co. v. Swiderski El-\necs., Inc. , 860 N.E.2d 307, 317 (Ill. 2006); Benitez v. KFC Nat’l \nMgmt. Co., 714 N.E.2d 1002, 1033 (Ill. App. Ct 1999). Statutes \nregulating phone calls, faxes, and emails address that type of privacy by imposing restrictions on these methods of commu-\nnication when the individual has not consented to receive \nthem. See Websolv Computing , 580 F.3d at 549; Capital Assocs. , \n392 F.3d at 941, 942. Secrecy, on the other hand, is the right to maintain the confidentiality of one’s personal information. See Websolv Computing , 580 F.3d at 549; Krishna, 183 N.E.3d at 58. \nThe FCRA and FACTA address the secrecy of one’s credit and other personal identifying information by regulating how that information is reported. See Websolv Computing , 580 F.3d \nat 549; Krishna , 183 N.E.3d at 58. BIPA would fall into this \nsame secrecy -related subset of statutes regulating privacy in-\nterests, as it regulates how one’s biometric information may \nbe collected, retained, and shared with others. S ee Krishna , 183 \nN.E.3d at 58. Our decision in Capital Assoc iates, 392 F.3d at \n941–43, notes the distinctions between these two different \ntypes of privacy and admonishes courts to take care in distin-guishing between them as they evaluate in what sense an in-surance policy may be using the term “privacy.” Thus, only \nby referencing privacy at a high level of generality can one  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 3330 No. 22-2313 \nfind a common thread among these statutes —one that would \nencompass privacy in multiple forms (seclusion in some cases \nand secrecy in oth ers) and addressing distinct interests.  \nWe are not convinced that ejusdem generis can resolve the \nambiguity presented by the exclusion in this way. As we \nnoted earlier, there is nothing in the language of the exclu-sion—be it in the title or in any of the provisions that follow —\nwhich points to privacy as the focus of the exclusion. And a \nproper application of the ejusdem generis canon looks for a \nreadily discernible theme among the specific items cited in a \nprovision that in turn suggests how the broad langu age that \nfollows should be construed. Scalia & Garner, R\nEADING LAW, \nat 199. Here there is no readily discernible theme —certainly \nnothing, as the district court noted in the Cheese Merchants \ncase, that “jumps off the page,” 2022 WL 4483886, at *11, as a \ncommon characteristic uniting the four statutes listed in the \nexclusion, see id., at *11 –*13. True, at a very high level of gen-\nerality, one might describe all four statutes as bearing on in-dividual “privacy,” id.  at *13, but that would not be obvious \nto the type of layperson or business purchasing this policy, given the different ways in which the statutes operate to pro-tect the two distinct categories of privacy interests we have discussed. In this respect, the exclusion here stands in marked contrast to the one at issue in Krishna, where the wording of the exclusion’s heading indicated that it was  statutes regulat-\ning methods of communication that were implicated by the exclusion and the two statutes specifically named by the title fell neatly into that very category of laws. There are no such textual clues to guide the reader to the privacy gloss for which Citizens advocates here. Only by engaging in a relatively so-phisticated and nuanced examination of the four statutes sin-\ngled out by the exclusion and the interests they protect might Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 31 \none be able to identify generic privacy as a theme that unifies \nthose statutes and infer that the catch -all provision, notwith-\nstanding its sweeping language, should be limited to other statutes that likewise address some aspect of personal pri-vacy, be it seclusion, secrecy, or some other form of privacy.\n11 \nThat gives the ejusdem generis canon entirely too much work \nto do.  \nThe noscitur a sociis textual canon fails to resolve the ambi-\nguity posed by the catch -all provision for the same reasons. \n“[T]he principle of noscitur a sociis—a word is known by the company it keeps —[is used] to ‘avoid ascribing to one word \na meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompany-ing words … .’” Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. at 543, 135 S. Ct. at 1085 (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd Co. , 513 U.S. 561, 575, 115 \nS. Ct. 1061, 1069 (1995)); see also Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, \n604, 130 S.

Secrecy and seclusion are the two principal \nmeanings, id., but there are other connotations, including, for example \npersonal autonomy and freedom from government regulation, which may \noverlap with secrecy or seclusion to some extent, but which also reflect distinct interests, see id.

Ct. 1577, 1587 (2010)). \nAs we have discussed, there are no readily -discernible clues \nin the text surrounding the catch -all provision that point to \nprivacy as the factor that harmonizes the catch -all with the \nother provisions of the violation -of-statutes exclusion.  \nConsequently, we return to where we started: On a plain -\ntext reading, the catch -all provision has an extremely broad \nsweep —so broad, in fact, that the exclusion on its face would \neliminate coverage for a number of statutory injuries ex-pressly included in the definition of “personal and advertis-ing injur[ies]” that the policy purports to cover. This clash be-tween competing provisions of the policy gives rise to an am-biguity, one that neither ejusdem generis nor noscitur a sociis can \nplausibly resolve.  We are left with no choice other than to con-\nclude, as did the district court, that the catch -all provision in \nthe violation -of-statutes exclusion is “intractably ambigu-\nous.” 595 F.Supp.3d at 676. Applying yet another well- estab-\nlished canon, we must construe that ambiguity against Citi-zens and in favor of the insured. Panfil , 799 F.3d at 721.  As the \ncatch -all provision says nothing about injuries arising from \nstatutes regulating privacy interests, and the policy defines a covered “persona l and advertising injury” so as to include an \ninjury arising out of the “[o]ral or written publication, in any manner, of material that violates a person’s right of privacy” (Policy § II(F)(14)(e), R. 20 -1 at 100), we conclude that the in-\njuries alleged in the Thornley  and Calderon  complaints at least \npotentially fall within the coverage of the Citizens policy. Cit-izens thus owes its insured, Wynndalco, a duty to defend it against those complaints. Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Shock-ley, supra n.8, 3 F.4th  at 331; Panfil , 799 F.3d at 721–22; Supreme \nLaundry Serv., L.L.C. v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 521 F.3d 743, 749 \n(7th Cir. 2008). This duty extends to the common law claims Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 33 \nasserted against Wynndalco in the Thornley  litigation, which \nas Citizens itself argu es, arise out of the same acts or omis-\nsions as the BIPA claim asserted in that suit. Citizens Br. 42 –\n43. \nHaving come to this conclusion, we need not separately \naddress whether, even if Citizens’ reading of the exclusion \nwere correct, the Thornley  plaintiffs’ claim for a violation of \nsection 15(c) of BIPA, which focuses on profiting  from bio-\nmetric information, f alls outside of the wording of the catch -\nall exclusion.  \nIII. \nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

The product reportedly used AI tools to block cyber threats, but it allegedly failed to perform as promised. The parties reached a settlement of $3,250,000, which the court approved. The proposed settlement was deemed fair, considering the complexities of the case and the potential risks of litigation.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue was whether Intrusion Inc. violated securities laws by making false and misleading statements about its product to inflate its stock price, thus committing fraud on the market.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the settlement agreement as fair, reasonable, and adequate. It certified the class, dismissed the case with prejudice, and awarded attorney's fees and expenses to the lead plaintiff and class counsel.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine your friend's company promised that their new app could block all the bad stuff on the internet because it uses super-smart technology (AI). People got excited and bought lots of shares in the company, making the share price skyrocket. But later, it turned out the app didn't work as well as promised and the share prices dropped. People who lost money sued the company, and in the end, they all agreed on a sum of money ($3.25 million) to settle the case.

Joe Head,1 Gary Davis, and James Gero (collectively, “Intrusion”), \non the other.  \n The Court also GRANTS Lead Counsel’s Motion for Award of Attorneys’ Fees \nand Reimbursement of Expenses. (Dkt.  #66).  \nI. BACKGROUND  \n Bronstein and Intrusion have agreed to settle the  claims  in this consolidated \nclass action for $3,250,000.00. The proposed settlement arises from more than a year \nof litigation surrounding Intrusion’s alleged  efforts to artificially boost its share price \nthrough misrepresentations regarding a new cybersecurity product: “Intrusion \nShield.” After obtaining preliminary approval of the proposed class settlement on \nAugust 17, 2022,  Bronstein and class counsel now seek final approval and an award \nof attorney’s fees and expenses.  \nA. Intrusion’s Efforts to Artificially Boost Its S hare  Price  \n Intrusion is a publicly traded cybersecurity company.  In the summer of 2020, \nit developed a new product that would supposedly “ revolutionize the  [network \nsecurity ] industry. ” (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 58). Intrusion described this new product, Intrusion \nShield, as blocking cyberthreats more effectively  than existing technologies on the \nmarket because it combined state -of-of the -art artificial intelligence tools with a \nproprietary database of 2.7 billion malicious IP addresses. (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶ 46, 58).  \n \n 1 The Amended Class Action Complaint, (Dkt.  #38), names “P. Joe Head” as a \nDefendant as opposed to “T. Joe Head.” This Order references  the Defendant as T. Joe Head \nbecause that is the name used in the Unopposed Motion f or Final Approval of Class Action \nSettlement. (Dkt.  #65).   Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 2 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>3 \n  Intrusion Shield was marketed  through promotional videos  published on the \ninternet , investor calls, government  filings, and press releases. See, e.g. , (Dkt.  #38 \n¶¶ 47–48, 58, 60, 67 ). In one press release, for example, Intrusion announced that \nduring beta testing with thirteen companies  Intrusion Shield had suc cessfully \nblocked  more than 75 million cyberthreats emanating from over 800,000 unique \nmalicious entities. (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 60). In another press release,  Intrusion allegedly  \nasserted  that the product  could prevent “zero -day” attacks: in other words, attacks \nthat exploit previously unknown cybersecurity weaknesses. (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶  42, 65). \n These representations allegedly boosted Intrusion’s stock price to over $28.00 \nper share  by April 2021.  (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 125). But within a few months, Intrusion’s stock \nprice dropped to under $4.00 per share. (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 11). Bronstein alleges that the \nstock price dropped because Intrusion Shield did not perform as investors expected. \nFar from revolutionizing the  industry, it merely repackaged existing products. \n(Dkt.  #38 ¶ 2). And instead of shutting down cyberthreats, it shut down customer \ncomputer networks. (Dkt.  #38 ¶  7). Bronstein also alleges that, based on employee \nreports and third- party research, Intrusion’s representatio ns about the product were \nnot just false but knowingly false and calculated to boost Intrusion’s stock price ahead \nof a potential sale. See, e.g. , (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶ 1, 3, 8, 41, 119– 24).  \nB. The Resulting Class Action Litigation  \n Intrusion’s alleged misrepresenta tions regarding Intrusion Shield gave rise to \ntwo federal securities class actions  in this Court:  one filed in April 2021 , and the other  \nfiled in May of the same year. (Dkt.  #1, #31). After consolidating  these cases , \n(Dkt.  #31),  appoint ing Bronstein  as Lead Plaintiff, (Dkt.  #32 at 6–7), and appoint ing Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 3 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>4 \n The Rosen Law Firm, P.A.  as class counsel  (and Steckler Wayne Cochran Cherry, \nPLLC as liaison counsel),  (Dkt.  #32 at 6 –7), the Court ordered Bronstein to file an \namended complaint. (Dkt.  #37).  \n Bronstein filed the amended complaint  on February 7,  2022 , asserting t wo \ncauses of action under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 : (1) violation of Section \n10(b) against all Defendants; and (2) violation of Section 20(a) against the individual \nDefendants.  (Dkt.  #38).  The amended complaint asserted damages against Intrusion \nunder a “fraud- on-the-market” theory —seeking to hold the comp any responsible for \nartificially  boosting  its share price through alleged misstatements regarding \nIntrusion Shield . (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶  11, 125 –29); see also Halliburton Co.  v. Erica P. John \nFund, Inc. , 573  U.S. 258, 268, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 189  L. Ed. 2d 339 (2014) .   \n Class counsel diligently litigated the case, achieving a proposed class \nsettlement in June 2022.  (Dkt.  #51). Class counsel’s efforts to secure the proposed \nsettlement included an extensive pre- suit investigation, consultations with damages \nexper ts, negotiations with opposing counsel, and participation in a full- day \nmediation.  (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32).   \nC. The Proposed Class Action Settlement  \n The proposed class settlement disposes of all claims in this consolidated class \naction  for $3,250,000.00. The propo sed class settlement value represents 7.61% of the \nmaximum possible damages that could have been recovered at trial , according to \nBronstein’s damages calculations . (Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).   \n The proposed class settlement  disposes of all claims  in this consolidated class \naction  not only between Bronstein and Intrusion, but also between Intrusion and the Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 4 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>5 \n proposed class members. The proposed class includes any  person or entity  who \npurchased (or otherwise acquired)  Intrusion stock between Oct ober 14, 2020,  and \nAugust 26, 2021. (Dkt. #38 ¶ 1). Under the proposed settlement, each class member \nwould receive  a pro rata share of the settlement fund based on the number of shares \npurchased during the relevant period, accounting for both the purchase price and the \nsale price.  (Dkt.  55-1 at 7–10); (Dkt.  #65 at  24).   \n Following  the Court’s  preliminary approval of the proposed class action \nsettlement on  August 17, 2022,  (Dkt.  #56),  Bronstein diligently notified the potential \nclass members of the proposed settlement. P otential class members were notified by \nseveral  methods —including postcard notice , email notice, and a published summary \nnotice2—resulting in delivery of notices to nearly 29,000 potential class members. \n(Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). Over 1,000 potential class members responded to the notice. \nSignificantly, no class members objected to the proposed settlement.  (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 8).  \nAnd only two class members requested exclusion from th e proposed settlement. \n(Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 7). Those two requests are invalid, however, because they did not \ncomply with basic requirements for submitting a request for exclusion. (Dkt.  #72-1 \n¶ 7).    \n Bronstein now moves for final approval of the proposed  class  settlement and \nfor attorney’s fees and expenses.  (Dkt.  #65, #66).  Intrusion does not oppose these \nmotions. The Court held a settlement fairness hearing on November 30 , 2022,  to \n \n 2 These notices were delivered through a third- party administrator. The administrator \nalso maintained a webpage and toll -free line to inform class members of the settlement and \ninstruct them on submitting claims. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶¶ 5 –6).

(Dkt.  #73). No class members appeared at the hearing. The November 9, \n2022,  deadline for objecting to the proposed class settlement or requesting exclusion \nfrom  it has passed. (Dkt.  #56 ¶ 37).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n The Court’s responsibilities in evaluating a class action settlement run not only \nto the named parties, but also to the unnamed class members. The Court must ensure \nthat the class members receive adequate notice of the settlement and an opportunity \nto object or request exclusion from it . FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(1);  Pettway  v. Am. Cast \nIron Pipe Co. , 576 F.2d 1157, 1219 (5th  Cir. 1978) . The Court also must ensure that \nthat the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate” to the class members under \nthe four factors  enumerated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(2) : (1) adequacy \nof the representation,  (2) fairness of the negotiations (i.e., whether  the negotiations \nwere at arm’s length), (3) adequacy of the relief , and (4) equitability of treatment to  \nclass members . The adequacy of relief factor turns on several considerations , \nincluding  the risks of proceeding to trial.3 FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(2)(C).  \n In addition to the nonexclusive Rule 23 factors, courts in this c ircuit  often  \nconsider the Reed  factors in evaluating the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of \na proposed class settlement: “ (1) the existence of fraud or collusion  behind t he \n \n 3 The Rule 23 factors were added by amendment in 2018.

Instead, they were added \nto “focus the court and the lawyers on the core concerns of procedure and substance that \nshould guide the decision whether to approve the proposal .” Id.

Motors Corp. , 703  F.2d 170, 172 (5th  Cir. 1983)  (citations omitted) ; ODonnell v. \nHarris Cty ., No. 16 -CV-1414, 2019 WL 6219933, at *9 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 21, 2019) \n(observing that “courts in this circuit often combine [the Rule 23 and Reed factors] in \nanalyzing class settlements.” ). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n The Court finds that the motion for final approval of the proposed class \nsettlement should be granted. The propos ed settlement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate to the class members. The class members each received adequate notice of \nthe settlement and the settlement will be effectively distributed through the plan of \nallocation. The Court therefore certifies the proposed class, approves the class \nsettlement, and awards Bronstein and class counsel  the requested attorney’s fees and \nexpenses.   \nA. The Proposed Class Settlement Is Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate.  \n The proposed class settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate under both the \nRule 23 and Reed factors.  \ni. Adequacy of Class Representation  \n The record establishes that Bronstein and class  counsel adequately \nrepresented the settlement class in litigatin g this complex securities case and in \nnegotiating the proposed settlement agreement. Bronstein is an Intrusion securities Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 7 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>8 \n investor who suffered the same alleged injuries as the other class members. His \nmotivations are therefore aligned with the other class  members, reducing the \nlikelihood of a conflict of interest. In re Polaroid ERISA Litig. , 240  F.R.D. 65, 77 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2006)  (“Where plaintiffs and class members share the common goal of \nmaximizing recovery, there is no conflict of interest between the clas s representatives \nand other class members.”). Bronstein also actively participated in the case by \ncommunicating with counsel and participating in settlement negotiations , further \ndemonstrating the adequacy of his representation.  (Dkt.  #65-5 ¶¶ 3– 7).  \n Class counsel diligently prosecuted the case on behalf of the class. In addition \nto drafting pleadings and negotiating the settlement agreement, counsel also \ninvestigated the claims, retained a private investigator, consulted with damages \nexperts, drafted deta iled mediation statements, and participated in a full -day \nmediation. (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32). Counsel was competent and informed and ably \nrepresented not only Bronstein, but also the proposed class. See Hays v. Eaton Grp. \nAttorneys, LLC , No. CV 17-88-JWD -RLB, 2019 WL 427331, at *9 (M.D.  La. Feb. 4, \n2019) ( approving class settlement agreement negotiated by “a law firm with \nsubstantial experience in litigating complex class actions ”).  \nii. Arm’s Length Negotiations, Fraud, and Collusion  \n The propos ed settlement agreement is not the product of fraud or collusion; \ninstead, it arises from extensive arm’s length negotiations between sophisticated counsel. The parties entered the proposed settlement agreement after a full -day \nmediation —which  “suggests th e settlement was not the result of improper dealings.”  \nErica P. John Fund, Inc.  v. Halliburton Co. , No. 3:02 -CV-1152- M, 2018 WL 1942227, Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 8 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>9 \n at *4 (N.D.  Tex. Apr. 25, 2018).  The mediator , Jed D. Melnick,  had substantial \nexperience mediating complex securities actions, lending further support to the \nagreement’s legitimacy. See Gordon  v. Vanda Pharm. Inc. , No. 19 -CV-1108, 2022 WL \n4296092, at *4 (E.D.N.Y.  Sept. 15, 2022) (holding that mediation conducted by Jed D. \nMelnick, “a highly qualified mediator [,] strongly supports a finding that the \nnegotiations were conducted at  arm’s length without  collusion ”); In re China Med. \nCorp. Sec. Litig. , No. 8:11 -1061- JLS, 2014 WL 12581781, at *5 (C.D.  Cal. Jan.  7, 2014) \n(“Mr. Melnick ’s involvement in the settlement supports the argument that it is non -\ncollusive.”). In any event, the Court may presume the absence of any fraud or \ncollusion when, as here, no evidence has been presented to the contrary.  See Welsh  v. \nNavy Fed. Credit Union , No. 16 -CV-1062, 2018 WL 7283639, at *12 (W.D.  Tex. Aug. \n20, 2018)  (“The Court may . . . presume that no fraud or collusion occurred between \nopposing counsel in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.”) . \niii. Adequacy of Relief ; Expected Complexity, Expense, and Duration \nof the Litigation  \n The proposed settlement agreement provides adequate relief to the class. True, \nthe proposed $3,250,000.00 settlement represents only 7. 61% of the total recovery \nthat class members could have obtained at trial based on Bronstein’s damages model.  \n(Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).  But federal courts have long recognized that, when \nfaced with the expense and unpredictability of ongoing litigation, it often makes good \nsense to settle for ev en small fractions of the total amount in controversy. Ayers v. \nThompson , 358 F.3d 356, 369 (5th Cir. 2004) (observing that settling “avoids the risks \nand burdens of potentially protracted litigation”).  Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 9 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>10 \n  That is especially true when the case involves compl ex issues like those \npresented in this consolidated securities class action. Securities claims are \nparticularly  “difficult to prove ” because of the high bar for  establishing falsity an d \nscienter. Stott v. Capital Fin. Servs., Inc. , 277 F.R.D. 316, 343 (N.D . Tex. 2011); \nFishoff v. Coty Inc. , No. 09 -CV-628, 2010 WL 305358, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.  Jan. 25, 2010) \n(“[T]he element of scienter is often the most difficult and controversial aspect of a \nsecurities fraud claim.”), aff’d , 634 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2011). A trial w ould therefore \nlikely be “lengthy, burdensome, and  would  consume tremendous time and resources.” \nHays, 2019 WL 427331, at * 10. After the trial concluded, the losing party would likely \nappeal the judgement, causing further delay and additional expense.  \n Because any future recovery would be burdensome and unpredictable, \nBronstein opted for a settlement that is immediate and guaranteed. That settlement \nwill adequately and fairly compensate the class. This settlement is  also in line with \nother class settlement  agreements that have been approved by federal courts.4 See, \ne.g., Erica P. John Fund, Inc.  v. Halliburton Co. , No. 3:02 -CV-1152- M, 2018 WL \n1942227, at *5 (N.D.  Tex. Apr. 25, 2018)  (observing that courts frequently approve \nclass action settlements even when the settlement amount is a small fraction of what  \nclass plaintiffs could recover at trial ); City of Omaha Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. LHC \nGrp., No. CIV. 6:12 -1609, 2015 WL 965696, at *7 (W.D. La. Mar. 3, 2015) (“The typical \nrecovery in  most class actions generally is three -to-six cents on the dollar.”).  \n \n 4 As explained below, see infra Part III(D), the proposed settlement is also adequate \nconsidering “the terms of any proposed award of attorney’s fees.” F ED. R. CIV. P. \n23(e)(2)(C)(i ii).   Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 10 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>11 \n  The proposed settlement is adequate not only in its amount  considering the \nrisks of proceeding to trial , but also in two additional ways contemplated in Rule 23’s \nadequacy factor:  \n First , the proposed settlement’s  allocation plan distributes the settlement fund \nthrough a reasonable process. Counsel has retained a third -party administrator to \nprocess the claims, assist claimants in curing deficiencies, and distribute funds on a \npro rata b asis. (Dkt.  #72-1). The Court finds that the proposed distribution process \nwill adequately deliver settlement funds to the class members.  \n Second , the proposed settlement is reasonable considering any agreements \nmade in connection with the proposed settle ment . Although Intrusion may terminate \nthe proposed settlement under a confidential agreement if enough class members \nrequest exclusion from it, (Dkt.  #50 at 14– 15), the Court finds that this agreement is \nfair under the circumstances and does not undermine  the adequacy of the proposed \nsettlement’s relief to the class. See Erica P. John F und, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 1, \n5 (approving a class settlement with a similar confidentiality provision ). The parties \nhave also filed a stipulation that publicly discloses the proposed settlement’s terms. \n(Dkt.  #55).  \niv. Equitable Distribution  \n The proposed settlement’s allocation plan equitably distributes proceeds \nbetween the class members. When an allocat ion plan is “formulated by competent \nand experienced counsel,” it will generally be upheld if it is supported by a “reasonable, rational basis.” In re IMAX Sec. Litig. , 283 F.R.D. 178, 192 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quotations omitted).  Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 11 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>12 \n  Here, the allocation plan is  supported by a reasonable basis. It was developed \nwith the assistance of a damages consultant and provides each class member a pro \nrata share of the settlement fund based on the number of shares purchased during \nthe relevant period. (Dkt.  #55-1 at 7–10); (Dkt.  #65 at  24). In calculating each class \nmember’s pro rata share of the settlement fund, the allocation plan accounts for the timing and price of each purchase, as well as the timing and price of any eventual \nsale, as is common in securities class actio ns. See, e.g. , City of Omaha Police & Fire \nRet. Sys. , 2015 WL 965693, at *15 (approving a class action allocation plan in which \neach class member would receive a pro rata share of a recognized loss); N.Y. State \nTeachers’ Ret. Sys.  v. Gen. Motors Co. , 315 F .R.D. 226, 241 (E.D.  Mich. 2016), aff’d \nsub nom. Marro  v. N.Y. State Teachers’ Ret. Sys. , No. 16 -1821, 2017 WL 6398014 \n(6th Cir. Nov. 27, 2017) (collecting cases approving similar allocation plans).  \nv. Stage of Proceedings and Discovery Efforts  \n The stage  of proceedings and discovery efforts factor also weighs in favor of \napproving the proposed settlement. In evaluating this factor, the key issue is whether the parties and court possess sufficient information to “evaluate the merits of the \ncompeting positi ons.” Ayers, 358 F.3d at 369. Even when the parties “have not \nconducted much formal discovery,” this factor can be satisfied when other information demonstrates that the settlement should be approved. Klein v. O’Neal, Inc. , \n705 F.Supp.2d 632, 65 3 (N.D. Tex. 2010); see also  Union Asset Mgmt. Holding A.G.  v. \nDell, Inc. , 669 F.3d 632, 639 (5th  Cir. 2012) (“ [F]ormal discovery is not a prerequisite \nto approving a [class] settlement as reasonable. ”). That conclusion flows naturally \nfrom the general prin ciple that early settlements should be encouraged, not hindered, Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 12 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>13 \n so long as the parties have obtained the “desired quantum of information necessary \nto achieve a settlement.” Jenkins v. Trustmark Nat’l Bank , 300 F.R.D. 291, 304 \n(S.D. Miss. 2014) (quotations  omitted).  \n Here, the parties have obtained ample information to achieve an informed \nsettlement. To begin, Bronstein’s counsel engaged in an extensive pre- suit \ninvestigation to determine the strength of the claims against Intrusion. (Dkt.  #65-2 \n¶ 32). This pre-suit investigation involved reviewing public documents, including \nSEC filings and analyst reports, and retaining a private investigator. (Dkt.  #65 \nat 15); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32). Following the pre- suit investigation, the parties extensively \nnegotiated the proposed settlement and participated in a full -day mediation with an \nexperienced mediator, which enabled the parties to develop a “full understanding of \nthe legal and factual issues surrounding [the] case” before agreeing to the proposed \nsettlement. Manchaca  v. Chater, 927 F.Supp. 962, 967 (E.D. Tex. 1996).  \nvi. Probability of Success on the Merits  \n The proposed settlement’s fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy is further \ndemonstrated by the uncertainty of success should the case proceed to trial. When there has been no showing of fraud or collusion , the probability of success is the most \nimportant factor in evaluating a proposed settlement. Smith v. Crystian , 91 F.App’x. \n952, 955 n.3 (5th  Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (citing Parker v. Anderson , 667 F.2d 1204, \n1209 (5th  Cir. 1982)). This factor requires the court to “compare the terms of the \nsettlement wi th the rewards the class would have been likely to receive following a \nsuccessful trial.” DeHoyos  v. Allstate Corp. , 240 F.R.D. 269, 287 (W.D. Tex. 2007). But \nin comparing the settlement’s terms with the potential rewards at trial, the c ourt Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 13 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>14 \n must avoid “tr y[ing] the case in the settlement hearings.” Reed , 703 F.2d at 172. That \nwould undermine the settlement’s “very purpose,” which is to “avoid the delay and \nexpense of such a trial.”  Id. (quotations omitted ).  \n Here, the claims against Intrusion are hotly co ntested and difficult to prove. \nAgainst Bronstein’s efforts to develop these claims through extensive investigation \nand expert analysis, Intrusion has retained sophisticated counsel to oppose these \nefforts and would likely continue opposing them through tr ial and appeal. Intrusion \nwould no doubt challenge the sufficiency of Bronstein’s proof on a notoriously difficult \nelement in a securities claim: scienter. See Stott, 277 F.R.D. at 343 (noting that \nsecurities claims are “difficult to prove”).  \n Even if Bronstein established Intrusion’s liability for the alleged securities \nviolations, he would face additional challenges certifying a class and establishing \ndamages on a class -wide basis. For example,  it is likely that  Intrusion  would \nvigorously dispute the connection between  its alleged wrongdoing and the drop in its \nstock price. If Bronstein could prove that connection, Intrusion could still dispute \nwhat portion of the drop was attributable to its  actions as opposed to other causes.  \n The result would be a protracted battle of the experts that is avoided through \nthe proposed settlement. See In re Cendant Corp. Litig. , 264 F.3d 201, 236, 286 \n(3d Cir. 2001) (approving class action settlement in securities litigation in which \ncompeting positions on damages issu es would have devolved into a “battle of the \nexperts”); In re OCA, Inc. Sec. & Derivative Litig. , No. CV- 05-2165, 2009 WL 512081, \nat *14 (E.D. La. Mar. 2, 2009) (“Because the jury would have been faced with Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 14 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>15 \n competing expert opinions, the resulting damage a ward would have been highly \nunpredictable.”).  \nvii. Range and Certainty of Recovery \n The range and certainty of recovery factor also weighs in favor of approving \nthe proposed settlement. In evaluating this factor, the Court must begin by \nestablishing a “ran ge of possible damages that could be recovered at trial.” Maher v. \nZapata Corp. , 714 F.2d 436, 460 (5th Cir. 1983) ( quotations omitted ). After \nestablishing the range of possible damages that could be recovered at trial, the Court then determines whether the settlement is “pegged at a [fair] point in the range” in \nlight of the “likelihood of prevailing at trial and other factors.” Id.  (quota tions \nomitted).    \n As explained in the discussion of the above factors, see supra Part III(A)(i) –(vi), \nBronstein and the class faced considerable risks in proceeding to trial. Considering these risks, it is far from guaranteed that the class would have rec overed even a \nfraction of the total amount in controversy. Thus, while the high end of the class’s \npotential recovery was $42.7 million , (Dkt.  #65 at 19), the low end of the class’s \npotential recovery was $0.00 —with the balance of probabilities weighing in  favor of \nrecovery closer to the low end than to the high end.  \n The $3,250,000.00 settlement is therefore pegged at a fair point in the range \nof total recovery. It represents 7. 61% of the class’s total potential recovery, which is \na respectable percentage  given the uncertainties of proceeding to trial, the \ncomplexities of class action lawsuits, and the difficulties in proving securities \nviolations.  (Dkt.  #65 at  19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21). Indeed, it is common in class action Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 15 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>16 \n lawsuits for plaintiffs to recover only “three -to-six cents on the dollar.” City of Omaha \nPolice & Fire Ret. Sys. , 2015 WL 965696, at *7.  \nviii. Opinions of Participants and Absent Class Members \n The virtually unanimous support for the proposed settlement also \ndemonstrates its fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy. The named parties and \nclass counsel all believe that the proposed settlement is a favorable outcome for both the active participants i n the litigation and the absent class members. That the \nparties and class counsel unanimously support the proposed settlement is an important fact weighing in favor of its approval because, “absent fraud, collusion, or \nthe like,” the Court “should be hesit ant to substitute its own judgment for that of \ncounsel.” Cotton v. Hinton , 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977). And here, the parties \nand counsel, all of whom are sophisticated, have vigorously defended their respective \npositions, lending further support f or the settlement’s fairness.  \n In addition to the named parties and class counsel, the absent class members \nalso appear to support the proposed settlement. Out of nearly 29,000 potential class \nmembers who received notice of the settlement, and more than 1 ,000 potential class \nmembers who responded to the notice, no potential class members objected to the proposed settlement or validly requested to be excluded from it. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶¶ 7 –8). \nThis lack of objection from the class members supports the “adequacy of the \nsettlement.” Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at *5 (quotations omitted).   Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 16 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>17 \n B. The Class Members Received Adequate Notice of the Proposed \nSettlement .  \n The Court also finds that the class members received adequate notice of the \nproposed settl ement. The adequacy of a class settlement notice is not governed by \n“rigid rules.” Wal -Mart Stores, Inc.  v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396  F.3d 96, 114 (2d  Cir. \n2005) ; Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 3 n.1. Instead, the notice must \nsatisfy the “broad reasonableness standard []” imposed by due process and Rule 23(e).  \nIn re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig. , 628 F.3d 185, 197 (5th Cir. 2010) (quotations \nomitted).  To satisfy that standard,  the notice must provide cla ss members with \n“information reasonably necessary” to decide whether t o object to the settlement or \nnot. Id. The standard does not require, however, “actual notice to each party” to be \nbound by the settlement.  Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 3 n.1 (citing \nMullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Tr. Co. , 339 U.S. 306, 313 –14 (1950)) .  \n Here, the class notices were adequate both in  timing and content. In terms of \ntiming, class counsel published and distributed the class settlement notices f orty days \nbefore the deadline to object to the settlement. (Dkt.  #56 at 18– 19); (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). \nThese efforts resulted in delivery of notices  to nearly 29,000 potential class members \nby email or postcard before the objection deadline. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). The Court finds, \ntherefore, that the notice procedures provided class members ample time to object to \nthe settlement if they  wished to do so. See DeJulius v. New England Health Care \nEmps. Pension Fund , 429  F.3d 935, 947 (10th  Cir. 2005) (holding that the class \nmembers received adequate notice of a class settlement when the notices were “sent \nout nearly two weeks prior to the settlement hearing”).  Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 17 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>30 \n  Amount Involved and Results Obtained. The amount in controversy in this \ncase is significant: $42.7 million, according to Bronstein’s damages expert. (Dkt.  #65 \nat 19). Counsel obtained 7.61% of that amount through the pr oposed settlement.  \n(Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).  Given that plaintiffs typically recover only “three -\nto-six cents on the dollar” in class actions, City of Omaha Police & Fire Ret. Sys. , 2015 \nWL 965696, at *7, that is a favorable result.  See also Parker v. Anderson , 667 F.2d \n1204, 1210 (5th  Cir. 1982) (observing that class settlements can be fair and adequate \neven when they “amount to a fraction of the potential recovery [at trial]” (quotations \nomitted)). This factor supports the requested fee award w ithout need for any \nadjustment.   \nTime Limitations; Nature and Length of Relationship with Client.  The \ntime limitations and client relationship factors also  do not require any adjustment to \nthe requested fee award. As for time limitations, the parties have not identified any \ntiming constraints  imposed by the clients or circumstances. Erica P. John Fund, 2018 \nWL 1942227, at *11 (“This factor does not apply in this case because there is no indication that Lead Plaintiff imposed any time limits in the prosecution of this \ncase.”); see also  In re Combustion, Inc. , 968 F.Supp. at 1135) (“Even though it is \napparent that the Johnson factors must be addressed to ensure  that the resulting fee \nis reasonable, not every factor need be necessarily considered.”).  \n And as for the nature and length of the client relationship, the Court finds that \nclass counsel ably represent ed the class beginning in 2021. Both class counsel and  \nBronstein actively participated in the litigation for its full duration. Considering Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 30 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>31 \n counsel’s dedication to Bronstein and to the class stretching more than a year, the \nrequested fee award adequately compensates counsel. That conclusion is supported \nby Br onstein’s declaration, in which he states that  class counsel regularly discussed \nthe case with him, provided “periodic status reports,” and deserves the requested fees—all facts suggesting that the attorney -client relationship was strong. (Dkt.  #66-\n4 ¶¶ 5–6, 8–9); Erica P. John Fund, 2018 WL 1942227, at *12 (finding that this factor \nweighed in favor of a requested fee award when “the professional relationship with \nLead Plaintiff w as positive”).   \niii. Lodestar Cross- Check  \n A lodestar cross -check  confirms the reasonableness of the fees requested. The \nlodestar method focuses on the work performed as opposed to the recovery obtained. \nTo calculate the lodestar, the court multiplies the attorney’s hourly rate by the hours \nworked.  See Hobbs v. EVO Inc. , 7 F.4th 241, 259 (5th  Cir. 2021).  The burden is on the \nmoving party to establish the reasonableness of both the rate charged and the hours billed. McClain v. Lufkin Indus., Inc. , 649 F.3d 374, 381 (5th Cir. 2011); Swanston v. \nCity of Plano , No. 4:19 -CV-412, 2022 WL 3567059, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 18, 2022).   \n Here, counsel submitted affidavits and declarations supporting a lodestar \namount of $467,783.00. (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 33–34). The affidavits and declaration s do not \ninclude contemporaneous billing records , detailed time entries , or proof of the rate \ntypically charged in the community, as would typically be required to support a claim \nfor attorney’s fees. See Vaughan v. Lewisville In dep. Sch. Dist. , No. 4:19 -CV-109-SDJ, \n2021 WL 6125786, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 28, 2021); McClain , 649 F.3d at 381– 82. \nHowever, the submitted affidavits and declarations are sufficient under the Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 31 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>32 \n circumstances . No party objected to the fee request. And the Court is employing the \nlodestar method only as a rough cross -check to confirm the reasonableness of the \npercentage award. Turner v. Murphy Oil  USA, Inc. , 472  F.Supp.2d 830, 867 (E.D.  La. \n2007)  (observing that , in performing a lodestar cross -check , the court need not \nscrutinize each time entry and  “representations by class counsel as to total hours \n[worked] may be sufficient” (quotations omitted)).  \n When a lodestar cross -check is applied to  a class -action fee aw ard in a common \nfund case , courts frequently use a multiplier ranging from one to four based on the \nJohnson factors. See, e.g. , Burford , 2012 WL 5471985, at *6 n.1 (approving a 1.78 \nmultiplier and remarking that court s frequently approve multipliers rangin g from \none to four); Di Giacomo v. Plains All Am. Pipeline , No. CV -99-4137, 2001 WL \n34633373, at *10– 11 (S.D.  Tex. Dec. 19, 2001)  (approving a 5.3 multiplier in a \nsecurities class action) .   \n Here, the Johnson factors, for the reasons explained above,  see supra Part \nIII(D)(ii),  support a $1,083,332.00 attorney’s fee  award —which is the lodestar amount \nmultiplied 2.32 times. That multiplier falls in the commonly accepted range. The \nCourt finds that the lodestar c ross-check confirms the reasonableness of the \nrequested fee award.  E. Bronstein and Class Counsel May Recover Reasonable Expenses .  \n \n Bronstein and class counsel may recover reasonable expenses  incurred during \nthe litigation . Bronstein requests $5,000.00 for the considerable time (approximately \nforty hours) he invested in the case communicating with counsel, reviewing Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 32 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>33 \n documents, and participating in settlement negotiations. (Dkt.  #66-4 ¶¶ 3 –7, 11). \nBronstein’s request is author ized under the P SLRA,  which allows a lead plaintiff to \nrecover “reasonable costs and expenses (including lost wages)  directly relating to \nrepresentation of the class.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u -4(a)(4).  \n The Court agrees  that Bronstein invested considerable time and  effort to this \ncase and awards Bronstein  the requested recovery of $5,000 . The award is below what \ncourts have awarded in other class action  cases. See, e.g. , Burford , 2012 WL 5471985, \nat *6 (awarding named plaintiffs up to $15,000.00 in compensation for efforts \nexpend ed representing the class) ; In re Catfish Antitrust Litig. , 939 F.Supp. 493, 504 \n(N.D. Miss. 1996) (awarding $10,000.00).  \n Class Counsel request  reimbursement in the amount of $35,216.89 for \nexpenses incurred representing the  class. (Dkt. #66 at 27, 30 ). Counsel further \nrequests that these expenses be awarded out of the settlement fund in addition to the \n$1,083,332.00 in  attorney’s fees. Because no class member objected to the request , \ncounsel diligently represented the class, and  counsel incurred considerable expense \nwith no guarantee of recovery, the Court finds that the requested amount is \nreasonable under the circumstances and will be awarded.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n The parties and counsel have diligently litigated these consolidated  cases and \nachieved a favorable settlement not only for the named parties, but also for the absent class members. The reasonableness of the settlement is reflected by the lack of any \nobjection to it. The Court finds that the proposed settlement  should be approved, the \nclass certified, and the requested fees and expenses awarded.  Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 33 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>34 \n  It is therefore ORDERED as follows:  \n1. The Court finally approves the proposed settlement agreement, (Dkt.  #55), as \nfair, reasonable, and adequate under the Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure. Its \nterms shall bind all class members.  \n \n2. The Court finally certifies a class of persons or entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Intrusion, Inc. common stock between October 1 4, 2020,  \nand August 26, 2021, both dates inclusive,  and were damaged thereby. The \ncertified class excludes: (a) Defendants; (b) Intrusion, Inc.’s officers, directors, \nand affiliates, at all relevant times; (c) Intrusion. Inc.’s employee retirement or \nbenefit plan(s) and their participants or beneficiaries to the extent they purchased or acquired Intrusion, Inc. stock through any such plan(s); (d) any entity in which Defendants have or had controlling interest; (e) immediate \nfamily members of any excluded person; (f) the legal representatives, heirs, \nsuccess ors, or assigns of any excluded person or entity; and (g) all those who \nsubmit timely and valid requests  for exclusion.  \n \n3. The Court dismisses with prejudice all claims in this action between the class \nand Defendants.  \n \n4. The Court approves the parties’ propo sed allocation plan as a fair and \nreasonable method of allocating the settlement fund among class members. The Court directs the parties to distribute  through the claims administer  the \nsettlement fund in accordance with the settlement agreement and stipula tion. \n(Dkt.  #55).  \n \n5.  The Court awards class counsel $1,083,332.00 in attorney’s fees and \n$35,216.89 in expenses. The Court awards lead Plaintiff Andrew Bronstein \n$5,000.00 for expenses.   \n \n  \n \n \n Case 4:21-cv-00307-SDJ     Document 74     Filed 12/16/22     Page 34 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a class action lawsuit concerning data privacy against Google LLC, where plaintiffs have alleged that Google collected data from users with Web & App Activity (WAA) switched off without consent. Both parties filed several motions in limine in preparation for trial, and the court's order partially granted and denied these motions. The case particularly involves complex issues around data collection agreements and whether consumer expectations were accurately set by Google’s disclosures.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Google unlawfully collected and utilized users’ data when the users had WAA switched off, and whether its conduct was knowingly highly offensive and violated California laws on privacy and data usage.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted Google's motion to bifurcate the trial phases for compensatory and punitive damages and largely excluded unrelated evidence, such as non-U.S. consumer studies, unrelated lawsuits, and evidence about Alphabet's total revenues. However, it permitted certain pieces of evidence concerning Google's privacy practices, relevant consumer understanding, and certain financials directly related to Google services at issue.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you told a friend not to read your diary, and later you found out they not only read it but used what they learned to make money. Here, people are accusing Google of snooping on private data despite having settings that should have stopped it. Before going to trial, both sides asked the judge to decide which evidence could be shown to the jury. The judge said only arguments and evidence directly related to Google's actions towards these data collection settings could be used, not unrelated business information or lawsuits.",

INTRODUCTION  \nTrial soon begins in this massive data privacy class action .  Damages could range  from \nhundreds of millions to  billions of dollars.  As to be expected in such a high -stakes case, both \nparties have filed numerous  motions in limine , seeking  guidance on various evidentiary issues .  \nThe motions are granted  in part and denied in part, as explained further infra . \nII. MOTION TO BIFURCATE  \nDefendant moves to bifurcate trial such that discussion of Google’s liability for , and the \namount of , any punitive damages is heard only if the jury first finds  liability and awards \ncompensatory damages.  In its view, “exposing the jury to Google’s revenue figures when they are \ndeliberating over liability issues might bias the jury against Google.”  Mot. at 4.  Plaintiffs oppose \nbifurcation, highlighting that it would depart from the norm and contending that evidence related \nto punitive damages is intertwin ed with evidence related to liability issues such as the \noffensiveness of the alleged intrusions and whether Google acted with the requisite intent.  \n“The normal procedure is to try compensatory and punitive damage claims together with Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 1 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  appropriate instructions to make clear to the jury the difference in the clear and convincing \nevidence required for the award of punitive damages.”  Hangarter v. Provident Life & Accident \nIns. Co. , 373 F.3d 998, 1021 (9th Cir. 2004).   Whether to take a different tack  is a discretionary \ndecision informed by considerations of “ convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite and \neconomize[.]”   Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) . \nThis case is complex, and the jury already will be weighing several damages questions if it \nfinds liability.  The compensatory damages amount is hotly disputed , given Plaintiffs’ expert’s \n“conservative” estimate of roughly $500 million, the many critiques Defendant has with the \nvariables that result in  that total, and Plaintiffs’ apparent plans  to seek some figure higher than  \ntheir expert’s floor.  The jury will also be invited to provide an advisory verdict on the question of \ndisgorgement as a remedy for  the allegedly unlawful use of Plaintiffs’ da ta; as explained further \ninfra , evidence relevant to that question is more limited in scope than the evidence relevant to the \npunitive damages question, given that the former concerns the money Defendant earned from the \nalleged conduct, whereas the latter concerns Defendant’s ability to pay  punitive damages if the \njury deigns to award them.  On top of all that, the jury may also be weighing  nominal damages for \nvarious hard-to-measure  harms, such as lost peace of mind, depleted battery p ower , and the \nviolation of  privacy .   \nConsidering the extent of damages inquir ies already presented to the jury, the \ninconvenience raised by burdening them with yet more calculations, and the prejudice risked by \nintroducing evidence of Google’s total worth, Defendant’s request to bifurcate  is granted with \nrespect to the amount of punitive damages, if any, to be awarded.  Other courts have followed a \nsimilar route.  Lopez v. San Saba Vineyards, Inc. , No. 22 -cv-02652 -VKD, 2023 WL 4410507, at \n*3 (N.D. Cal. July 7, 2023)  (“If, in the first phase of trial, the jury finds in favor of [Plaintiffs]  on \nliability issues and finds that [they are]  entitled to punitive damages, trial will immediately \nproceed to a second phase in which the same jury will consider the amount of punitive damages to \naward. ”).  As a result, e vidence of Google’s total worth will be excluded from the initial phase of \ntrial.  That said, the initial phase will feature evidence as to whether punitive damages may be Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 2 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  warranted , as well as the more limited scope evidence  (needed for the disgorgement inquiry)  of \nGoogle’s profits from the conduct at issu e.  Plaintiffs ’ opposition focuses largely on their interest \nin introducing certain evidence; they do not present compelling reasons why the jury needs to \ndecide the amount of punitive damages at the same time it decides everything else.  Their specific \nevidentiary concerns are better addressed in particular motions in limine  discussed infra . \nIII. PLAINTIFFS’ MOTIONS IN LIMINE  \n1. Exclude Evidence and Argument About Counsel Compensation  \nPlaintiffs ’ first motion in limine  seeks to exclude evidence or argument pertaining to \ncounsel compensation, including the possibility that counsel receives  a cut of the damages .  \nGoogle presents  no oppositio n.  Such evidence and argument s are therefore excluded.  \n2. Exclude Argument that Litigation Is Lawyer -Driven  \nPerhaps related to their first, Plaintiffs’ second motion in limine requests that Google be \nbarred from characterizing the litigation as lawyer -driven.  Google agrees not to use that phrase \nbut otherwise opposes the motion as overbroad; its concerns are better addressed  with respect to \nPlaintiffs’ third motion in limine . \n3. Exclude Evidence and Argument about Size, Profitability, or Type of Work by \nCounsel  \nPlaintiffs next move to preclude Google from presenting arguments about the size, \nprofitability, and work of  their counsel’s firms.  Google does not oppose the motion, but objects \ninasmuch as  Plaintiffs seek to block it from discussing the circumstances that led to the initiation \nof this litigation, including how Plaintiffs learned about the alleged harms and launched  the case . \nThe intricacies of how this litigation evolved are not important to the jury; what matters is \nthe evidence relevant to disputed , material issues of  fact.  Such evidence , however,  may include \nPlaintiffs’ experiences , including about their discovery of the harm they necessarily allege .  See, \ne.g., Montera v. Premier Nutrition Corp. , No. 16 -cv-6980 -RS, 2022 WL 1465044, at *1 (N.D. \nCal. May 9, 2022) (where defendant agreed  “to not put in evidence or argument . . . that this case \nis ‘’lawyer -driven ’ litigation,”  defendant was not barred  from asking  plaintiff “how she became Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 3 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  involved in this case and whether she had been dissatisfied with the [at-issue]  product before \nlearning of the case in an attorney advertisement” ).  Given the limited relevance of firm finances , \nGoogle would do well to steer clear of examining  Plaintiffs’  counsel’s role in the case  or its \ngeneral business model, size, or profitability .  Any further objections may be raised in due course.  \n4. Exclude Evidence and Argument About Former Plaintiffs Who Voluntarily \nDismissed Their Claims  \nPlaintiffs move in limine  to preclude Google from offering evidence or argument \n“pertaining to former plaintiffs who voluntarily dismissed their claims.”  Five plaintiffs withdrew \ntheir claims over three years ago , but the sixth , Sal Cataldo,  moved for dismissal only one month \nbefore trial —after having already been deposed.1  Plaintiffs say individual decisions by former or \nwithdrawing members are irrelevant  to class -wide claims .  Even if their testimony  is relevant,  \nPlaintiffs argue,  it is inadmissible  hearsay  and far more prejudicial than probative .  Defendant \nfocuses its opposition on Cataldo , stating that it does not seek to offer evidence pertaining to any \nformer Plaintiffs who withdrew their claims before being deposed.   \nWhether evidence and argument about Cataldo is admissible in this case will be \ndetermined in the order addressing his pending motion to dismiss.  As for the other plaintiffs who \nvoluntarily dismissed claims, in light of  Google’s non-opposition to their exclusion , the motion is \ngranted.  \n5. Exclude Evidence and Argument About Plaintiffs’ Complaint and Case’s \nProcedural History  \nPlaintiffs’ fifth motion in limine seeks to preclude Google from introducing the prior \ncomplaints, motions, other docket entries, and “ all testimony and argument about what Plaintiffs \nalleged before trial.”  Mot. at 15.  Plaintiffs contend that  their earlier claims , defenses , and any \nassociated failures  are irrelevant to the instant dispute and, at any rate, too prejudicial.   \nDefendant rebut s this argument  by explaining  the extent to which numerous courts have \n \n1 Cataldo’s motion to dismiss his claims is presently pending.  To expedite its resolution, \nDefendant shall file a responsive brief by August 8, and the matter will be taken under \nconsideration at that time.  Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 4 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  held that prior averments  in a complaint are admissible as statements once seriously made by an \nauthorized agent .  Huey v. Honeywell, Inc. , 82 F.3d 327, 333 (9th Cir. 1996) (internal citation \nomitted) .  Defendants may use prior pleadings “as both non -binding evidentiary admissions and as \nimpeachment” because counterarguments  or explanations go to weight , not admissibility.   \nHassebrock v. Air & Liquid Sys. Corp. , No. 14 -cv-1835 -RSM, 2016 WL 4496917, at *6 (W.D. \nWash. 2016) ; see also Schuh v. Oil Well Supply Co., 50 Cal. App. 588, 590 (1920) (“[W]here a \nparty is a witness, pleadings that have been superseded .  . . are available as admissions, and for use \non cross -examination for purposes of impeachment.”).  \nTo be sure,  focusing on  the evolution of Plaintiffs ’ case is hardly a good use of public \ncourt resource s, and Google is expected not to raise  prior asserted legal claims —only factual \nallegations relevant  to and probative of the disputes at issue . \n6. Exclude Argument Characterizing the CDAFA’s Purpose as Anti -Hacking  \nPlaintiffs’ sixth motion in limine  urges the court to rule that Google must not  characterize \nthe CDAFA as an “anti -hacking” statute, either through argument or evidence about the legislative \nhistory, its supposed purpose, or any other characterizations.  Google has framed the statute as \nanti-hacking throughout th is litigation , and Plaintiffs contend such framing is irrelevant and \nmisleading.  The statute does not use the term anti -hacking  and prohibits more than just hacking \nby its plain language and as sho wn by precedent.  Google replies  that plenty of courts have \nrecognized the statute’s anti -hacking aspects .  See, e.g. , In re Zoom Video Commc’ns. Privacy \nLitig. , 525 F. Supp. 3d 1017, 1043 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (“CDAFA is an anti -hacking statute [.]”). \nDefendant  must  focus on the elements of the claims and affirmative defenses, not the \ngenesis  of the statute .  Characterizing the law as “anti -hacking” is precluded.  \n7. Exclude Evidence that App Developers Consented to Sharing Data with \nGoogle or the Argument that Developer -Google Agreements Could Establish \nConsent or Permission for Plaintiffs’ Claims  \nPlaintiffs next move in limine to exclude any argument or evidence that Google secured the \nrequisite permission or consent based on agreements that it made with third -party apps.  Google \npreviously argued, unsuccessfully, that “the most correct lens to view this claim through is one Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 5 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that focuses on Google’s permission vis -à-vis the app developers, not the end users .”  Dkt. No. \n381 at 25 ; see also id. (“Google never exceeded the scope of its permission to use the data \ngathered by app developers and sent to Google via GA for Firebase.”).   According to Plaintiffs, \nsuch argument lacks support  and is in tension with related precedents about third -party \nauthorization to use someone else’s data.  As the summary judgment order observed, “whether a \nthird party granted permission is irrelevant.  Instead, what matters is whether Google knew or \nshould have known that Plaintiffs  revoked permission to use their data.”  Rodriguez v. Google \nLLC, 772 F. Supp. 3d 1093, 1 108 (N.D. Cal. 2025)  (“Summary Judgment Order”).  \nGoogle opposes the motion , even as it recognizes that it may not argue the permission it \ngot from  app developers is sufficient under  CDAFA; the court rejected that argument, as noted \nabove.  Google maintains, however, that it should be able to argue the following chain of consent: \nOne of its policies notified users that (1) Google Analytics exists , (2) Google’s business partners \nuse it, and (3) through that program , Google can collect information about a third -party app user’s \napp activity.  Other Google policies —regarding their agreements with business partners like app \ndevelopers —required developers using GA4F to disclose as much to u sers.  As a result, in \nDefendant’s logic, it would be objectively unreasonable to think that toggling (s)WAA to the off \nposition in a Google Account would override the third -party app disclosure about the app’s \nbusiness with Google Analytics.2   \nDefendant may introduce evidence that it  required app developers to reveal their use of \nGoogle Analytics in attempting to rebut the argument that it acted in a highly offensive manner \nbut not as part of the chain of consent.  It has conceded that no third -party  app disclosure to users \ndiscussed WAA or (s)WAA, so such disclosures necessarily do not speak to whether Plaintiffs  \n \n2 This motion overlaps with Google tenth motion in limine , which seeks to exclude \nevidence and arguments about third -party app compliance with Google’s GA4F terms of service; \nit also touches on Google’s proposed jury instruction that would have the jury assume all third -\nparty apps complied with the GA4F terms of  service by disclosing their use of the product to \nPlaintiffs.  \n Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 6 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  consented to WAA -off or (s)WAA -off collection by agreeing to them.  Relatedly, Plaintiffs may \nnot argue that Google failed to obtain the necessary consent by pointing to the dearth of evidence \nabout third -party app compliance with Google’s policies.  The consent question in this case \nrevolves around the relationship between Google and Plaintiffs, not the apps and Plaintiffs  nor \nGoogle and the apps .  Were Google’s disclosures to Plaintiffs  unclear such that it was objectively \nreasonable for Plaintiffs to expect that turning WAA or  (s)WAA off would stop Google from \ncollecting their data through third -party apps that used Google Analytics and/or GA4F?  The jury \nwill decide .   \n8. Exclude Evidence that Plaintiffs’ Continued Using Google Products and \nServices After Filing the Suit, or Alternatively, The Argument that Such Use is \nRelevant to Elements of Harm, Consent, and Permission  \nPlaintiffs’ final motion in limine  seeks to preclude evidence and argument regarding the \nextent (if any) to which Plaintiffs continue to use apps that contain the at -issue SDKs.  Google \nargues such evidence goes to the degree of harm and the seriousness of the alleged intrusions; \nPlaintiff s stated in depositions that they made no meaningful changes in their behavior after \nlearning of the alleged privacy violations.  Continued use may also go to their credibility.  \nEvidence of Plaintiffs’ continued use does not mean they consent, but it is relevant to other \nissues, such as the degree of offensiveness, and therefore  amounts to  admissible deposition \ntestimony.   Standard cross -examination will inform whatever weight this testimony warrants.  \nIV. DEFENDANT’S MOTIONS IN LIMINE  \n1. Exclude  Testimony of Blake Lemoine  \nIn its first motion in limine , Google argues that Plaintiff s must not be permitted to call \nformer Google employee Blake Lemoine as a witness.  Lemoine is a former senior Google \nemployee who worked on artificial intelligence products and was later placed on leave when  he \ntried to hire a lawyer for a chatbot that he believed to be sentient.  After  he blogged about the \nprospect of being fired for his AI “ethics” work and leaked information to major news outlets, \nGoogle terminated him in July 2022.   \nPlaintiffs apparently intend to present to the jury portions of Lemoine’s deposition Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 7 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  testimony from a different case.  In the instant matter, discovery closed in October 2022, but \nLemoine contacted Plaintiffs’ counsel in August 2023 about a separate  lawsuit they are litigating \nagainst Google  concerning its Chrome web browser ’s “Incognito” mode .  Counsel subsequently \ntook him on as a client and deposed him in that matter, Brown v. Google, LLC , Case No.: 4:20 -cv-\n3664 -YGR  (N.D. Cal 2021), which concerns allegations against Defendant distinct from those at \nissue in the instant case.  During deposition  redirect , Plaintiffs’ counsel elicited testimony from \nLemoine about WAA -off data, then said, “back to the topic at hand” and returned the line of \nquestioning to topics more relevant to that dispute.  One month later, counsel sought to reopen \ndiscovery  in this case  for Lemoine’s documents, a request which Google refused.  In February \n2024, Plaintiffs served a joint letter brief about compelling Lemoine’s deposition but then \nabandoned the effort and never brought it up again.  It was only in the past several weeks that \nPlaintiffs revealed an intent to present Lemoine’s deposition testimony fr om the Brown  case \nduring the upcoming trial.  \nAccording to Google, this is  an ambush.  It urges the testimony’s exclusion on several \ngrounds.  First, Defendant  contend s that his testimony came so belatedly that it is excluded under \nRule 37(c)(1).  “ A party cannot ignore discovery deadlines  for a year, make a single improper and \nabandoned attempt to cure and then, due to its own lack of  diligence, seek to read testimony they \nmanufactured in another lawsuit into trial here. ”  Mot. at 4.  Second, Google argues his testimony \nis irrelevant as it concerns different products and users than those presently at issue.  Third, \nDefendant contends the testimony is inadmissible hearsay and that the relevant rule of evidence \npermitting its introduction is not satisfie d here, where Google lacked the requisite “similar \nmotive” to develop the testimony.  Finally, Defendant says that, on balance, the risk of unfair \nprejudice dwarfs any conceivable probative value of Lemoine’s testimony.  \nPlaintiffs respond that their late disclosure was substantially justified or harmless such that \nthe witness’s evidence is admissible under  Rule 37(c)(1).  They had no choice but to disclose him \nlate, they say, since he reached out after discovery closed.  His testimony is relevant  because it \nconcerns a profitable use of the data and the revelation that he disclosed his concerns to Google’s \ntop brass.  Moreover, Rule 804(b)(1) is satisfied because Plaintiffs believe that Google had a Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 8 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  similar motive to cross -examine Lemoine in Brown as they would have had here.  Finally, \nPlaintiffs reject the idea that the testimony could prejudice Google, or at any rate, that the \nprejudice would outweigh the probative value of his insights.  \nThis motion is granted: Lemoine’s deposition transcript from another case, about \ncompletely distinct technologies, is inadmissible hearsay that fails to qualify for the former \ntestimony exception under Rule  804(b)(1).  Counsel in Brown , a distinct group  from the one  \nlitigating the case here, plainly did not have a similar motive to develop his testimony.  That case \nwas about browsing in Incognito mode, not (s)WAA -off data tracking through third -party apps.  \nMoreover, the fact that Plaintiffs did not more de liberately seek his deposition in this case —i.e., \nbelatedly starting but then dropping a bid to compel it —hardly suggests that his testimony is \nparticularly  probative .   \n2. Exclude Plaintiffs’ Introduction of Evidence and Arguments re: Disgorgement  \nGoogle’s second motion in limine aims  to preclude Plaintiffs from arguing to the jury  that \nGoogle should be disgorged of the profits that resulted from the allegedly unjust enrichment it \nachieved via use of (s)WAA -off data.  Disgorgement is an equitable remedy in the context of this \ncase, Google contends, because the claims concern  particular property (personal data) and the \nproceeds flowing therefrom.  Where such remedy determinations are equitable, they remain \n“within the sound discretion of the trial  court and, therefore, outside the province of the jury. ”  GSI \nTech., Inc. v. United Memories, Inc. , 721 F. App ’x 591, 594 (9th Cir. 2017); see also SEC v. Rind , \n991 F.2d  1486, 1493 (9th Cir. 1993) ( finding that disgorgement of profits is an equitable issue to \nwhich no right to jury  attaches) . \nPlaintiffs  respond  that evidence and argument about disgorgement reduce to ones about \nGoogle’s unjust enrichment, which is relevant to whether its underlying conduct was  highly \noffensive, an element of the privacy tort claims, and also whether Google caused damage or loss in \nviolation of CDAFA.  They highlight cases and prior orders in the instant litigation recognizing  \nhow proof that a defendant profited from a plaintiff’s data can satisfy the damage or l oss element \nof CDAFA and privacy tort claims.  See Summary Judgment Order at 1110 (“Plaintiffs have a Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 9 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  stake in the value of their data” and “a reasonable juror could find that Plaintiffs suffered damage \nor loss because Google profited from the misappropriation of their data .”).  Moreover, Plaintiffs \nargue, the jury in this case can decide the disgorgement question because it is a legal remedy.  \nWhether a remedy like disgorgement “is legal or equitable depends on the basis for [the \nplaintiff's] claim and the nature of the underlying remedies sought.”  Great -W. Life & Annuity Ins. \nCo. v. Knudson , 534 U.S. 204, 213 (2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In that \ncase, the Supreme Court confronted a federal statute that authorizes civil actions “to enjoin” any \nact violating the terms of an ERISA plan or “to obtain other appropriate  equitable relief.”  Id. at \n209 (citing 29 U.S.C. §  1132(a)(3)).  Because the petitioners there sought “to impose personal \nliability on respondents for a contractual obligation to pay money,” the Court concluded that the \nrequested restitution was legal in nature and thus not available as an equitable remedy \ncontemplated by the statute.  \nHere, by contrast, Plaintiffs contend that “money or property identified as belonging in \ngood conscience to [themselves] could clearly be traced to particular funds or property in the \ndefendant’s possession.”  Id. at 213.  The Great -West  Court suggested such cases are the \nprototypical example of  equitable, not legal relief —“for restitution to lie in equity, the action \ngenerally must seek not to impose personal liability on the defendant, but to restore to the plaintiff \nparticular funds or property in the defendant’s possession.”  Id. at 214. \nGiven the Supreme Court’s guidance on restitution, the disgorgement Plaintiffs seek \nappears to be an equitable, not a legal, remedy.  They intend to argue that particular funds Google \nhas—i.e., those it generates through use of their data in programs like App Promo, Admob, and \nAd Manager —are traceable to the particular data that Defendant allegedly collected and used \nwithout Plaintiffs’  permission or consent.  This relief is quite different from that which the Great -\nWest  court  deemed lega l, where the funds petitioners sought were not in respondents’ possession, \nand the nature of the claim was that “petitioners are contractually entitled to some funds for \nbenefits that they conferred.”  Id. at 715.  Moreover, the only statutory claim in this case permits \n“compensatory damages and injunctive relief or other equitable relief,” see Cal. Penal Code \n§502(e)(1), suggesting that the only way disgorgement could be granted  on that claim  would be as Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 10 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  equitable relief.   California law generally allows “disgorgement of profits resulting from unjust \nenrichment,” and courts have characterized such claims as necessarily equitable in nature.  See In \nre Ford Tailgate Litig. , No. 11 -cv-2953 -RS, 2014 WL  3899545, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 8, 2014) ; \nCity of Oakland v. Oakland Raiders , 83 Cal. App. 5th 458, 478 (2022) ( describing  unjust \nenrichment as an equitable doctrine).  At bottom, “Plaintiffs here are not seeking ‘some  funds,’ but \nrather the funds” Google allegedl y acquired on the basis of the ir personal data .  See Sivolella v. \nAXA Equitable Funds Mgmt. , LLC, No. 11 -cv-4194 -PGS, 2013 WL 4096239, at *5 (D.N.J. July 3, \n2013) (finding disgorgement  equitable in nature)  (internal citation to Great -West  omitted).  \nBecause it appears that disgorgement is, in this case, an equitable remedy, the ultimate \ndetermination as to any amount awarded rests with the court.  That said, Plaintiffs present \ncompelling arguments to suggest California law contemplates disgorgement from privacy \nviolations as a jury issue.  See CACI No. 1821 (damages for unauthorized use of name or \nlikeness), Cal. Civ. Code §  3344(a).  Rule 39(c)(1) provides courts the discretionary authority to \nseek an advisory jury, and here, there appears some prospect  that the disgorgement requested \ncould  ultimately  be deemed legal in nature.  Were that the case, and no advisory jury verdict were \nobtained as a backstop, the decision to treat disgorgement as an equitable cons ideration raises the \npossibility of a necessary re -trial given the Seventh Amendment ’s provision for the right to a jury .  \n“The right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution —or as \nprovided by a federal statute —is preserved to the parties inviolate.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(a).   \nMoreover, Plaintiffs highlight that unjustly profiting from Plaintiffs’ data can amount to damage \nor loss under the CDAFA, see In re Facebook, Inc. Internet Tracking Lit. , 956 F.3d 589, 599 –601 \n(9th Cir. 2020), which suggests that evidence pertinent to the disgorgement inquiry overlaps with \nelements that Plaintiffs must prove.  \nThus, although the decision whether to award any disgorgement remedies is equitable in \nthis particular matter , the jury will be invited to consider the remedy in an advisory capacit y, as \nother courts have done in similar contexts.  See, e.g. , Cisco Sys. Inc. v. Arista Networks, Inc. , No. \n14-cv-05344 -BLF, 2016 WL 11752975, at *7 , n.2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 16, 2016) .  Google argues that \nto do so risks undue prejudice  based on the concern that Plaintiff will anchor the jury by Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 11 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  presenting the disgorgement award theory ($1.5 billion to $2.5 billion) and then offering a “more \nreasonable” lower actual damages figure (in the realm of $500 million).  This argument is \nunpersuasive  considering that Plaintiffs apparently seek far more than the actual damages figure \ntheir expert provided as a conservative floor.   Moreover, and as discussed further  with respect to \nGoogle’s twelfth  motion in limine , the evidence admissible to prove disgorgement will not include \nAlphabet ’s financials and is i nstead limited  to those for which Googles raises no objection.  \n3. Exclude Introduction of or Reference to Evidence about Leaks or Misuse of \nUnrelated Data or Other Litigation and Investigations into Google Privacy \nPractices  \nIn their third motion in limine , Google combines  two discrete requests.  The first is denied, \nas explained in the prior order addressing its Daubert motion as to Plaintiffs’ expert Bruce \nSchneier.  At the time, Google claimed prejudice would  result if Schneier testified about data leaks \nor misuse of data.  Because this evidence will come as contextual and background information, \nhowever, the prior order  followed in the footsteps of the Brown  court and  denied Google’s bid to \npreclude such testimony at trial .  In this motion, as Plaintiffs appropriately highlight, Google \nessentially reprises its concerns about Schneier’s testimony , which fare no better at this juncture.  \nGoogle’s other  contention is that evidence of and from other matters against Google, \nspread across 12 exhibits from Plaintiffs’ list, ought to be excluded .  Plaintiffs respond that 10 of \nthem do not actually reference other litigation or investigations; they are internal documents, just \nlike many of the others Plaintiffs aim to admit at trial.  Those documents are addressed in the order \non Defendant’s seventh motion in limine , infra . \nThe other two documents  identified in this motion  are barred.  Press releases by the states \nof Arizona and Texas  refer to lawsuits filed against Google over its alleged tracking of location \ndata even when users turned off location history.  Because those suits necessarily concerned a \ndifferent privacy control , they are not particularly probative and only scarcely relevant.  Moreover, \nthey contain precise dollar amounts for settlements, which could unduly prejudice the jury . \n4. Preclude Introduction and Discussion of Any Studies or Surveys on Non -U.S. \nConsumers  About Their Understanding of Certain Google Privacy Controls  Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 12 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Google next moves in limine to preclude Plaintiffs from revealing to the jury some of its \nown research into non -U.S. consumers and their understanding of Google privacy controls and the \nrelated disclosures.  It appears that Schneier planned to reference these studies when testifying \nabout consumer expectation , prior to being precluded from testifying about the topic beyond his \nexpertise.   Google says the studies  are not relevant to this case because they concern non -U.S. \nconsumers who were specifically sele cted for high privacy consciousness .  Moreover, even if the \nstudies are relevant, Google maintains that the risk of unfair prejudice and confusing the issues \nsubstantially outweighs their probative value.  \nThe motion is denied.  Google’s internal findings about what European consumers \nunderstand about WAA and (s)WAA toggles, and the fact that it sent those findings to the person \nin charge of the (s)WAA product in the United States , amount to evidence that is obviously \nrelevant and highly probative in this case —which concerns Google’s use of (s)WAA -off U.S. user \ndata.  The evidence could inform the jury’s determination as to whether Plaintiffs’ expectation of \nprivacy was reasonable or whether Google obtained t he necessary consent or permission, not to \nmention whether Google’s conduct was knowing or could be considered highly  offensive.  \nMoreover, any doubts raised by their non -U.S. based nature may be explored via cross -\nexamination; the jury may yet assign these studies little to no value as it sees fit.  At any rate, the \nrisk of prejudice here is not particularly high —Google identifies no special difference between \nEuropeans and Americans that would skew the results —and the probative value of this evidence is \nnot substantially outweighed  by whatever dangers do exist .   That Schneier may not opine on \nconsumer expectations because he is not an expert in that field does not mean that Google’s own \ninternal studies about consumer understandings are out of bounds , so long as they are introduced \nin accord with the Federal Rules.  \n5. Exclude Documents and Arguments About Google CEO’s Statements About \nGeneral Privacy Practices, The Collection of Data on the Web, Google’s \n“Location History” Setting, Settings that Control Data Storage While WAA Is \nOn, and Other Products Unrelated to Google Analytics for Firebase  \nGoogle’s fifth motion in limine  is a grab -bag seeking to block over 30 exhibits that it Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 13 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  claims fall into five categories.   Plaintiffs respond by lumping them into four groups that better \nsuit their own framing of the case.  Because neither categorization system quite fits the evidence, \nthe motion is granted in part and denied without prejudice in part as follows.  \nThe motion is granted as to a swath of exhibits that concern  Google’s collection of users \nlocation history  data, which is not relevant to the (s)WAA -off conduct here in a material way.  \nThese excluded exhibits comprise  PX 195, PX 198–202, PX 204, PX 207, PX 208, PX 210, PX \n215, PX 221, PX 226, and PX 233 .  Also excluded are PX 263 and PX 269, which concern distinct \ntechnology  like Voice & Audio  Activity and YouTube.  The motion is also granted with respect to \nmost of PX 153, as it is overly long and far afield, concerning collection of data through the web, \nnot apps.  That said, t o the extent any evidence therein speaks directly to whether Google learned \nthat its WAA and (s)WAA disclosures suggested something to its users that was untrue, it may be \nadmissible.  The same holds true for  PX 152 . \nThe motion is denied as to exhibits  consisting of  statement s Google’s CEO made about its \ngeneral privacy practices ; such evidence is relevant and not sufficiently prejudicial to exclude \nunder Rule 403.  See PX 6, PX 28, PX 132, PX 134, PX 217, PX 249 and 250 .  The motion is also \ndenied  with respect to evidence concerning settings that control data storage when WAA  is turned \non; such evidence may yet be admissible, given that WAA can be turned on and (s)WAA can still \nbe turned off.  See PX 133, PX 154, PX 236, PX 243, PX 244, PX273, and PX 277.   \n \n6. Preclude Plaintiffs from  Calling Chris Palmer and Kent Walker for \nImpeachment Testimony  \nGoogle next moves in limine to preclude Plaintiffs from calling Chris Palmer or Kent \nWalker to testify at trial.  Palmer is an engineer who worked on the Google Chrome web \nbrowser’s “Incognito Mode,” which formed the basis of the Brown litigation that Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel litigated alongside the instant action.  Walker is Google’s Chief Legal Officer , who \ndirected in 2008 that Google’s internal chat history should be turned off by default —a directive \nthat resulted in sanctions against Google for failure to preserve certain messages.  See In re \nGoogle Play Store Antitrust Lit.,  No. 3:21 -md-2981 -JD (N.D. Cal.)  at Dkt. No. 469 .  Plaintiffs did Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 14 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  not include either witness in their pretrial disclosures,  so under Rule 25(a)(3)(A), neither Palmer \nnor Walker is eligible to testify unless they testify  “solely for impeachment.”  Google asserts that \nany evidence Palmer and Walker could provide would either be irrelevant to this case or , \nparadoxically,  would have “independent relevancy to the merits of the case” such that “the \nevidence is not solely for impeachment” and thus inadmissible given Plaintiffs’ failure timely to \ndisclose.  See Clear -View Techs.,  Inc. v. Rasnick , No. 13 -cv-2744 -BLF, 2015 WL 3509384, at *7 \n(N.D. Cal. 2015 ) (cleaned up).  \nPlaintiffs respond that both witnesses could provide testimony responsive  to an argument \nGoogle’s expert Donna Hoffman  espoused in her report: the notion that Google has a “culture of \nconstant improvement and evolution.”  See Dkt. 473 -2 ¶ 19.  Likening the situation to opening the \ndoor, Plaintiffs say they reserve the right to call Walker or Palmer and respond to any attempts by \nGoogle to assert a character of encouraging employees to voice privacy concerns.  As a middle \ngroun d, Plaintiffs represent that they will not use Walker or Palmer if Google refrains from \narguing that its general culture is committed to addressing user privacy conce rns. \nThe motion is granted.3  Plaintiffs seek to use these witnesses, not to impeach Hoffman, \nbut “as a guise to present substantive evidence to the  jury that would be otherwise inadmissible.”  \nDiaz v. Pima Cnty. , 34 F. App’x 309, 311 (9th Cir. 2002)  (quoting United States v. Gilbert , 57 \nF.3d 709, 711 (9th Cir. 1995) (per curiam)) .  In particular, it appears they want to assert the second \nelement of their intrusion upon seclusion claim —that Google acted intentionally —by introducing \notherwise inadmissible evidence about Google’s general privacy -related conduct, stretching back \nwell beyond the class period an d enveloping far more products and conduct than the (s)WAA \nswitch, GA4F, GMA, and SDKs at issue here.  Having failed to disclose either witness as required \nby the Federal Rules, Plaintiffs cannot now, at the eleventh hour, smuggle them in as so -called \nimpeachment witnesses.  Indeed, Plaintiffs repeatedly claim they have the right to use the \n \n3 Defendant’s motion to quash the subpoena seeking Walker’s testimony, as well as the related \nmotion to expedite the hearing on that motion, are  effectively granted  given that this order \nprecludes his testimony.  To be clear, he will not testify at this trial.

Preclude Mention of Google’s Incognito Mode  \nIn this follow -on motion to the one just described,  Google seeks to exclude eleven exhibits \non Plaintiffs’ proposed list for trial.  Broadly speaking, Google characterizes these exhibits as “re -\nlitigating the Brown v. Google  incognito case in this courtroom.”  Mot. at 3.  Ten of the exhibits \nwere produced in discovery of that case, not this one, and they all pertain to Incognito Mode, not \ndata tracking of (s)WAA -off Google users.   Plaintiffs respond that the exhibits speak to Google’s \nintent, motive, and ab sence of mistake, urging the court to deny the motion or at least defer ruling \nto see if these issues actually manifest at trial.  \nWith respect to the ten exhibits Plaintiffs lifted from  the docket of  a distinct  case, the \nmotion is granted.  If they speak to Google’s intent or motives, they do so in the context of \nIncognito Mode, not (s)WAA or any of the other issues in this case.  \nAs to the only exhibit at issue in this motion that Google did produce in this case, the \nmotion is denied.  PX -31 is relevant to Google’s knowledge of its users’ understanding  about its \ndata collection practices; it directly references the Pinecone studies, discussed supra  with respect \nto Google ’s fourth motion in limine .  Those studies, and what they say about what Google knew \nduring the relevant time period, are admissible.  \n8. Exclude Discovery Meet -and-Confer Communications from  Being Entered as \nEvidence  \nIn its eighth motion in limine , Google moves to exclude meet -and-confer communications \nbetween the parties’ counsel during discovery.  Plaintiffs represent that the parties are negotiating \non this motion in limine  and request deferring any ruling.  Good cause appearing, the motion is \ndeferred until at least August 8.  The parties are encouraged to resolve this dispute  by stipulation.  \n9. Exclude Evidence and Arguments Relating to Plaintiffs’ Emotional Distress  \nIn its ninth and perhaps most ambiguous motion in limine , Google requests the court Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 16 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “preclude Plaintiffs from introducing any evidence and argument regarding Plaintiffs’ alleged \nemotional distress damages.”  Mot. at 3.  Without identifying any particular testimony or exhibits, \nGoogle complains that Plaintiffs are not pursuing a class -wide  emotional distress damages model \nand never proffered a damages expert in that regard; as a result, introducing evidence of \nindividualized harms would potentially mislead the jury and could prejudice Google, which would \nneed to cross -examine on those issue s based on a limited record and with scant advance notice.   \n The motion is denied  without prejudice .  Its request  to preclude “any evidence and \nargument” abou t a key component of the case is overbroad .  The operative complaint refers \nrepeatedly to  alleged  emotional distress, and evidence of any distress would support Plaintiffs ’ \nburden on several elements of the claims, including but not limited to whether they were harmed \nand whether Google’s actions are highly offensive.  Plaintiffs also seek nominal emotional distress \ndamages.  Of course , trial will focus on comm on proof addressing common questions, and over -\nemphasis on the individual distress of any particular plaintiff would not be permitted .  However,  to \npreclude “any” evidence of this sort would hamstring Plaintiffs’ ability to present their case.   \n10. Exclude Evidence and Arguments Relating to Third -Party App Compliance \nwith  Google Analytics 4 Firebase’s Terms of Service  \nGoogle moves to preclude any evidence and argument regarding third -party applications’ \ncompliance (or lack thereof) with Google’s disclosures.  Google highlights the class certification \norder in this case, which states “sWAA disclosures and Google’s Privac y Policy are the only \nrelevant materials for analysis, and are the same for all class members.”  Rodriguez , 2024 WL \n38302, at *8 (N.D. Cal. 2024)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nAs Defendant has explained previously, Google required app developers who use its GA4F \nSDK to disclose that it stores and processes the apps’ analysis of their users’ activities.  See, e.g. , \nDkt. No. 383 -2 (MSJ App’x. A -2, Sample of Historic GA4F Terms of Service) at 40.  Defendant \nappears to fear that Plaintiffs will contend to the jury that third -party app disclosures to users \nabout this practice were inadequate, something not squarely at issue in this case.  \nPlaintiffs respond that they are not going to make the policies a cornerstone of their case, Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 17 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n18 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  highlighting the fac t that they have not included any app -specific privacy policies on their exhibit \nlist.  “No party should compare one app’s privacy policy with another app’s privacy policy and \nmake arguments about the differences . . . because the parties agree that there a re no app -specific \nprivacy policies that relate to Google’s privacy controls.”  Opp. Br. at 2.  That said, Plaintiffs \nreserve the right to highlight the extent to which Google never required third -party apps to \n“explicitly notify” user s about the “particular conduct” at issue —in this instance, Google’s \ncollection and use of (s)WAA -off data.  See Calhoun v. Google, LLC , 113 F.4th 1141, 1147 (9th \nCir. 2024)  (“For consent to be actual, the disclosures must ‘explicitly notify ’ users of the conduct \nat issue. ” (citation omitted)) ; see also  Summary Judgment Order at 1107  (holding that “consent is \nonly effective if directed to the particular conduct, or to substantially the same conduct”).    \nAs discussed with respect to Plaintiffs’ seventh motion in limine , this case is about the \nrelationship between Google and Plaintiffs .  Third -party app  disclosures to Plaintiffs, and \nGoogle’s disclosures to third -party apps,  do not speak to whether Plaintiffs’  privacy expectations  \nwith respect to (s)WAA -off data collection are  reasonable , nor the scope of their consent.  Thus, \nevidence that Google did or did not ensure third -party app compliance with its own requirement to \nget user consent for its GA4F data collection is relevant only inasmuch as Plaintiffs seek to rebut \nGoogle’s argument that it did not act in a highly offensive manner.  \n11. Exclude Evidence and Arguments Relating to Sensitive Apps and Data  \nGoogle next asks the court to prohibit Plaintiffs from introducing evidence or argument \nabout third -party apps that are not listed in the operative complaint or about “sensitive apps (such \nas healthcare, health insurance, and finance apps) that are not representative  of the third -party apps \nused by all class members. ”  Mot. at 3.   It appears to fear, based on portions of Schneier’s expert \nreport (discussing, inter alia , abortion rights), that Plaintiffs will discuss “apps they never even \nused” or “plac[e] u ndue emphasis on certain apps because they wish to inflame the jury.”  Mot. at \n5.  “If Plaintiffs spend the whole trial using apps like the New  York Times app and the Nike app \nas examples, so be it.  If they make a healthcare app a central  feature of their case, they will have \ndeviated from the logic of the Court’s certification Order, and  from basic fairness. ”  Id.  Crucial to Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 18 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n19 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the claimed unfairness is its view that the discovery in this case failed to provide any evidence \n“that any sensitive data was collected,” such as those involving location data at abortion clinics.  \nPlaintiffs maintain tha t discovery revealed the extent to which Google’s SDKs are \nimbedded in many of the most popular medical, religious, financial, and social media third -party \napps.  Their expert determined that, through GA4F, Google automatically collects information \nabout in -app purchases, when apps are installed, the start of each app activity session, and users’ \nengagement with the app.  In Plaintiffs ’ view, such interactions could  reveal a person’s political \nleanings, sexual orientation, reproductive decisions, spiritual beliefs , and medical information . \nThe motion is denied without prejudice.  Plaintiffs should be cognizant of the need not to \nmake this case  about a particular app .  The relevant question is whether class members who shared \ncommon conduct had an objective, reasonable expectation of privacy  in their third -party app data  \nbased on Google’s representations to them about the (s)WAA switch .  Evidence about any one \napp, and how sensitive the data in that app would be, is definitionally not classwide.  The common \nconduct is that the class members  had (s)WAA switched off and that Google nevertheless \ncollected data via its SDKs embedded in third -party apps .  It would be inappropriate  (and \nwasteful ) to detour trial into the brambles about any one plaintiff’s third -party app activity.  This is \nespecially true if Plaintiffs aim to focus on an app they have no direct evidence any one in the class \nused.  That said, Plaintiffs may offer  limited  examples of the type of data that Google’s  SDKs \ncollect  in striving to prove  they had an objectively reasonable privacy expectation or that the \nactivity was highly offensive and/or harmful.  \n12. Exclude Evidence and Arguments Relating to Defendant’s Total Revenue  \nGoogle finally moves in limine  to preclude the introduction of PX -429, which is its parent \ncompany Alphabet Inc.’s 10 -K 2024, and to preclude evidence or argument about Alphabet and \nGoogle’s total revenues.   \nFirst, Google contends none  of Plaintiffs’ models for disgorgement, actual damages, or \npunitive damages require evidence of Alphabet’s total revenue , so it is irrelevant to the fact issues \nin dispute .  Introducing evidence of its parent company’s assets  might  unduly  prejudice the jury Case 3:20-cv-04688-RS     Document 587     Filed 08/06/25     Page 19 of 20 \nORDER RE : MOTIONS  IN LIMINE  \nCASE NO.  20-cv-04688 -RS \n20 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  against Google based on hostility toward  big technology companies, especially  since Plaintiffs \nvoluntarily dismissed allegations against Alphabet in 2020.  Plaintiffs sidestep these arguments in \ntheir opposition brief, focusing instead on Google’s revenues and only arguing in the introductory \nparagraph that, because they have arguments about Google’s revenues, “the total revenue that \nAlphabet regularly generates” is an important  touchstone for “the jury to understand how the \ndamages Plaintiffs seek are reas onable.” Opp. Br. at 1.   \nGoogle’s motion is granted as to PX -429.  Plaintiffs provide no compelling response to the \nwell-reasoned arguments Google makes about not including the Alphabet 10 -K.  The relevant \nuniverse of disgorgement evidence is limited to PX 418 through PX 428, which contain Google’s \nfinancial data for the specific advertising product lines involved in this case (i.e., App Promo, \nAdMob, and Ad Manager).  Google also objects to Pla intiffs’ demonstrative exhibits, which show \nthe requested disgorgement figures as a smal l sliver of Google’s overall U.S. ad revenue.  Google \nis correct that the appropriate comparison juxtaposes  the alleged unjust enrichment against \nGoogle’s  total U.S. ad revenue through App Promo, AdMob, and Ad Manager .  Including other \nU.S. advertising revenue generated, such as  through Youtube or Google’s myriad other ventures , \nis unfairly prejudicial because it misidentifies  the relevant comparison.   In other words, because \nthis case is limited to allegations about (s)WAA -off data collection and use, demonstratives \ninaptly referencing data collected through other channels are  subject to exclusion.  \nV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals addressed a class-action lawsuit involving a research collaboration between Google and the University of Chicago to develop software using AI to predict healthcare needs using anonymized patient data. The plaintiff, Matt Dinerstein, alleged privacy violations and breaches of contract concerning the handling of his medical records. However, the court dismissed the case, affirming that Dinerstein lacked standing as he did not sufficiently allege concrete or imminent injury resulting from the data transfer.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Dinerstein had Article III standing to sue, given the alleged injuries related to privacy violations, breach of contract, and consumer fraud.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Dinerstein failed to adequately allege a concrete injury, as the purported harms were speculative and lacked sufficient immediacy or concreteness to confer standing. As a result, the case was dismissed for lack of standing.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A man named Matt was upset because a hospital shared his patient information with Google to help develop new software to predict health needs. He felt this was a breach of privacy and sued. But the court said he didn't have a strong enough personal harm to justify a lawsuit because he didn't show any real damage or imminent threat from what happened. So, they dismissed his case.",

This class- action lawsuit arises from a \nresearch collaboration  between Google and the University of \nChicago  together with its affiliated Medical Center . (We will \nrefer to the latter two as “the University”  unless the context Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 332 No. 20-3134 \nrequires otherwise. ) Harnessing the power of artificial \nintelligence , the research partners aspired to develop soft-\nware  capable of  anticipat ing patients’  future healthcare  \nneeds . If successful , the software promised  to reduce  medi-\ncal complications , eliminate  unnecessary hospital stays , and, \nultimately, improve  patients’ healthcare outcomes . \nAs an initial step in the research effort , the University  de-\nlivered several years of anonymized patient medical records  \nto Google , thus  suppl ying  it with the information needed to \n“train ” the software’s algorithms . A Data Use Agreement  \ngoverned the transfer . Restricting Google’s  use of the rec-\nords  to a list of specific research -related activities , the \nagreement expressly prohibited the company  from attempt-\ning to identify any  patient  whose records were  disclosed .  \nThe anonymized electronic records subject to the agree-\nment  included those of Matt Dinerstein, twice an inpatient at \nthe hospital during the period covered by the  records  disclo-\nsure.  Dinerstein sued  Google and the University on behalf of \nhimself and a class of other  patient s whose anonymize d \nrecords were disclose d. He alleged s everal theories of liabil-\nity. He first claimed that the University had breached either \nan express or an implied contract  traceable to a privacy \nnotice he received and  an authorization he signed upon each \nadmission  to the Medical Center. Alternatively, he asserted a \nclaim for unjust enrichment. Citing the same notice and \nauthorization, he also  alleged that the University had re-\nneged on its promise of patient confidentiality and therefore \nviolated the Illino is Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Busi-\nness Practices Act, 815 I LL. COMP. STAT. 505/1 et seq . Against  \nGoogle , he asserted  claims for unjust enrichment and tor-\ntious interfer ence  with his contract with  the University. Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 3 \nFinally, he brought  a privacy claim against  all defendants \nbased  on allegations of intrusion upon seclusion . \nThe district judge dismissed the consumer -fraud  claim \nfor lack of  standing and the rest of the suit  for failure to state \na claim. We agree with  her decision to dismis s the case, but \nour analysis  begins and ends with standing . Dinerstein has \nnot adequately alleged standing to pursue  any of his claims . \nTo sue in federal court, a plaintiff must plausibly allege  (and \nlater prove)  that he has suf fered a n injury in fact that is  \nconcrete  and particularized, actual or immin ent, and tracea-\nble to the defendant’s conduct. T he injuries Dinerstein  \nallege s lack  plausibility,  concreteness, or imminence  (or \nsome combination of the three ). Because the complaint  fails \nto plausibly allege a n injury  in fact, we affirm but modify the \njudgment to reflect a jurisdictional dismissal for lack of \nstanding.  \nI. Background \nOur factual account is drawn from Dinerstein’s amended \ncomplaint . We begin  with a description of his  inpatient stays \nat the University Medical Center —and  more particularly, \nthe paperwork he received at the start of each admission . \nDinerstein alleges that he was first admitted to the Medical \nCenter  on June 4, 2015 , and was discharged three days later . \nHe was then readmitted on June  25, this time for a two- night \nstay. Upon each admission Dinerstein received a Notice of \nPrivacy Practices detailing the University’s confidentiality \nobligations and the circumstances in which it might use or disclose patient medical information. Relevant here, the \nnotice stated that the University would  obtain “written \npermission” for the sale of such  information.  Patient p ermis-\nsion was not required, however, for the University to use or Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 334 No. 20-3134 \nshare the information in limited research -related circum-\nstances. In addition to the n otice, Dinerstein  received and \nsigned an Admission and Outpatient Agreement and Au-\nthorization . By doing so he affirmed that he understood  that \nhis medical information might  be shared for approved \nresearch purposes and that if so, he would “not be entitled to \nany compensation.” He further acknowledged that “all efforts” would “be made to protect [his] privacy” and that “any use of [his] medical information” would comply with both the n otice a nd “federal and state laws.” \nDuring Dinerstein’s two hospital stays,  the University \ncompiled records of his  vital readings , medical procedures, \nprescriptions, test results, and diagnoses. The records also  \ncontained  demographic information . After each  discharge \nfrom the  hospital, the Medical Center  maintained  electronic \ncopies o f his patient records.  \nApproximately two years after Dinerstein’s hospital vis-\nits, Google announced that it had partnered with the Univer-\nsity to research new healthcare technology. With the help of \nmachine  learning, the research partners aspired to develop \npredictive modeling software t hat would  improve  the ability \nof medical providers  to forecast their patients’ medical needs \nand, in turn , to tailor  subsequent medical care. As described \nin promotional statements, the  project had the potential  to \nprevent medical complications, reduce hospital visits, and \nimprove overall health and well -being.\n1 \n \n1 Matt Wood, UChicago Medicine Collaborates with Google to Use Machine \nLearning for Better Health Care, UCHICAGO  MEDICINE  (May 17, 2017) , \nhttps://www.uchicagomedicine .org/forefront/research -and-discoveries-\narticles/uchicago -medicine -collaborates -with -google -to-use-machine -\nlearning -for-better -health- care.  Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 5 \nTo reliably predict medical outcomes , the models needed \nextensive information from which  to learn. The  University \nthus agreed to transfer to Google a large set of  anonymized \npatient medical records. A Data Use Agreement executed by \nthe partne rs in December 2016 governed the transfer. While \nmost of the agreement’s provisions are irrelevant  for our \npurposes , a few deserve mention . First, the agreement \ncontemplated that befor e disclo sure  the University would \nstrip the  patient records  of all direct  identifying informatio n \nexcept the dates of medical events  and services. Second,  the \nagreement delineated the records’ authorized uses.  In par-\nticular , Google was permitted  to use  the records  only to \nidentif y key medical information , to develop predictive \nmodels , and to assess the models’ efficacy . It could neither \ndisclose information from within  the record s nor use the \nrecords  in contravention of  federal law.  Most importantly, \nthe agreement strictly  prohibited Google from using the \nrecords “to identify any individual.” Third, if the parties’ \nresearch efforts proved successful, the agreement  granted \nthe University a perpetual license to use the predictive models  for its own “internal  non- commercial  research  \npurposes. ” \nThe batch of medical records covered by the Data Use \nAgreement  spanned several years . Specifically , the agree-\nment directed the University to transfer to Google anony-mized records generated from all inpatient, outpatient, and \nemergency adult -patient encounters  between January 1, \n2010, and June 30, 2016. Both of Dinerstein’s overnight stays \noccurred in June 2015 , so his medical records were included \nin the set disclosed to Go ogle.  Dinerstein alleges that  the \nUniversity  never obtained his consent —written or other- Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 336 No. 20-3134 \nwise —for  the third -party record disclosure.  Nor did Google \nseek  permission to use  his records.  \nDinerstein filed suit against  the University and Google  \nseeking damages a nd injunctive relief on behalf of himself \nand a class of patients whose anonymized records were \ndisclosed . He raised seven claims for relief . Against the \nUniversity he alleged claims for  breach of an express or  an \nimplied contract  premised on the n otice he received and  the \nauthorization  he signed upon each admission  to the Medical \nCenter. More to the point, Dinerstein alleged that in ex-\nchange for hi s payment and personal medical information , \nthe University  had agreed  to protect  and secure  his infor-\nmation . By sharing it with Google, the University  had failed \nto uphold its end of the bargain.  As an alternative to his \ncontract claims, Dinerstein  sought damages for unjust  \nenrich ment . He also alleged a claim for violation of  the \nIllinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices \nAct. This statutory claim rest ed on the alleged  broken prom-\nises, which Dinerstein asserted  the University never intend-\ned to keep in the first place . \nTurning to Google , Dinerstein alleged that the com pany  \nhad tortious ly interfere d with his contract wit h the Universi-\nty. H e also asserted  a claim for unjust enrichment based on \nthe company’s receipt of  valuable  patient  medical records . \nFinally, Dinerstein brought a tort claim against Google and \nthe Univers ity for invasion of  privacy . More specifically, he \nalleged that they had intruded upon his seclusion  by send-\ning and  receiving  his sensitive medical information.  \nRelevant to th is last theory of liability , Dinerstein claimed \nthat while he was an inpatient  at the Medical Center, he  had \nused a smartphone with geolocation capabilities . Because he Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 7 \nhad also downloaded v arious Google apps , he alleged that \nthe phone  granted  the company  access to  his precise location \nduring every moment of his  hospital st ays. He further \nalleged that if Googl e compared his location data with the \ninsufficiently anonymized p atient records, it could easily \nascertain his identit y and uncover  “intimate private details” \nin his  medical histories . And he alleged that Google could do \nthe same thing  with other class members’ geo location data.  \nThe defendants moved to dismiss  under Rule s 12(b)(1) \nand (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . They  argu ed \nthat Dinerstein  had not  allege d a concrete  injury to support \nArticle III standing and, alternatively, that he had  not state d \na cognizable claim.  The judge granted the motion, a greeing \nprimarily with the  latter argument and dismiss ing the \ncomplaint in its entirety.   \nOn the standing issue, the judge  construed  Dinerstein ’s \nalleg ations about a lost  benefit of the bargain as sufficient to \nsupport standing to sue on the contract  (and contract -\nalternative ) theories  against both the University  and Google . \nDinerstein v. Google, LLC , 484 F. Supp. 3d 561, 574 (N.D. Ill. \n2020). S he also reasoned that the allegations about a n inva-\nsion of privacy —in the form of a  wrongful disclosure of his \nprivate medical information —support ed Dinerstein’s stand-\ning to sue  for intrusion upon seclusion . Id. at 575. But t he \njudge  dismissed the consumer -fraud  claim  for lack of stand-\ning because “[a] claim under [the Illinois Consumer Fraud \nand Deceptive Business Practices Act]  requires a showing of \nactual damages,” which Dinerstein  had not alleged.  Id. at 579 \n(citing 815 I LL. COMP. STAT. 505/10a(a)). \nMoving on , the judge dismissed the claims for breach of \ncontract —express or implied—f or failure to state a cogniza- Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 338 No. 20-3134 \nble claim b ecause Dinerstein  had not adequately pleaded \neconomic damage s, a required element under Illinois law . Id. \nat 590–93; F ED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).  Next , the judge noted but \nchose  not to decide the question whether Dinerstein’s claim  \nfor tortious  interference with contract necessarily fell with \nthe other contract claims. Instead , she held that the claim  \nfailed for a separate reason: Dinerstein had not sufficiently  \npleaded that Google  had intentionally caused the  University’s  \nbreach  of contract. Id. at 593. (Intent is n ecessary to state a \nclaim of tortious interference with contract  in Illinois.  HPI \nHealth Care Servs., Inc. v. Mt. Vernon Hosp., Inc., 545 N.E.2d \n672, 676 (Ill. 1989).) \nTurning to the p rivacy claim, the judge observed that \nDinerstein had re characterized his original intrusion -upon -\nseclusion  claim as a novel tort claim for breach of medical \nconfidentiality , a theory n ot yet recognized in Illinois. The \njudge thought it unlikely that the Illinois Supreme Court \nwould  recognize such a claim, so she declined to permit \nDinerstein to p ursue it  in federal court.  That left only the \nunjust -enrichment claim s. Because unjust enrichment is not \nan independent cause of action in Illinois,  the judge dis-\nmissed  those claim s as well . Dinerstein appealed.  \nII. Discussion  \nThe dismissal order rests partly on a fai lure to allege  \nArticle  III standing but mostly on the judge’s conclusion that \nDinerstein failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . Our review of either basis for dismissal is de novo . \nNowlin v. Pritzker , 34 F.4th 629, 632 (7th Cir. 2022). T he \nparties  primarily focus on  whether the amended  complain t \nsatisfies the statutory and common -law pleading require-\nments particular to each claim. But the threshold question is Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 9 \nstanding , which “is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.” \nNettles v. Midland Funding LLC , 983 F.3d 896, 899 (7th Cir. \n2020).  \nStanding doctrine traces its origins  to Article III  of the \nConstitution, which grants federal courts the power to \nresolve “Cases” and  “Controversies.” U.S.  CONST . art. III, § 2.  \nThe doctrine’s elements are well  established and familiar . To \nsue in federal court, a plaintiff must have suffered (1) a \nconcrete, particularized, and actual or imminent injury  (an \n“injury in fact” ) (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant \nand (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). \n“[A]t the pleading stage, the plaintiff must clearly  … allege \nfacts demonstrating each element.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , \n578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (quotation marks omitted). Moreo-\nver, “standing is not dispensed in gross; rather, plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim that they press \nand for each form of relief that they seek.” TransUnion LLC v. \nRamirez , 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2208 (2021). \nLike many of our recent cases concerning Article III \nstanding , this one  hinges on the injury -in-fact element , and \nin particular, the concreteness and imminence requirements.  \nWhile the concreteness requirement examines  the substance \nof a plaintiff’s asserted injury , the imminence requirement \nmeasures its likelihood. In other words , to provide a basis to \nsue in federal court, an inj ury must exist  “in both a qualita-\ntive and [a] temporal sense.” Whitmore v. Arkansas , 495 U.S. \n149, 155 (1990).  \nStarting with the qualitative aspe ct, “[a] concrete injury  \nmust be de facto; that is, it must  actually exist.” Spokeo, \n578 U.S. at 340 (quotation marks omitted). Endorsing the Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3310 No. 20-3134 \nterm’s “usual meaning,”  the Supreme Court has  described a \nconcrete injury as one that is “real [] and not abstract.” Id. \n(quotation marks omitted). Both tangible and intangible \nharms  may fit th e bill, even if tangible  harms  like “physical \nor monetary injur[ies]” are  perhaps more intuitively con-\ncrete. TransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at 2204. As the Court has ex-\nplained, o ur task—especially when the  plaintiff assert s an  \nintangible harm —is to assess whether the  alleged  injury has \n“a close relationship to a harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts .” Id. \n(quotation marks omitted). The inquiry asks whether the plaintiff has “identified a close historical or common -law \nanalogue” for his asserted injury.  Id. Put another way , when \nreviewing a  plaintiff’s alleged injury for concreteness,  \n“[h]istory and tradition remain our ever -present g uides.” \nPierre v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc. , 29 F.4th 934, 938 (7th Cir. \n2022). \nImminence is more of an “elastic concept.”  Lujan , \n504 U.S. at 564 n.2. While it  lacks a precise framework , the \nbasic function of the imminence requirement  “is to ensure \nthat the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III \npurposes.” Id. Accordingly, a plaintiff who has not suffered \na past harm  cannot  simply  rest on allegations  that he may \nsuffer some “possible future injury,” Whitmore , 495 U.S. at \n158, “at some indefinite future time ,” Lujan , 504 U.S. at 564 \nn.2. His threatened injury instead must be “ certainly impend-\ning” to satisfy Article III.  Id. And importantly, while an \nimminent risk of future harm may suffice to support stand-\ning to sue for prospective  relie f (i.e., an injunction), a claim for  \ndamages requires a concrete harm that has in fact occurred. \nTransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at 2210–11. Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 11 \nWith these fundamental standing principles in mind, we \nturn to the claims  presented  in this case. At the outset, \nhowever, we note  that Dinerstein omitted from his opening \nbrief any discussion about the  claims for unjust enrichment \nor breach  of an implied contract. By doing so, he abandoned \nthese claims on appeal , and  we need not consider them.  See \nWhite v. United States , 8 F.4th 547, 552 (7th Cir. 2021); see also \nFED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(8)(A) (requiring th at the appellant’s \nbrief include his  “contentions and the reasons for them”). \nWhat remains  is the privacy claim, the  claim for breach of an \nexpress contract, the consumer -fraud  claim , and the claim \nfor tortious  interference with contract . We address each in \nturn.  \nA.  Privacy Claim  \nWe begin  with the alleged breach of privacy  because the \nasserted  injury  underlying this claim is  common to all claims \nthat remain live  on appeal . In other words, our resolution of \nthe standing issue on this claim necessarily resolves portions \nof others, streamlining our discussion of the  claims  that \nfollow . \nBefore diving into the standing analysis, we must discern \nwhat, exactly, Dinerstein’s privacy  claim is. His complaint \ncharacterizes the defendants’  conduct as a common -law \nintrusion  upon seclusion, which is potentially actionable \nwhen the alleged tortfeasor  “intentionally intrudes, physical-\nly or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another.” \nRESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS § 652(B) ( AM. LAW INST. \n1977) [hereinafter RESTATEMENT ]. The Illinois Supreme Court \nhas adopted this definition  of the tort, describ ing the pur-\npose of the seclusion right as “protecting a person from \nanother’s prying into their physical boundaries or affairs.” Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3312 No. 20-3134 \nW. Bend Mut . Ins. Co. v. Krishna Schaumburg Tan, Inc. , \n183 N.E.3d 47, 58 ( Ill. 2021) ; see also Lovgren v. Citizens First \nNat’l Bank, 534 N.E.2d 987, 988–89 (Ill. 1989). \nApparently  accepting  that neither defendant’s  conduct \nfits the elements of th is tort, Dinerstein  abandon ed his \nintrusion -upon -seclusion theory  below , as the district judge \nnoted . Dinerstein , 484 F. Supp. 3d at 594. In his re spon se to  \nthe defendants’  motion to dismiss , Dinerstein  reframe d his \nprivacy claim  as a breach  of medical confidentiality , a novel \ncause o f action that posits a common -law duty of medical \nprovider s to maintain  patient confidentiality. Several  states \nhave recogn ized some variety of this  tort. See, e.g., Lawson v. \nHalpern -Reiss, 212 A.3d 1213, 1219 (Vt. 2019); Byrne v. Avery \nCtr. for Obstetrics & Gynecology, P.C., 175 A.3d 1 , 17 (Conn. \n2018); McCormick v. England , 494 S.E.2d 431, 437 (S.C. Ct. \nApp.  1997). But Illinois is not one of the m. Dinerstein there-\nfore invited the district judge, sitting in diversity,  to hold \nthat the Illinois Su preme Court  would recognize the tort \nunder Illinois law . See Zahn v. N. Am. Power & Gas, LLC , \n815 F.3d 1082, 1087 (7th Cir. 2016) ( [W]e must use our own \nbest judgment to estimate how the [I llinois] Supreme Court \nwould rule as to its law.”  (quotation marks omitted)).  As \nwe’ve noted, the judge declined that invitation . Dinerstein , \n484 F. Supp. 3d at 595.  \nMore importantly for our purposes, however, Dinerstein \nhas chosen  to stick with the new  version  of his  privacy  claim \non appeal. H e premise s his privacy -related challenges  \nexclusively on the novel medical- confidentiality theory. \nFollowing his lead,  then,  we focus our discussion o f standing \non the reframed privacy theory .  Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 13 \nDinerstein presents his privacy injury in two forms , one \nbackward -looking and the other forward -looking. But \nconsidered in either direction —past  or future —his asserted \ninjury does not establish standing to sue.  \n1.  Past Harm  \nWe start with the backward -looking form of injury . Cru-\ncially, Dinerstein does not allege  that Google has already \nused the  disclosed  patient records to discern  his identity . \nInstead he focus es on the conduct of the University , arguing  \nthat the record transfer was itself  an actionable  invasion of \nhis medical privacy . This is so, Dinerstein asserts, regardless  \nof whether Google ever actually  identifies  him .  \nBy referencing a common -law privacy invasion, \nDinerstein  attempts to compare his asserted injury to a harm \n“traditionally recognized as providing a basis for lawsuits in \nAmerican courts.” TransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at 2204. In other \nwords, he engages with the proper inquiry under the \nSupreme  Court’s recent standing caselaw.  But as we’ve  \nexplained, an “invasion of privacy” is not a standalone tort; \nthe term “encompasse[ s] four theories of wrongdoing: intru-\nsion upon seclusion, appropriation of a person’s name or \nlikeness , publicity given to private life, and publicity placing \na person in a false light.” Pucillo v. Nat’l Cred it Sys., Inc., \n66 F.4th 634, 639–40 (7th Cir. 2023) (quoting Persinger v. S w. \nCredit Sys., L.P., 20 F.4th 1184, 1192 (7th Cir. 2021) ); see also \nRESTATEMENT  §§ 65 2A–652E. And because TransUnion \nrequires us to nail down a particular common -law analogue, \nwe must assess whether any of the  recognized privacy torts \nis sufficiently analogous to Dinerstein’s asserted injury . If \nnot, no concrete harm. “N o concrete harm, no standing.” \nTransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at 2214. Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3314 No. 20-3134 \nOf the four  traditional  privacy tort theories , the closest \ncomparator to Dinerstein’s new theory is probably the tort of \npublicity given to private life , which  occurs when someone \n“gives publicity ” to a “highly offensive”  matter “concerning \nthe private life of another ” that “is not of legitimate concern  \nto the public .” R ESTATEMENT § 652D. Yet Dinerstein has \nidentified no case in which a court has permitted a plaintiff \nto bring  a public -disclosure tort  premised on the dissemina-\ntion of anonymized  information .2 Indeed, while  the relevant  \ncaselaw is sparse, we ’re skeptical that this alleged factual \nscenario  would  give rise to any injury at all —let alone one \nconcrete enough to support Article III standing . See, e.g.,  \nShulman v. Grp. W Prods., Inc., 955 P.2d 469, 489 n.12 (Cal. \n1998) (“[C]omplete lack of identification or identifiability \nwould seemingly defeat a private facts claim, as there could be no injury … .”); Harris ex rel. Harris v. Easton Pub l’g Co., \n483 A.2d 1377, 1385 (P a. 1984) (“Absent an ability to identify \nthe complainant, there can be no communicatio n and hence, \nno publicity.”); cf. Frobose v. Am. Sav. & Loan Ass’n , 152 F.3d \n602, 618 (7th Cir. 1998) (rejecting a false -light claim because \nthe communication neither mentioned the plaintiff by name nor made her “readily identifiable to the public”).  \nResisting this conclusion,  Dinerstein  contend s that the \nUniversity’s records were ins ufficiently anonymized. He \ncites a presentation from the 2017 Google Cloud Next con-\nference by Dr. Samuel Volchenboum, the University’s \nAssociate Chief Research Informatics Officer. Dinerstein argues that Dr. Volchenboum ’s presentation highlighted  \n \n2 Nor has Dinerstein identified a case in which a court has permitted a \nplaintiff to bring the novel  claim of breach of medical confidentiality in \ncircumstances like these.  Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 15 \nvarious deficiencies in the “typical de -identification pro-\ncess.”3 He contends that the  process risks leaving  identifying \nclues like the patient’s  age, place of residence, and family \nrelations  scattered  throughout the purportedly  “de -\nidentified” medical records . According to Dinerstein, s uch \nclues are routinely found  in the treating physician’ s “free -\ntext”  clinical notes . If these clues are pieced together, \nreidentification is supposedly simple . \nBut Dinerstein’s complaint omits any allegation s linking \nthe so -called “typical de -identification process”  described in \nDr. Volchenboum’s presentation  to the University’s de-\nidentification process here . Put differently,  just because  some \nde-identification process es might be deficient, we cannot \nassume that the University’s process was necessarily so.  To \nthe contrary,  the complaint acknowledges  that the chal-\nlenged record transfer occurred pursuant to the  Data Use \nAgreemen t, which state s that “the majority of [patient] \nidentifiers will be removed,” leaving only “actual dates of \n[medical] service and events.”  Dinerstein’s allegations  of \ninsufficient ano nymization  therefore do not cross the plausi-\nbility threshold. See Silha v. ACT, Inc., 807 F.3d 169, 174 (7th \nCir. 2015) ( “[T]he Twombly -Iqbal facial plausibility require-\nment for pleading a claim is incorporated into the standard for pleading subject matter  jurisdiction.”).  \nMoreover , Dinerstein appears to  concede that the Uni-\nversity  adequately discharged its de -identification obliga-\ntion. D escrib ing a jointly authored articl e from the \nUniversity and Google , the complaint  states  that although  \n \n3 Google Cloud Tech, Sensitive Data Management for Collaborative Research \nClouds (Go ogle Cloud Next '17) , YOUTUBE (Mar. 9, 2017), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Si956MXhWQ.   Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3316 No. 20-3134 \n“the [date  stamps] from the University patients’ records \nwere maintained,”  the records otherwise had been  “de-\nidentified.” And aside  from the date stamps, Dinerstein does \nnot pinpoint any information with in the records that  he \nthinks  should have been redacted  and was  not. Nor does he \nallege that the date stamps alone were impermissibly identi-\nfying. At most he alleges that some personally identifying \ninformation “may have evaded redaction ”—a hypothetical  \nthat does not  support his repeated but conclusory assertions  \nthat the University’s records  were insufficiently anony-\nmized.  “Such … bare assertion [s] of harm—unsupported by \nany concrete details ”—do not suffice to allege  a plausible , \nconcrete injury. Nowlin , 34 F.4th at 633. \n2.  Risk of Future Harm  \nThat bri ngs us to Dinerstein’s allegations of a forward -\nlooking privacy injury . Unlike the backward -lookin g injury, \nthis injury turns on Google’s conduct—or  more precisely, its  \nanticipated  conduct. At bottom , Dinerstein worries that  the \ndate stamps contained in the transferred medical records , \nalong with  the geolocation and demographic data collected \nfrom his smartphone apps, offer Google a “perfect formula-tion of data points” for later  reidentification. In other words, \nthe record transfer created a risk  that he might  someday be \nreidentified.  \nTo the extent that Dinerstein rests his claim for damages \non allegations of future risk, the argument is a nonstarter.  In \nTransUnion  the Supreme Court clarified that un less a “risk of \nfuture harm materializes,”  a plaintiff may rely on an “immi-\nnent and substantial” risk of harm only when  “pursu[ing] \nforward -looking, injunctive relief to prevent the harm from \noccurring.” 141 S. Ct. at 2210–11 (emphasis added). Or as our Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 17 \ncourt has summarized: “A plaintiff seeking money damages \nhas standing to sue in federal court only for harms that have \nin fact materialized.” Pierre, 29 F.4th at 938. Because Dinerstein  alleges no material harm arising  from the alleged  \nrisk of future reidentific ation, that future risk cannot support \nstanding to sue for damages. \nThe alleged risk does not support standing to sue for  in-\njunctive relief  either, though for a different reaso n: the risk \nDinerstein  alleges  is not sufficiently imminent.  To be sure, \nGoogle possesses a wealth of data about most , if not all, \nAmericans. Yet Dinerstein ignores that the governing Data \nUse Agreement  expressly  prohibited Google from using the \ntransferred medical records —either by themselves  or in \ntandem with data  already in its possession —“to identify any \nindividual.”  And e ven if th e contractual obligation  doesn’t \nitself  foreclose the risk  of reidentification , Dinerstein has not \nalleged that Google has taken any steps to identify him . Nor, \nfor that matter,  does he allege that Google intends  to do so. \nWithout any allegations to that effect, “we cannot simply \npresume a material risk of concrete harm.” TransUnion , \n141 S. Ct. at 2212 ( quoting Ramirez v. TransUnion LLC , \n951 F.3d 1008, 1040 (9th Cir. 2020) (opini on of McKeown, J.) ). \nThe risk of future injury is thus nowhere near “certainly \nimpending”; it is too speculative to satisfy the imminence \nrequirement for a suit for injunctive relief in federal court.  \nClapper v. Amnesty International  USA , 568 U.S. 398 (2013), \nsupports this  holding.  In Clapper  attorneys and human -rights \norganizations raised  constitutional  challenge s to § 1881a of \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, arguing that  \nindividuals with whom they  regularly  communicated were  \nprobable targets of foreign electronic surveillance under the Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 29 \nbecause common -law courts allowed a plaintiff  to vindicate \nhis contract ual rights without a further showing of injury, he \nneed not allege anything aside from t he University’s bare \nbreach of contract.  \nTrue , common -law courts historically heard  contract cas-\nes and awarded  nominal damages  even when the breach  \neither  “caused no loss” or “the amount of the loss [wa]s not \nproved.” R ESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF CONTRACTS § 346(2) (A M. \nLAW INST. 1981) ; see also  Springer v. Cleveland Clinic Emp. \nHealth Plan Total Care , 900 F.3d 284, 292–93 (6th Cir. 2018)  \n(Thapar, J., concurring) (“[Common -law courts] entertained \nbreach -of-contract claims even when no real loss  [could] be \nprove [n]. Such violations at least deserve d nominal damag-\nes … .” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Yet “[t]he \nrequirements of Art [icle] III are not satisfied merely because \na party … has couched [his]  request  for forms of relief \nhistorically associated with courts of law in terms that have a \nfamiliar ring to those trained in the legal process.” Valley \nForge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & \nState, Inc. , 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982).  \nMore importantly, however,  Spokeo and TransUnion  put \nan end to  federal courts hearing claims premised on nonex-\nistent injur ies—regardless  of historical pedigree.6 And the \nCourt’s recently announced  “historical -analogue test” does \nnot suggest  otherwise. That test asks whether a modern \ninjury  bears a “close relationship ” to a harm traditionally \n \n6 See William Baude, Standing in the Shadow of Congress , 2016 S. CT. REV. \n197,  217 (“[I]t is hard to see how nominal damages are fully consistent \nwith the logic of Spokeo. The very premise of nominal damages is that \none cannot show any ‘actual injury’ apart from the violation of the legal \nright itself.” (citing Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978)) ). Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3330 No. 20-3134 \nrecognized by common -law courts. TransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at \n2204. It does not, however, transform into a concrete factual \ninjury what the common law has historically  regarded as a  \nlegal injury . Put differently , a historical record is no talis-\nman. It is n ecessary, but not sufficient, to satisfy the \nArticle  III concreteness requirement . \nStill, because Dinerstein views Spokeo, TransUnion , and \nThole  as inapposite, he argues that our prior decision in J.P. \nMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. McDonald , 760 F.3d 646 (7th Cir. \n2014), binds us. Relevant here, at issue in J.P. Morgan was \nwhether a bank had standing to block an ongoing arbitration \nproceeding that two investors  had initiated after losing \napproximately a quarter of their  initial investment.  The \ncontracts governing the  investors’  account s included a \nforum- selection clause that required  disputes to be brought \nin either state or federal court. Id. at 649. Seeking to enforce \nthe forum- selection  provision, the bank sued the investors in \nfederal court . After months of litigation, the judge dismissed \nthe bank’s claims for lack of standing. Id. at 650. \nReversing the dismissal, we held that the bank had \nstanding to enforce the clause.  To form a bilat eral contract,  \neach party must  “take on one or more legally binding obliga-\ntions ,” we explained.  Id. “When one party fails to honor its \ncommitments, the other party to the contract suffers a legal injury sufficient to create standing even where that party seems not to have incurred monetary loss or other concrete \nharm.” Id. at 650–51. Because the bank had alleged that the \ninvestors had “violated the terms of th[eir ] bargain” by \nselecting  an improper  dispute -resolution forum, it had \nestablished standing to su e. Id. at 651. Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 31 \nDinerstein understandably seizes on  this favorable lan-\nguage, but he omits  the discussion that follows it. We went \non to explain  in J.P. Morgan  that the bank had “a very real \nfinancial interest in the arbitration” because it was statutori-\nly and contractually obligated to “foot the bill” for the \nresulting costs. Id. Given th is independent financial interest , \nthe standing question was not merely “one of abstract \nprinciple ”; it was yet another reason why the bank had \nstanding  to sue . Id.  \nThe concrete  harm s present in J.P. Morgan —being hauled \ninto an improper  forum and financing the resulting  costs—\ndistinguish it from this cas e. Moreover, while those  harms \nprevent us from needing to revisit  J.P. Morgan , we note that \nsome language in the opinion  is in tension with the Supreme \nCourt’s recent decisions in Spokeo and TransUnion . No longer \nis “a legal injury sufficient to create standing.” J.P. Morgan , \n760 F.3d at 651. “[U]nder Article III, an injury in law is not \nan injury in fact. Only those plaintiffs who have been con-\ncretely harmed ” by a defendant may sue  in federal court . \nTransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at  2205. Any  portion of our  opinion in \nJ.P. Morgan that suggests  otherwise cannot control  here.  \nFinally, we recognize that some tension also exists be-\ntween our analysis  here and  that of a few of our sister cir-\ncuits.  There is no direct con flict, however . For starters, many \nof the out -of-circuit decisions  pointing in the other direction \npredate TransUnion , a watershed decision on the standing \ndoctrine . See, e.g. , Mitchell v. Blue C ross Blue Shield , 953 F.3d \n529, 536 (8th Cir. 2020); Springer , 900 F.3d at 287; Katz v. \nPershing, LLC , 672 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2012). Of the circuits to \nconsider the issue post -TransUnion , we understand one to \nagree with our position , Perry v. Newsom , 18 F.4th 622, 632 Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3332 No. 20-3134 \n(9th Cir. 2021) (“An analogy to a traditionally recognized \ncause of action does not relieve a complainant of its burden to demonstrate an injury.”); one to leave it unresolved, \nGlennborough Home owners Ass’n v. U.S. Postal Serv ., 21 F.4th \n410, 415–16 (6th Cir. 2021) ( “We need not resolve these \nthorny questions today … .”) ; and one to come out the other \nway , Denning v. Bond Pharmacy, Inc., 50 F.4th 445, 451 ( 5th \nCir. 2022)  (“[A] breach of contract is a sufficient injury for \nstanding purposes.”) . But the Fifth Circuit’s opinion  in \nDenning  did not engage with the logic of Spokeo and \nTransUnion  and rested in part on its own precedent . We \ntherefore do not understand  the Fifth Circuit’s decision  to \nconflict with our own, nor are we inclined to adopt its approach. As we read Thole , TransUnion,  and Spokeo, a \nbreach of contract alone —without any actual harm —is \npurely an injury in law, not an injury in fact . And it therefore  \nfalls short of the  Articl e III requirements for  a suit in federal \ncourt . \nC.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** \n   Rex Real Estate I, L.P., a Texas-based company, filed a lawsuit against Rex Real Estate Exchange, Inc. alleging trademark infringement. The Fifth Circuit Court affirmed the district court’s decision that Rex Real Estate I, L.P. did not have standing for infringement claims on federally registered trademarks under Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act due to lack of assignment of rights, but reversed and remanded the case to consider claims under Section 43(a) for unregistered trademarks, where automation was relevant as the defendant uses AI to connect buyers with homes.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether Rex Real Estate Exchange, Inc.’s use of the name \"Rex\" caused consumer confusion, violating trademark protections under the Lanham Act, and whether the plaintiff had proper standing and protectable interests in the disputed trademarks.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that Rex Real Estate I, L.P. lacked standing for claims under Section 32(1) due to failure in proving an assignment of trademark rights from the original owner. However, it found potential merit in claims under Section 43(a) for unregistered trademarks and remanded the case for further proceedings, acknowledging disputes about secondary meaning and actual consumer confusion.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Two real estate companies are fighting over the right to use the name \"Rex\" in their business. One company uses smart technology to help buyers find homes, while the other has been using the name for years and thinks the new company's use of \"Rex\" confuses people. The court said the old company can't sue over the trademark because there's no proof it owns the rights, but it might have a case for confusion that happened before the trademarks were officially registered. So, the court sent part of the case back for more review.",

Cayce \nClerk Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 1     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n2 I. Background \na. Factual Background \nPlaintiff is a real estate company founded by Rex and Sherese \nGlendenning that “specializes in th e acquisition and sale of commercial, \ninvestment and development properties, both large and small, in the North \nTexas growth corridor.” Plaintiff only brokers real estate in the state of \nTexas, but it has clients throughout the United States and in other countries. \nMr. and Mrs. Glendenning first entered the Texas real estate business \nin 1987. In February 1987, Mr. Glende nning registered a sole proprietorship \ncalled “Rex Glendenning Real Estate.” Around this time, Mrs. Glendenning \nthought their last name was too long  and began answering the business’s \nphone as “Rex Real Estate .” On July 10, 1990, Mr. Glendenning registered \nanother sole proprietorship called “R ex Real Estate.” On September 16, \n1991, the Glendennings incorporated  Rex Real Estate Inc., naming \nthemselves as the two members of the Board of Directors. Finally, in \nDecember 1998, the Glendennings filed a limited partnership agreement forming Rex Real Estate I, L.P., the Plaint iff in this case. Rex Real Estate, Inc. \nwas named as a general partner with a two percent ownership interest, and \nMr. and Mrs. Glendenning were each na med as limited partners with forty-\nnine percent ownership interests.  \nPlaintiff has used three trademarks throughout its existence: “REX,” \n“REX Real Estate,” and a logo showing a crown alongside the words “REX Real Estate” (“crown mark ”). On January 13, 2015, the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office (“ USPTO ”) accepted Plaintiff’ s registration of the \ncrown mark. According to Plaintiff’s submission, the mark’s first use in \ncommerce was January 1, 1987. Plaintiff filed a federal trademark registration \nfor the “REX” mark in June 2018, clai ming its first use in commerce was \nDecember 31, 1987. Finally, it filed a federal trademark registration for the Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n3 “Rex Real Estate” mark without the cr own in June 2018, claiming its first \nuse in commerce was December 31, 1990. \nAccording to its website, Plaintiff has developed “a diverse portfolio \nof retail, office, industrial and mixed-used properties throughout Texas, [and] REX Real Estate and founder Rex Glendenning have closed hundreds of millions of dollars in investment transactions for private and institutional investors.” Plaintiff has also brokered some residential real estate. At trial, \nMrs. Glendenning identified two instances where the business sold single \nfamily homes. One of those homes was sold to the Glendennings’ daughter and son-in-law, Matthew Kiran, who is also a long-time sales agent for Plaintiff. Plaintiff’s residential listings from 2009 to 2022 include three properties identified as single-family re sidences sold to individual buyers and \nsix properties identified as residences with acreage sold to individual buyers. \nThree of these sales involved parties re lated to Plaintiff or its employees: one \nwas the sale of Mrs. Glendenning’s pare nts’ home, one was a sale to Kiran’s \nson, and the other was the aforementi oned sale to the Glendennings’ \ndaughter and Kiran. The vast majority of Plaintiff’s “residential” listings \nfrom 2009 to 2022 were investment pr operties sold to corporate entities. \nThese transactions averag ed over 238 acres and ov er $6 million per sale.  \n Defendant Rex Exchange offers an online platform for homeowners \nand homebuyers to transact the sale of si ngle-family homes. It uses artificial \nintelligence and other data-based tec hnology to match likely buyers with \nhomes. It started in 2015 in California, and it is now headquartered in Austin, \nTexas. Its business is designed to “help home buyers and sellers avoid \nexcessive costs associated with the tr aditional real estate agent-based \nmodel.” It operates in twenty-five cities in fifteen states, and it first expanded \ninto Austin in 2018. Defendant’s hist orical average sale s price of a home in \nTexas is approximately $365,000, and th e average lot size is 0.38 acres. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n4 Defendant’s CEO, Jack Ryan, testifie d that he came up with the name \nRex Exchange in 2012 or 2013 to “mimic” the idea  of the New York Stock \nExchange but make it residential. He fi rst learned of Plaintiff along with other \ncompanies named Rex when his company’ s lawyer performed a search with \nthe USPTO  in June 2014. Defendant’s first website domain name was \nRexchange—“R” for residential real estate and “ex” for exchange. In \nSeptember 2014, Defendant purchased a “REX” trademark from a company \ncalled Azavea that had registered the mark for the following use: “computer \nsoftware for use in search and displaying  real estate information on a global \ncomputer network.” Azavea’s ma rk was registered with the USPTO  in \n2006 with an October 31, 2002 priority date. \nIn Texas, Defendant advertised in print and radio advertisements \nunder the name “Rex.” It promoted its expansion into Dallas using the \nnames “Rex” and “REX Real Estate,” an d it has used a logo with the words \n“REX Real Estate” on its website and promotional materials. \nb. Procedural Background \nPlaintiff sued Defendant for tr ademark infringement, trademark \ndilution, and unfair compet ition under federal and state law. After engaging \nin discovery, the parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The magistrate \njudge issued a report recommending that the district court deny both \nmotions. The magistrate judge noted there were still genuine disputes of material fact as to: (1) whether Plai ntiff’s marks have acquired secondary \nmeaning, (2) whether consumer confus ion was probable, and (3) whether \nDefendant holds priority of use throug h the Rex mark it acquired from \nAzavea. Both parties filed objections, bu t the district court adopted the report \nin full. \nThe jury trial commenced on April 8,  2022. At trial, Plaintiff only \npressed its trademark infringement claims. It called seven witnesses: (1) Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n5 Sherese Glendenning; (2) Matthew Kiran; (3) Jack Ryan; (4) Robert \nCheetham (by deposition); (5) Danielle  Gervasi; (6) Rex Glendenning; and \n(7) Jeffery Stec. The district court admitted 521 exhibits into evidence. \nWhen Plaintiff rested its case on April 12, 2022, Defendant orally \nmoved for judgment as a matte r of law. Defendant argued that Plaintiff failed \nto meet its burden in three ways: (1) proof of legally protectable trademark \nrights; (2) proof of a like lihood of confusion caused by Defendant’s use of its \n“Rex” trademarks; and (3) proof of actual damages attributable to the alleged \ninfringement of Plaintiff’s marks.  \nThe following day, the district court orally granted Defendant’s Rule \n50 motion. The court then asked for su pplemental briefing on the motion it \nhad granted. After Plai ntiff and Defendant submitted their supplemental \nbriefs, the district court issued a wri tten order granting the motion on May \n18, 2022. It later entered final judgment in favor of Defendant, and Plaintiff \ntimely appealed. Plaintiff only appeals the judgment against its federal infringement claims under the Lanham Act. \nII. Standard of Review \nWe review de novo  a district court’s grant of judgment as a matter of \nlaw, applying the same legal standard it used. Foreman v. Babcock & Wilcox \nCo., 117 F.3d 800, 804 (5th Cir. 1997). Judgment as a matter of law is proper \nwhen “there is no legally sufficient ev identiary basis for a reasonable jury to \nhave found for that party wi th respect to that issue.” Fed. R. Civ. P.  50(a). \nIn evaluating the district court’s gr ant of judgment as a matter of law, we \n“consider all of the evidence (and not just that evidence  which supports the \nnon-mover’s case) in the light most fa vorable to the non-movant, drawing all \nfactual inferences in favor of the non- moving party, and leaving credibility \ndeterminations, the weighing of the ev idence, and the drawing of legitimate \ninferences from the facts to the jury.” Foreman , 117 F.3d at 804. “A mere Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n6 scintilla of evidence is insufficient to  present a question for the jury.” Id. \n(citation omitted). We can affirm the di strict court if the result is correct, \n“even if our affirmance is upon grou nds not relied upon by the district \ncourt.” Id. \nIII. Discussion \n Plaintiff alleges trademark infringement in violation of Sections 32(1) \nand 43(a) of the Lanham Act, which are codified as 15 U. S.C. § 1114(1) and \n15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), respectively. Sect ion 32(1) creates a cause of action for \ninfringement of registered marks; Sectio n 43(a) creates a cause of action for \ninfringement of unregistered marks. Amazing Spaces, Inc. v. Metro Mini \nStorage , 608 F.3d 225, 236 n.8 (5th Cir.  2010) (“The Lanha m Act provides \nseparate causes of action for infringement of a registered mark and an unregistered mark.”). The same two elements apply to  both causes of action. \nId. To prevail on its claims, Plaintiff must show (1) it possesses a legally \nprotectable trademark and (2) Defendan t’s use of this trademark “creates a \nlikelihood of confusion as to sour ce, affiliation, or sponsorship.” Streamline \nProd. Sys., Inc. v. Streamline Mfg., Inc. , 851 F.3d 440, 450 (5th Cir. 2017) \n(citation omitted). Before addressing these two prongs, we begin with a \nthreshold element: statutory standing.  \na. Statutory Standing \nDefendant first argues we should a ffirm the district court’s judgment \nbecause Plaintiff has failed to show that  it owns the marks. Whether a plaintiff \nhas a sufficient interest in a mark to sue under the Lanham Act is a question \nof statutory standing. “Unlike Article III standing, statutory standing is not \njurisdictional.\n Instead, it asks the merits qu estion of whether or not a \nparticular cause of action authoriz es an injured plaintiff to sue.” Simmons v. \nUBS Fin. Servs., Inc. , 972 F.3d 664, 666 (5th Cir. 2020) (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted). We apply the same standard of re view to statutory Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n7 standing as we do to the elements of the cause of action. HCB Fin. Corp. v. \nMcPherson , 8 F.4th 335, 339 (5th Cir. 2021).  \nA claimant has “statutory  standing” if its clai m “fall[s] within the \nzone of interests protected by” the statute. Allen v. Wright , 468 U.S. 737, 751 \n(1984). Section 32(1) protects register ed trademarks and pr ovides a cause of \naction against any person who “use[s] in commerce any . . . imitation of a \nregistered mark . . . likely to cause co nfusion, or to cause mistake, or to \ndeceive.” 15 U.S.C. § 1114(1). This caus e of action is only  available to the \n“registrant” of the trademark at issue, but “registrant” is defined to include \nthe original registrant’s “legal repr esentatives, predecessors, successors and \nassigns.” Id. § 1127. Under the La nham Act, the owner is  the only proper \nparty to apply for regi stration of a mark. Id. § 1051(a)(1) (“The owner of a \ntrademark used in commerce may reques t registration of its trademark.”). \nTherefore, only an owner or a true a ssignee has statutory standing to bring a \nclaim under section 32(1). Neutron Depot, L.L.C. v. Bankrate, Inc. , 798 F. \nApp’x 803, 806 (5th Cir. 2020)1; accord  Fed. Treasury Enter. Sojuzplodoimport \nv. SPI Spirits Ltd. , 726 F.3d 62, 72 (2d Cir. 2013).  \nOn the other hand, Section 43(a) pr otects unregistered trademarks \nand provides a cause of action to “any person who believes that he or she is \nlikely to be damaged by such [infringing] act.” Id. § 1125(a)(1).2 Thus, \n_____________________ \n1 Although an unpublished opin ion issued on or after January 1, 1996 is generally \nnot precedential, it may be considered as persuasive authority. Ballard v. Burton , 444 F.3d \n391, 401 & n.7 (5th Cir. 2006). \n2 The Supreme Court has cautioned that not just any person can sue under Section \n43(a). In a case that involved a false advertising claim under Section 43(a)(1)(B) [15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(B)], the Court held that a plaint iff must show the following to establish \nstatutory standing: (1) it is wi thin the “zone of interest” prot ected by the statute; and (2) \nproximate causation between its injury and the alleged statutory violation. Lexmark Int’l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc. , 572 U.S. 118, 131–33 (2014) . Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n8 Section 43(a) does not require a plaintiff to establish ownership of a \ntrademark as an element of its cause of action. Belmora L.L.C. v. Bayer \nConsumer Care AG , 819 F.3d 697, 706 (4th Cir. 2016) (“Significantly, the \nplain language of § 43(a) does not require that a plaintiff possess or have used a trademark in U.S. co mmerce as an element of the cause of action.”). \nAccordingly, Defendant’s challenge to Plaintiff’s ownership applies only to \nPlaintiff’s infringement claim under Section 32(1).  \n“Rights in a trademark are determined  by the date of the mark’s first \nuse in commerce. The party who first uses  a mark in commerce is said to have \npriority over other users.” Hana Fin., Inc. v. Hana Bank , 574 U.S. 418, 419 \n(2015); Blue Bell, Inc. v. Farah Mfg. Co., Inc. , 508 F.2d 1260, 1264–65 (5th \nCir. 1975) (“Ownership of a mark ‘requires a combination of both appropriation and use in trade.’”). Pl aintiff argues that “the Glendennings \nhave wholly controlled use of the marks from the start—first as sole proprietors, then as sole directors of Rex Real Estate, Inc., and now as 49 \npercent owners each of the limited pa rtnership (with the other 2 percent \nowned by the corporation).” But acco rding to the evidence submitted by \nPlaintiff, Rex Glendenning first used  the three marks in commerce between \n1987 and 1990 as a sole proprietor. Unde r Texas law, a sole proprietorship is \none and the same as the per son who is the proprietor. Ideal Lease Serv., Inc. \nv. Amoco Prod. Co. , 662 S.W.2d 951, 952 (Tex. 1983). Thus, Mr. Glendenning \nbecame the original owner of the mark s when he first used them in commerce \nmany years before Plaintiff was formed. \nPlaintiff claims the Lanham Act permitted it to register the marks \nbecause “an applicant seeking to regist er a trademark may benefit from its \nuse by a related company.” 15 U.S.C. § 1055. A “related company” is defined as “any person whose use of a mark is controlled by the owner of the \nmark with respect to the na ture and quality of the good s or services on or in \nconnection with which the mark is used.” Id. § 1127. The term “person” Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 8     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n9 includes juristic persons and natural persons. Id. While the owner who \nregisters the mark may benefit from the mark’s use by related companies, this does not displace the requirement that only the owner can seek registration. \nId. § 1051(a)(1).  \nUnder the Lanham Act, assignments of marks that have already been \nfederally registered mu st be in writing. Id. § 1060 (“Assignments shall be by \ninstruments in writing duly executed .”). Defendant relies on a Second \nCircuit case to argue that the assignment here must have been in writing, but \nthat case is inapposite because it in volved the transfer of a mark that was \nalready federally registered. SPI Spirits , 726 F.3d at 67. On the other hand, \nPlaintiff argues that no assignment was needed because the marks were not \npreviously federally register ed. In support, it cites Diebold for the proposition \nthat “[i]t is well settled that an assignment in writing is not necessary to pass rights in a trademark.” Diebold, Inc. v. Multra-Guard, Inc. , 189 U.S.P.Q. 119, \n1975 WL 20913, *6 (T.T.A.B. Oct. 2,  1975). However, the Trademark Trial \nand Appeal Board went on to say that “[t]he acquisition of such rights may \nbe established by oral testimony and if such oral testimony is clear and \nuncontradictory testimony it may be accepted to prove the assignment.” Id. \nWhile assignment by writing is not necessary to transfer ownership of a \ntrademark under common law, an  assignment is still necessary. Id.; 3 J. \nThomas McCarthy , McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair \nCompetition  § 18:4 (5th ed. 2022) (“An assignment in writing is not \nnecessary to pass common law rights in  a trademark.”). As our sister Circuit \nhas explained, “[r]equiring strong ev idence to establish an assignment is \nappropriate both to prevent parties from  using self-serving testimony to gain \nownership of trademarks and to give part ies incentives to identify expressly \nthe ownership of the marks they employ.” TMT N. Am., Inc. v. Magic Touch \nGmbH , 124 F.3d 876, 884 (7th Cir. 1997). Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 9     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n10 At trial, Plaintiff failed to produc e any evidence that Mr. Glendenning \nassigned his rights in the marks to Pl aintiff. In one exchange, Defendant’s \ncounsel asked Mrs. Glendenning, “There ’s never been a time when you and \nyour husband transferred any individual rights you might have had to any trademark to the limited partnership, correct?” to which she responded, “I \ndon’t understand that question.” Af ter some clarification, Defendant’s \ncounsel asked the question again, and Mrs. Glendenning responded, “I \napologize, but I truly do not unders tand the question. Rex and I own the \ntrademarks and Rex Real Estate I is ou r limited partnership.” There was no \nother testimony regarding the assignment of the marks at trial.  \nNo reasonable jury could conclude that these statements amount to \nclear and uncontradictory testimony that Rex Glendenning assigned his \nrights in the marks to Plaintiff. Accord ingly, we affirm the district court’s \njudgment as a matter of law as to Plai ntiff’s Section 32(1) claim for any \nalleged infringement of th e marks after they were  federally registered. \nForeman , 117 F.3d at 804 (Our affirmance  can be upon grounds not relied \nupon by the district court). However, Defendant’s ownership challenge does not apply to Plaintiff’s claim under Section 43(a) for infringement of any \nmarks before they were federally re gistered. We proceed to analyze the \njudgment as to that claim.   \nb. Protectable Marks  \n For the first prong of its claim, Pl aintiff must show that the marks are \nlegally protectable. Streamline , 851 F.3d at 450. Plaintiff makes three \narguments to that effect: (1) the crown logo is incontestable; (2) each of the \nthree marks are inherently distinctive;  and (3) each of the three marks have \ndeveloped secondary meaning. Since we  find a reasonable jury could \nconclude that the marks are inherently distinctive, we pretermit addressing \nthe other two arguments. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 10     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n11 Based on the evidence su bmitted, the district court concluded that no \nreasonable jury could find that the ma rks are anything other than personal \nname marks. Plaintiff claims this was erro r and that its three marks are at least \nsuggestive because it presented evidence that the marks refer not merely to Rex Glendenning but also to the Lati n translation of “rex” as “king.” \nMarks are classified along a spec trum in order of increasing \ndistinctiveness: (1) generic; (2) descript ive; (3) suggestive; (4) arbitrary; or \n(5) fanciful. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc. , 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1992). \nWord marks that are suggestive, arbi trary, or fanciful are inherently \ndistinctive. Wal–Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Bros., Inc. , 529 U.S. 205, 210–11, \n(2000). A generic term refers to the class of which a good is a member. Xtreme Lashes, L.L.C. v. Xtended Beauty, Inc. , 576 F.3d 221, 227 (5th Cir. \n2009). A descriptive term provides an attribute or quality of a good. Id. A \nsuggestive term suggests, but does not describe, an attribute of the good; it \nrequires the consumer to exercise his or her imagination to apply the \ntrademark to the good. Id. This court prefers to “hav[e] a jury decide the \nissue of the categorization of a mark.” Streamline , 851 F.3d at 453. Although \njudgment as a matter of law “is rarely ap propriate” on the factual question \nof categorization, Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 232, we may affirm such a \njudgment where the record compels it. Amazing Spaces , 608 F.3d at 234. \nUnder the Lanham Act, a mark that is “primarily merely a surname” \nis not registerable in the absence of secondary meaning. 15 U.S.C. § 1052(e)(4). We also join our sister circuits in recognizing that “[f]or the purpose of trademark analysis, personal names—both surnames and first names—are generally regarded  as descriptive terms which require \nproof of secondary meaning.” 815 Tonawanda St. Corp . v. Fay’s Drug Co. , 842 \nF.2d 643, 648 (2d Cir. 1988); Perini Corp. v. Perini Const., Inc. , 915 F.2d 121, \n125 (4th Cir. 1990); Tana v. Dantanna’s , 611 F.3d 767, 774 (11th Cir. 2010); \nQuiksilver, Inc. v. Kymsta Corp. , 466 F.3d 749, 760 (9th Cir. 2006). A mark Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 11     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n12 can still be inherently distinctive if the public perceives the mark to be \nsomething other than a personal name. 2 J. Thomas McCarthy,  \nMcCarthy on Trademarks & Unfair Competition  § 13:2 (5th \ned. 2022) (“even if a mark  actually consists of an actual personal name, \nsecondary meaning will be required only  if the public perceives the mark to \nbe a personal name.”). However, “the mer e fact that a word has a dictionary \ndefinition does not exclude the possi bility that it is primarily merely a \nsurname.” Lane Cap. Mgmt., Inc. v.  Lane Cap. Mgmt., Inc. , 192 F.3d 337, 346 \n(2d Cir. 1999). The relevant question  is whether the purchasing public \nperceives the mark as a whole as prim arily referring to a personal name. Id.  \nIn concluding that the marks are nothing more than  personal name \nmarks, the district court relied on Mr. Glendenning’s affidavit that Plaintiff \nsubmitted to the USPTO  when it sought to cancel Defendant’s trademarks. \nIn his declaration, he st ated that “[a]mong consu mers in the real estate \nindustry, the name ‘REX’ has beco me synonymous with REX and Rex \nGlendenning as the exclusive source of the REX Real Estate Services, with \nRex Glendenning as an individual bein g uniquely identified and recognized \nby consumers both in Te xas and nationally as th e founder of REX and REX \nReal Estate Services.” At trial, Mr. Glendenning confirmed the statements \nmade in his declaration. But Mr. Glende nning also stated, “I believe in my \ndeposition, I also stated that we also named -- put the crown over Rex because \nof the Latin meaning of king and -- bu t yes I don’t deny that my name’s Rex \nand that it means king in Latin an d we adopted it as -- the name of our \ncompany.” At this point, Defendant’s counsel had Mr. Glendenning turn to \na page in his deposition where th e following exchange occurred:  \nQ. (BY MR. FLYNN) And I’ll -- when you made the decision \nto adopt the name Rex Real Es tate, why did you make that \ndecision?  Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 12     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n13 A. Because I’m Rex, and I’m in the real estate business. And \nit’s my mark and we think it’s an excellent one and we decided \nto run with it the last th ree decades. The real Rex. \nDefendant’s counsel then asked, “When you made th e decision to adopt the \nname Rex Real Estate, you did it becaus e you’re Rex and yo u are in the real \nestate business, correct?” to which Mr. Glendenning responded, “That’s \nwhat it says.” However, there was other evidence at trial supporting Plaintiff’s claim that the public perc eives the marks by their Latin meaning. \nFor instance, Mrs. Glendenning testified that she “came up with the crown because Rex means king and that was th at.” Plaintiff’s counsel also had Mr. \nRyan, Defendant’s CEO, read a portion of Defendant’s response to an interrogatory where it said: “Defenda nt uses its mark Rex alone while \nplaintiff’s mark is Rex Real Estate . Defendant’s mark is most often \naccompanied by a crown, reinforcing the translation of Rex as a king in \nLatin.” Ryan confirmed this statement and clarified that the reference to \nDefendant is a typo because Plaintiff’s mark is most often accompanied by a \ncrown.  \nPlaintiff argues that the district  court erred by relying on Mr. \nGlendenning’s affidavit because it looked  only to what the company intended \nfor the mark, not how consumers perceive it. But Mr. Glendenning’s declaration does not merely speak for himself or the company—he claimed \nthat the name Rex has become synonymous  with him as a person and founder \nof the company to consumers in the real estate industry. Plaintiff did not submit any evidence showing that the relevant consuming public associates \nthe Rex marks with their purported  Latin meaning. Nevertheless, it \nsubmitted evidence that Defendant views its marks by their Latin translation. \nWhile Defendant is not necessarily a member of the “purchasing public,” \nthe fact that some party outside of Plai ntiff recognizes the Latin translation \nsupport its claims that the marks could be inherently distinctive. While there Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 13     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n14 was strong evidence that the marks are perceived by the public as primarily a \npersonal name, the record does  not compel that conclusion. Amazing Spaces , \n608 F.3d at 234. The district court e rred by deciding as a matter of law that \nPlaintiff’s marks are not inherently distinctive. \nc. Likelihood of Confusion  \nThe second prong—“likelihood of co nfusion”—requires Plaintiff to \nshow that Defendants’ us e of the “Rex” marks “create[d] a likelihood of \nconfusion in the minds of potential cons umers as to the source, affiliation, or \nsponsorship.” Springboards To Educ., Inc. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist. , 912 \nF.3d 805, 811-12 (5th Cir. 2019) (quoting Elvis Presley Enters., Inc. v. Capece , \n141 F.3d 188, 193 (5th Cir. 1998)). To evaluate whether there is a likelihood of \nconfusion, we use a non-exhaustive lis t of factors known as the “digits of \nconfusion.” Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 227. The digi ts are: “(1) the type of \ntrademark; (2) mark similarity; (3) product similarity; (4) outlet and \npurchaser identity; (5) advertising media  identity; (6) defendant’s intent; (7) \nactual confusion; and (8) care ex ercised by potential purchasers.” Id. “No \ndigit is dispositive, and the digits may weigh differently from case to case, ‘depending on the particular facts and circumstances involved.’” Id. \n(citation omitted). “In addition to th e digits of confusion, the particular \ncontext in which the mark appear s must receive special emphasis.” Scott \nFetzer Co. v. House of Vacuums Inc. , 381 F.3d 477, 485-8 6 (5th Cir. 2004). \n“While likelihood of confusion is ty pically a question of fact, summary \njudgment is proper if the ‘record compel s the conclusion th at the movant is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 227 \n(citation omitted); see also  Springboards , 912 F.3d at 818 (affirming grant of \nsummary judgment because “the great weight of the digits suggests there is no likelihood of confusion.”); Perry v. H. J. Heinz Co. Brands, L.L.C. , 994 \nF.3d 466, 473 (5th Cir. 2021) (affi rming grant of summary judgment on \nlikelihood of confusion). We address each digit in turn. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 14     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n15 i. The type of trademark. \n“‘Type of trademark’ refers to the strength of the senior mark.” \nXtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 227. “We analyze two factors in determining the \nstrength of a mark: (1) the mark’s position along the distinctiveness \nspectrum, and (2) ‘the standing of  the mark in the marketplace.’” \nSpringboards , 912 F.3d at 814 (citation omitted). The first factor refers to the \nfive categories of increasing distinct iveness that marks generally fall into. \nXtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 227. As discussed above, Plaintiff has presented \nsufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the marks are at least suggestive.  \nThe second factor is “the standing  of the mark in the marketplace.” \nSpringboards , 912 F.3d at 814 (internal quotat ion marks and citation omitted). \nHere, the district court found that th e marks had low standing because many \nother entities in Texas have “Rex” names, and some of those businesses are \ninvolved in real estate. Plaintiff cha llenges the district court’s reliance on \nthird-party usage in other industries, bu t “[a]ll third-party use of a mark, not \njust use in the same indus try as a plaintiff, may be relevant to whether a \nplaintiff’s mark is strong or weak.” Bd. of Supervisors for La. State Univ. Agric. \n& Mech. Coll. v. Smack Apparel Co. , 550 F.3d 465, 479 (5th Cir. 2008). Still, \nthird-party usage is especially relevant  when it falls within the same industry \nor category of services. Springboards , 912 F.3d at 815 (numerous third-party \nliteracy programs using language simila r or nearly identical to plaintiff’s \nmarks “suggests that consumers will not associate the junior mark’s use with \nthe senior mark user”); Sun Banks of Fla., Inc. v. Sun Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n , \n651 F.2d 311, 316 (5th Cir. 1981) (A significant number of other Florida financial institutions using “Sun” in their names lessened the standing of the \nmark). “[T]he key is whether the thir d-party use diminishes in the public’s \nmind the association of the mark with the plaintiff.” Smack Apparel , 550 F.3d \nat 479. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 15     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n16 Defendant claims there are hundreds of entities using “Rex” in their \nbusiness name, including in real estate. It follows this assertion with ranges of citations to over 1000 pages in the re cord on appeal, and it does not specify \nwhich pages in these ranges show other “Rex” entities involved in Texas real \nestate. We have noted that “it is not the function of the Court of Appeals to \ncomb the record for possible error, but ra ther it is counsel’s responsibility to \npoint out distinctly and specifically th e precise matters complained of, with \nappropriate citations to the page or pages in the record where the matters \nappear.” United States v. Martinez-Mercado , 888 F.2d 1484, 1492 (5th Cir. \n1989). The same goes for the Appellee—we will not go on a fishing expedition in search of evidence to  support Defendant’s argument. While \nthere are many other entities named “Rex” in Texas, Defendant has not \nsatisfactorily pointed us to evidence of other Texas businesses using the term “Rex” in real estate. Furthermore, the jury saw proof that only Plaintiff and \nDefendant appear in the first page of resu lts in a Google search for “Rex Real \nEstate Texas.”  Plaintiff also asserts th at the numerous calls it received from \nconfused consumers who heard Defend ant’s advertisements shows that the \nmarks have strong standing  in the marketplace because it could mean that the \ncallers assumed that Plaintiff was the sol e source of the advertising. This is a \nplausible inference for a jury to make. Taken together and in the light most \nfavorable to the Plaintiff, a reasonable ju ry could find that this factor weighs \nin favor of Plaintiff.  \nii. Mark similarity . \nThe degree of similarity between ma rks “is determined by comparing \nthe marks’ appearance , sound, and meaning.” Elvis Presley Enters. , 141 F.3d \nat 201. “Similarity of appearance is dete rmined on the basis of the total effect \nof the designation, rather than on a comparison of individual features,” but \n“courts should give more attention to  the dominant features of a mark.” Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 16     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n17 Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 228 (internal qu otation marks and citations \nomitted). \nThe district court concluded that the crown logo and one of \nDefendant’s logos are visually distinct because they use different fonts, colors, and design elements. However,  these two logos contain the same \nwords, “Rex Real Estate,” in a similar configuration. Plaintiff also submitted \nevidence that Defendant has advertised itself as “Rex Real Estate” and \n“Rex.” A reasonable jury could find these marks si milar enough to confuse \ntheir origin. Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 228.  \niii & iv.  Product similarity and identity of purchasers . \n“The greater the similarity betwee n the products and services, the \ngreater the likelihood of confusion.” Exxon Corp. v. Texas Motor Exch. of \nHouston, Inc. , 628 F.2d 500, 505 (5th Cir. 19 80). Likewise, “[d]issimilarities \nbetween the retail outlets for and the predominant consumers of plaintiff’s \nand defendants’ goods lessen the possi bility of confusion, mistake, or \ndeception.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).  “When products or \nservices are noncompeting, the confus ion at issue is one of sponsorship, \naffiliation, or connection.” Elvis Presley Enters. , 141 F.3d at 202. “The danger \nof affiliation or sponsorship confusio n increases when the junior user’s \nservices are in a market that is one in to which the senior user would naturally \nexpand . . . The actual intent of the seni or user to expand is not particularly \nprobative of whether the junior user’s market is one into which the senior \nuser would naturally expand . . . Co nsumer perception is the controlling \nfactor.” Id. “If consumers believe, even thou gh falsely, that the natural \ntendency of producers of the type of good s marketed by the prior user is to \nexpand into the market for the type of goods marketed by  the subsequent \nuser, confusion may be likely.” Id. (citation omitted). Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 17     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n24 trying to reach the defendant. Id. at 1160. There, we distinguished Domino’s \nPizza  and Sun Banks  because the evidence of actu al confusion was “thin” in \nthose cases. Id. Citing an Eleventh Circuit case analyzing Fifth Circuit case \nlaw, we explained that our “precedents give varying weight  to evidence of \nactual confusion, depending on whet her it is short-lived confusion by \nindividuals casually acquainted with a bu siness or lasting confusion by actual \ncustomers.” Id. at n.11 (citing Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Safeway Discount Drugs , \n675 F.2d 1160, 1166–1167 (11th Cir. 1982)). The two companies provided \ndifferent products to different customer s, so there was no possibility that the \nmisdirected phone calls could divert  sales away from the plaintiff. \nNevertheless, we credited this evidence  in affirming the lower court’s finding \nof likelihood of confusion on clear error review. Id. at 1160.  \nIn Elvis Presley Enterprises, we held that  “[i]nfringement can be based \nupon confusion that creates initial consu mer interest, even though no actual \nsale is finally completed as  a result of the confusion.” Elvis Presley Enterprises, \nInc. v. Capece , 141 F.3d 188, 204 (5th Cir. 1998) (citing 3 J. Thomas \nMcCarthy , McCarthy On Trademarks and Unfair \nCompetition  § 23:6 (4th ed. 1997)). Initial confusion, even if it is “later \ndissipated by further inspection of the goods, services, or premises . . . is \nrelevant to a determination of a likelihood of confusion.” Id. (citations \nomitted). Such confusion “gives the ju nior user credibility during the early \nstages of a transaction and can possibly bar the senior user from consideration \nby the consumer once the confusion is dissipated.” Id. In that case, Elvis \nPresley Enterprises (“ EPE ”), the assignee and regist rant of all trademarks, \ncopyrights, and publicity rights belonging to the Elvis Presle y estate, sued the \nowner of a Houston bar ca lled “the Velvet Elvis.” Id. at 191. EPE presented \nthe testimony of various witnesses wh o “initially thought the Defendants’ \nbar was a place that was associated with Elvis Presley and that it might have \nElvis merchandise for sale.” Id. at 204. After entering , each witness had no Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 24     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n25 doubt the bar was not affiliated with Elvis in any way. Id. Concluding that this \nkind of initial interest confusion was still relevant, we observed the following: \nDespite the confusion being dissi pated, this initial-interest \nconfusion is beneficial to the Defendants because it brings patrons in the door; indeed, it brought at least one of EPE’s \nwitnesses into the bar. Once in the door, the confusion has \nsucceeded because some patrons may stay, despite realizing \nthat the bar has no relationship with EPE. This initial-interest \nconfusion is even more significant because the Defendants’ bar sometimes charges a cover charge for entry, which allows the Defendants to benefit from initial-interest confusion before it can be dissipated by entry into the bar. \nId. at 204. Unlike Sun Banks , these instances involved potential customers of \nplaintiff because they were interested in official Elvis merchandise, but they \nwalked in defendant’s door because they  were confused as to affiliation.  \nWith these decisions to guide our anal ysis, we turn to the evidence in \nthis case. Plaintiff points to two in stances of people who inadvertently \ncontacted Defendant while looking to do  business with or contact Plaintiff. \nOn September 13, 2018, one person sent  Defendant a chat message on their \nwebsite stating, “I need REX Glen denning email or phone number.” \nDefendant’s chat agent responded, “W e currently don’t have anyone with \nthat name at this company.” On June 14, 2019, another person sent a chat \nmessage inquiring about a property stat i n g ,  “ Y o u  h a v e  y o u r  s i g n s  u p  i n  \nProsper and areas around there for larg e parcels of land,” but the chat agent \nresponded, “Sorry, we do not sell land and we are not in the Dallas area.” In \nboth of those cases, people intending to contact Plaintiff inadvertently contacted Defendant. In each case, the person inquiring clearly intended to \ncontact or transact business with Plaint iff. Thus, unlike the initial interest \nconfusion in Elvis Presley , this confusion did not present the possibility of \ngarnering the Defendant business befor e or after it was dissipated.  Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 25     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n26  Plaintiff next points to three instances where it received phone calls \nfrom people who had seen or heard Defendant’s advertisements. It also \npresents one instance where a customer of Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff \ncomplaining about Defendant’s servic es. The district court disregarded \nthese instances because none involved  people who were seeking to do \nbusiness with Plaint iff. However, under Armco , proof that the plaintiff is \nreceiving calls from people who are trying  to do business with the other party \ncan still be relevant even where there is no realistic possibility that business \ncan be diverted. 693 F.2d at 1160. Finally, Plaintiff presents two instances of \nthird parties confusing the companies or their locations. As we have explained, those anecdotes are relevant  because proof of actual confusion is \nnot limited to actual or potential customers. Fuji, 754 F.2d at 597.  \n Plaintiff’s anecdotal proof of co nfusion does not involve swayed \ncustomer purchases or initial interest confusion that can result in swayed \nbusiness. It also does not involve “pot ential customer[s] considering whether \nto transact business with one or the other of the parties.” Sun Banks , 651 F.2d \nat 319. But it has presented instances of potential customers of each respective company mistaken ly contacting the other. Armco , 693 F.2d at \n1160. These instances are re levant, but their weight is  lessened by Plaintiff’s \nand Defendant’s high volume of bu siness and extensive advertising. Sun \nBanks , 651 F.2d at 319. Nevertheless, because Plaintiff has presented some \nrelevant evidence of actual confusion, a reasonable jury could conclude that \nthis digit weighs in its favor.  \nviii.  Degree of care exercised by potential purchasers . \n For the final digit, we determine th e degree of care by looking to both \nthe kind of goods or services offere d and the kind of purchasers. “Where \nitems are relatively inexpensive, a buye r may take less care in selecting the \nitem, thereby increasing the risk of conf usion . . . However, a high price tag Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 26     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n27 alone does not negate other [digits of co nfusion], especially if the goods or \nmarks are similar.”  Streamline , 851 F.3d at 458 (inter nal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted). “[P]rofessional an d institutional” purchasers “are \nvirtually certain to be informed, deliberative buyers.” Oreck Corp. v. U.S. \nFloor Sys., Inc. , 803 F.2d 166, 173 (5th Cir. 1986).  \nPlaintiff relies on the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board’s conclusion \nthat “average homeowners do not use a hi gh degree of care in selecting their \nbroker.” Real Est. One, Inc. v. Real Est. 100 Enterprises Corp. , 212 U.S.P.Q. \n9 5 7 ,  1 9 8 1  W L  4 0 4 7 8 ,  a t  * 3  ( T . T . A . B .  1 9 8 1 ) .  T h a t  c a s e  i n v o l v e d  t w o  r e a l  estate brokerage companies that were “primarily directed to residential \nlistings and sales.” Id. Even if Defendant’s cust omers do not use a high \ndegree of care in selecting their brok er for single-family homes, Plaintiff’s \ncustomers are not average homebuyers  or homeowners—they are by and \nlarge corporate entities and wealthy in dividuals investing in commercial and \nresidential real estate. Such customers are “virtually certain to be informed, \ndeliberative buyers.” Oreck , 803 F.2d at 173; accord  Int’l Council of Shopping \nCenters, Inc. v. RECONCRE, L.L.C. , 2021 WL 148387, at *5 (D.D.C. Jan. 14, \n2021) (“it is hard to deny that commerci al real estate market participants are, \nby and large, sophisticated consumer s.”). Plaintiff’s potential customers \nexercise a high degree of care, so no reas onable jury could find that this digit \nweighs in favor of Plaintiff.  \nix. Weighing the Digits \n Since a reasonable jury could conclude that some of these factors, \nincluding the important factor of actual confusion, weigh in Plaintiff’s favor, \na reasonable jury could also find a “probability of confusion” between \nPlaintiff and Defendant’s marks. Xtreme Lashes , 576 F.3d at 226. The district \ncourt erred by holding that Plainti ff could not establish a likelihood of \nconfusion as a matter of law. Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 27     Date Filed: 09/06/2023No. 22-50405 \n28 d. Damages  \n Plaintiff also challenges the dist rict court’s holding on damages for \ncorrective advertising and reasonable royalties. Si nce we remand for a new \ntrial, we need not address those issues.  \nIV. Conclusion \n No reasonable jury could conclude that Plaintiff owned the marks, so \nwe affirm the district court’s judgmen t as a matter of law as to Plaintiff’s \nSection 32(1) claim for alleged infr ingement of the marks after federal \nregistration. However, taking the evid ence in the light most favorable to \nPlaintiff and “leaving credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate in ferences from the facts to the jury,” \na reasonable jury could find in favor of Plaintiff’s claim under Section 43(a) \nfor infringement of the marks before they were federally registered. We AFFIRM  in part, REVERSE  in part, and REMAND  for further \nproceedings.  Case: 22-50405      Document: 75-1     Page: 28     Date Filed: 09/06/2023",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a consolidated class action lawsuit against Intrusion Inc. for alleged securities violations related to their cybersecurity product \"Intrusion Shield,\" which was claimed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to boost its stock price artificially. The parties reached a settlement of $3.25 million after accusations that the product did not perform as promised and the company's claims were misleading. The court approved the settlement agreement, certifying the class and awarding attorney's fees and expenses.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Intrusion Inc. made false representations about its product, Intrusion Shield, to artificially inflate its stock price, thereby violating securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, specifically Sections 10(b) and 20(a).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the settlement agreement as fair, reasonable, and adequate for class members, granted class certification, and awarded attorney's fees and expenses. The court found that the proposed settlement and allocation plan were proper and there was no evidence of fraud or collusion.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company says it has made a fantastic new product that uses a bit of magic and advanced technology to stop online bad guys better than ever before. This news makes the company's shares really expensive. But it turns out, the product doesn't work like they said, and the shares’ price crashes. Some people who bought these shares felt tricked and took the company to court. In the end, they all decided to settle, meaning the company would pay them some money instead of continuing with a long court battle. The judge agreed this was a fair way to resolve the issue.",

Intrusion described this new product, Intrusion \nShield, as blocking cyberthreats more effectively  than existing technologies on the \nmarket because it combined state -of-of the -art artificial intelligence tools with a \nproprietary database of 2.7 billion malicious IP addresses. (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶ 46, 58).  \n \n 1 The Amended Class Action Complaint, (Dkt.  #38), names “P. Joe Head” as a \nDefendant as opposed to “T. Joe Head.” This Order references  the Defendant as T. Joe Head \nbecause that is the name used in the Unopposed Motion f or Final Approval of Class Action \nSettlement. (Dkt.  #65).   Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 2 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>3 \n  Intrusion Shield was marketed  through promotional videos  published on the \ninternet , investor calls, government  filings, and press releases. See, e.g. , (Dkt.  #38 \n¶¶ 47–48, 58, 60, 67 ). In one press release, for example, Intrusion announced that \nduring beta testing with thirteen companies  Intrusion Shield had suc cessfully \nblocked  more than 75 million cyberthreats emanating from over 800,000 unique \nmalicious entities. (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 60). In another press release,  Intrusion allegedly  \nasserted  that the product  could prevent “zero -day” attacks: in other words, attacks \nthat exploit previously unknown cybersecurity weaknesses. (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶  42, 65). \n These representations allegedly boosted Intrusion’s stock price to over $28.00 \nper share  by April 2021.  (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 125). But within a few months, Intrusion’s stock \nprice dropped to under $4.00 per share. (Dkt.  #38 ¶ 11). Bronstein alleges that the \nstock price dropped because Intrusion Shield did not perform as investors expected. \nFar from revolutionizing the  industry, it merely repackaged existing products. \n(Dkt.  #38 ¶ 2). And instead of shutting down cyberthreats, it shut down customer \ncomputer networks. (Dkt.  #38 ¶  7). Bronstein also alleges that, based on employee \nreports and third- party research, Intrusion’s representatio ns about the product were \nnot just false but knowingly false and calculated to boost Intrusion’s stock price ahead \nof a potential sale. See, e.g. , (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶ 1, 3, 8, 41, 119– 24).  \nB. The Resulting Class Action Litigation  \n Intrusion’s alleged misrepresenta tions regarding Intrusion Shield gave rise to \ntwo federal securities class actions  in this Court:  one filed in April 2021 , and the other  \nfiled in May of the same year. (Dkt.  #1, #31). After consolidating  these cases , \n(Dkt.  #31),  appoint ing Bronstein  as Lead Plaintiff, (Dkt.  #32 at 6–7), and appoint ing Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 3 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>4 \n The Rosen Law Firm, P.A.  as class counsel  (and Steckler Wayne Cochran Cherry, \nPLLC as liaison counsel),  (Dkt.  #32 at 6 –7), the Court ordered Bronstein to file an \namended complaint. (Dkt.  #37).  \n Bronstein filed the amended complaint  on February 7,  2022 , asserting t wo \ncauses of action under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 : (1) violation of Section \n10(b) against all Defendants; and (2) violation of Section 20(a) against the individual \nDefendants.  (Dkt.  #38).  The amended complaint asserted damages against Intrusion \nunder a “fraud- on-the-market” theory —seeking to hold the comp any responsible for \nartificially  boosting  its share price through alleged misstatements regarding \nIntrusion Shield . (Dkt.  #38 ¶¶  11, 125 –29); see also Halliburton Co.  v. Erica P. John \nFund, Inc. , 573  U.S. 258, 268, 134 S.Ct. 2398, 189  L. Ed. 2d 339 (2014) .   \n Class counsel diligently litigated the case, achieving a proposed class \nsettlement in June 2022.  (Dkt.  #51). Class counsel’s efforts to secure the proposed \nsettlement included an extensive pre- suit investigation, consultations with damages \nexper ts, negotiations with opposing counsel, and participation in a full- day \nmediation.  (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32).   \nC. The Proposed Class Action Settlement  \n The proposed class settlement disposes of all claims in this consolidated class \naction  for $3,250,000.00. The propo sed class settlement value represents 7.61% of the \nmaximum possible damages that could have been recovered at trial , according to \nBronstein’s damages calculations . (Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).   \n The proposed class settlement  disposes of all claims  in this consolidated class \naction  not only between Bronstein and Intrusion, but also between Intrusion and the Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 4 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>5 \n proposed class members. The proposed class includes any  person or entity  who \npurchased (or otherwise acquired)  Intrusion stock between Oct ober 14, 2020,  and \nAugust 26, 2021. (Dkt. #38 ¶ 1). Under the proposed settlement, each class member \nwould receive  a pro rata share of the settlement fund based on the number of shares \npurchased during the relevant period, accounting for both the purchase price and the \nsale price.  (Dkt.  55-1 at 7–10); (Dkt.  #65 at  24).   \n Following  the Court’s  preliminary approval of the proposed class action \nsettlement on  August 17, 2022,  (Dkt.  #56),  Bronstein diligently notified the potential \nclass members of the proposed settlement. P otential class members were notified by \nseveral  methods —including postcard notice , email notice, and a published summary \nnotice2—resulting in delivery of notices to nearly 29,000 potential class members. \n(Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). Over 1,000 potential class members responded to the notice. \nSignificantly, no class members objected to the proposed settlement.  (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 8).  \nAnd only two class members requested exclusion from th e proposed settlement. \n(Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 7). Those two requests are invalid, however, because they did not \ncomply with basic requirements for submitting a request for exclusion. (Dkt.  #72-1 \n¶ 7).    \n Bronstein now moves for final approval of the proposed  class  settlement and \nfor attorney’s fees and expenses.  (Dkt.  #65, #66).  Intrusion does not oppose these \nmotions. The Court held a settlement fairness hearing on November 30 , 2022,  to \n \n 2 These notices were delivered through a third- party administrator. The administrator \nalso maintained a webpage and toll -free line to inform class members of the settlement and \ninstruct them on submitting claims. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶¶ 5 –6). Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 5 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>6 \n evaluate the proposed settlement’s fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy to all class \nmembers. (Dkt.  #73). No class members appeared at the hearing. The November 9, \n2022,  deadline for objecting to the proposed class settlement or requesting exclusion \nfrom  it has passed. (Dkt.  #56 ¶ 37).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n The Court’s responsibilities in evaluating a class action settlement run not only \nto the named parties, but also to the unnamed class members. The Court must ensure \nthat the class members receive adequate notice of the settlement and an opportunity \nto object or request exclusion from it . FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(1);  Pettway  v. Am. Cast \nIron Pipe Co. , 576 F.2d 1157, 1219 (5th  Cir. 1978) . The Court also must ensure that \nthat the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate” to the class members under \nthe four factors  enumerated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(2) : (1) adequacy \nof the representation,  (2) fairness of the negotiations (i.e., whether  the negotiations \nwere at arm’s length), (3) adequacy of the relief , and (4) equitability of treatment to  \nclass members . The adequacy of relief factor turns on several considerations , \nincluding  the risks of proceeding to trial.3 FED. R. CIV. P. 23(e)(2)(C).  \n In addition to the nonexclusive Rule 23 factors, courts in this c ircuit  often  \nconsider the Reed  factors in evaluating the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of \na proposed class settlement: “ (1) the existence of fraud or collusion  behind t he \n \n 3 The Rule 23 factors were added by amendment in 2018. According to the Advisory \nCommittee, these factors do not “displace any factor”  sanctioned by the circuit courts. F ED. \nR. CIV. P. 23(e)(2) Advisory Committee’s Note to 2018 Amendments. Instead, they were added \nto “focus the court and the lawyers on the core concerns of procedure and substance that \nshould guide the decision whether to approve the proposal .” Id.

Motors Corp. , 703  F.2d 170, 172 (5th  Cir. 1983)  (citations omitted) ; ODonnell v. \nHarris Cty ., No. 16 -CV-1414, 2019 WL 6219933, at *9 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 21, 2019) \n(observing that “courts in this circuit often combine [the Rule 23 and Reed factors] in \nanalyzing class settlements.” ). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n The Court finds that the motion for final approval of the proposed class \nsettlement should be granted. The propos ed settlement is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate to the class members. The class members each received adequate notice of \nthe settlement and the settlement will be effectively distributed through the plan of \nallocation. The Court therefore certifies the proposed class, approves the class \nsettlement, and awards Bronstein and class counsel  the requested attorney’s fees and \nexpenses.   \nA. The Proposed Class Settlement Is Fair, Reasonable, and Adequate.  \n The proposed class settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate under both the \nRule 23 and Reed factors.  \ni. Adequacy of Class Representation  \n The record establishes that Bronstein and class  counsel adequately \nrepresented the settlement class in litigatin g this complex securities case and in \nnegotiating the proposed settlement agreement. Bronstein is an Intrusion securities Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 7 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>8 \n investor who suffered the same alleged injuries as the other class members. His \nmotivations are therefore aligned with the other class  members, reducing the \nlikelihood of a conflict of interest. In re Polaroid ERISA Litig. , 240  F.R.D. 65, 77 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2006)  (“Where plaintiffs and class members share the common goal of \nmaximizing recovery, there is no conflict of interest between the clas s representatives \nand other class members.”). Bronstein also actively participated in the case by \ncommunicating with counsel and participating in settlement negotiations , further \ndemonstrating the adequacy of his representation.  (Dkt.  #65-5 ¶¶ 3– 7).  \n Class counsel diligently prosecuted the case on behalf of the class. In addition \nto drafting pleadings and negotiating the settlement agreement, counsel also \ninvestigated the claims, retained a private investigator, consulted with damages \nexperts, drafted deta iled mediation statements, and participated in a full -day \nmediation. (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32). Counsel was competent and informed and ably \nrepresented not only Bronstein, but also the proposed class. See Hays v. Eaton Grp. \nAttorneys, LLC , No. CV 17-88-JWD -RLB, 2019 WL 427331, at *9 (M.D.  La. Feb. 4, \n2019) ( approving class settlement agreement negotiated by “a law firm with \nsubstantial experience in litigating complex class actions ”).  \nii. Arm’s Length Negotiations, Fraud, and Collusion  \n The propos ed settlement agreement is not the product of fraud or collusion; \ninstead, it arises from extensive arm’s length negotiations between sophisticated counsel. The parties entered the proposed settlement agreement after a full -day \nmediation —which  “suggests th e settlement was not the result of improper dealings.”  \nErica P. John Fund, Inc.  v. Halliburton Co. , No. 3:02 -CV-1152- M, 2018 WL 1942227, Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 8 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>9 \n at *4 (N.D.  Tex. Apr. 25, 2018).  The mediator , Jed D. Melnick,  had substantial \nexperience mediating complex securities actions, lending further support to the \nagreement’s legitimacy. See Gordon  v. Vanda Pharm. Inc. , No. 19 -CV-1108, 2022 WL \n4296092, at *4 (E.D.N.Y.  Sept. 15, 2022) (holding that mediation conducted by Jed D. \nMelnick, “a highly qualified mediator [,] strongly supports a finding that the \nnegotiations were conducted at  arm’s length without  collusion ”); In re China Med. \nCorp. Sec. Litig. , No. 8:11 -1061- JLS, 2014 WL 12581781, at *5 (C.D.  Cal. Jan.  7, 2014) \n(“Mr. Melnick ’s involvement in the settlement supports the argument that it is non -\ncollusive.”). In any event, the Court may presume the absence of any fraud or \ncollusion when, as here, no evidence has been presented to the contrary.  See Welsh  v. \nNavy Fed. Credit Union , No. 16 -CV-1062, 2018 WL 7283639, at *12 (W.D.  Tex. Aug. \n20, 2018)  (“The Court may . . . presume that no fraud or collusion occurred between \nopposing counsel in the absence of any evidence to the contrary.”) . \niii. Adequacy of Relief ; Expected Complexity, Expense, and Duration \nof the Litigation  \n The proposed settlement agreement provides adequate relief to the class. True, \nthe proposed $3,250,000.00 settlement represents only 7. 61% of the total recovery \nthat class members could have obtained at trial based on Bronstein’s damages model.  \n(Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).  But federal courts have long recognized that, when \nfaced with the expense and unpredictability of ongoing litigation, it often makes good \nsense to settle for ev en small fractions of the total amount in controversy. Ayers v. \nThompson , 358 F.3d 356, 369 (5th Cir. 2004) (observing that settling “avoids the risks \nand burdens of potentially protracted litigation”).  Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 9 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>10 \n  That is especially true when the case involves compl ex issues like those \npresented in this consolidated securities class action. Securities claims are \nparticularly  “difficult to prove ” because of the high bar for  establishing falsity an d \nscienter. Stott v. Capital Fin. Servs., Inc. , 277 F.R.D. 316, 343 (N.D . Tex. 2011); \nFishoff v. Coty Inc. , No. 09 -CV-628, 2010 WL 305358, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.  Jan. 25, 2010) \n(“[T]he element of scienter is often the most difficult and controversial aspect of a \nsecurities fraud claim.”), aff’d , 634 F.3d 647 (2d Cir. 2011). A trial w ould therefore \nlikely be “lengthy, burdensome, and  would  consume tremendous time and resources.” \nHays, 2019 WL 427331, at * 10. After the trial concluded, the losing party would likely \nappeal the judgement, causing further delay and additional expense.  \n Because any future recovery would be burdensome and unpredictable, \nBronstein opted for a settlement that is immediate and guaranteed. That settlement \nwill adequately and fairly compensate the class. This settlement is  also in line with \nother class settlement  agreements that have been approved by federal courts.4 See, \ne.g., Erica P. John Fund, Inc.  v. Halliburton Co. , No. 3:02 -CV-1152- M, 2018 WL \n1942227, at *5 (N.D.  Tex. Apr. 25, 2018)  (observing that courts frequently approve \nclass action settlements even when the settlement amount is a small fraction of what  \nclass plaintiffs could recover at trial ); City of Omaha Police & Fire Ret. Sys. v. LHC \nGrp., No. CIV. 6:12 -1609, 2015 WL 965696, at *7 (W.D. La. Mar. 3, 2015) (“The typical \nrecovery in  most class actions generally is three -to-six cents on the dollar.”).  \n \n 4 As explained below, see infra Part III(D), the proposed settlement is also adequate \nconsidering “the terms of any proposed award of attorney’s fees.” F ED. R. CIV. P. \n23(e)(2)(C)(i ii).   Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 10 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>11 \n  The proposed settlement is adequate not only in its amount  considering the \nrisks of proceeding to trial , but also in two additional ways contemplated in Rule 23’s \nadequacy factor:  \n First , the proposed settlement’s  allocation plan distributes the settlement fund \nthrough a reasonable process. Counsel has retained a third -party administrator to \nprocess the claims, assist claimants in curing deficiencies, and distribute funds on a \npro rata b asis. (Dkt.  #72-1). The Court finds that the proposed distribution process \nwill adequately deliver settlement funds to the class members.  \n Second , the proposed settlement is reasonable considering any agreements \nmade in connection with the proposed settle ment . Although Intrusion may terminate \nthe proposed settlement under a confidential agreement if enough class members \nrequest exclusion from it, (Dkt.  #50 at 14– 15), the Court finds that this agreement is \nfair under the circumstances and does not undermine  the adequacy of the proposed \nsettlement’s relief to the class. See Erica P. John F und, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 1, \n5 (approving a class settlement with a similar confidentiality provision ). The parties \nhave also filed a stipulation that publicly discloses the proposed settlement’s terms. \n(Dkt.  #55).  \niv. Equitable Distribution  \n The proposed settlement’s allocation plan equitably distributes proceeds \nbetween the class members. When an allocat ion plan is “formulated by competent \nand experienced counsel,” it will generally be upheld if it is supported by a “reasonable, rational basis.” In re IMAX Sec. Litig. , 283 F.R.D. 178, 192 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quotations omitted).  Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 11 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>12 \n  Here, the allocation plan is  supported by a reasonable basis. It was developed \nwith the assistance of a damages consultant and provides each class member a pro \nrata share of the settlement fund based on the number of shares purchased during \nthe relevant period. (Dkt.  #55-1 at 7–10); (Dkt.  #65 at  24). In calculating each class \nmember’s pro rata share of the settlement fund, the allocation plan accounts for the timing and price of each purchase, as well as the timing and price of any eventual \nsale, as is common in securities class actio ns. See, e.g. , City of Omaha Police & Fire \nRet. Sys. , 2015 WL 965693, at *15 (approving a class action allocation plan in which \neach class member would receive a pro rata share of a recognized loss); N.Y. State \nTeachers’ Ret. Sys.  v. Gen. Motors Co. , 315 F .R.D. 226, 241 (E.D.  Mich. 2016), aff’d \nsub nom. Marro  v. N.Y. State Teachers’ Ret. Sys. , No. 16 -1821, 2017 WL 6398014 \n(6th Cir. Nov. 27, 2017) (collecting cases approving similar allocation plans).  \nv. Stage of Proceedings and Discovery Efforts  \n The stage  of proceedings and discovery efforts factor also weighs in favor of \napproving the proposed settlement. In evaluating this factor, the key issue is whether the parties and court possess sufficient information to “evaluate the merits of the \ncompeting positi ons.” Ayers, 358 F.3d at 369. Even when the parties “have not \nconducted much formal discovery,” this factor can be satisfied when other information demonstrates that the settlement should be approved. Klein v. O’Neal, Inc. , \n705 F.Supp.2d 632, 65 3 (N.D. Tex. 2010); see also  Union Asset Mgmt. Holding A.G.  v. \nDell, Inc. , 669 F.3d 632, 639 (5th  Cir. 2012) (“ [F]ormal discovery is not a prerequisite \nto approving a [class] settlement as reasonable. ”). That conclusion flows naturally \nfrom the general prin ciple that early settlements should be encouraged, not hindered, Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 12 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>13 \n so long as the parties have obtained the “desired quantum of information necessary \nto achieve a settlement.” Jenkins v. Trustmark Nat’l Bank , 300 F.R.D. 291, 304 \n(S.D. Miss. 2014) (quotations  omitted).  \n Here, the parties have obtained ample information to achieve an informed \nsettlement. To begin, Bronstein’s counsel engaged in an extensive pre- suit \ninvestigation to determine the strength of the claims against Intrusion. (Dkt.  #65-2 \n¶ 32). This pre-suit investigation involved reviewing public documents, including \nSEC filings and analyst reports, and retaining a private investigator. (Dkt.  #65 \nat 15); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 32). Following the pre- suit investigation, the parties extensively \nnegotiated the proposed settlement and participated in a full -day mediation with an \nexperienced mediator, which enabled the parties to develop a “full understanding of \nthe legal and factual issues surrounding [the] case” before agreeing to the proposed \nsettlement. Manchaca  v. Chater, 927 F.Supp. 962, 967 (E.D. Tex. 1996).  \nvi. Probability of Success on the Merits  \n The proposed settlement’s fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy is further \ndemonstrated by the uncertainty of success should the case proceed to trial. When there has been no showing of fraud or collusion , the probability of success is the most \nimportant factor in evaluating a proposed settlement. Smith v. Crystian , 91 F.App’x. \n952, 955 n.3 (5th  Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (citing Parker v. Anderson , 667 F.2d 1204, \n1209 (5th  Cir. 1982)). This factor requires the court to “compare the terms of the \nsettlement wi th the rewards the class would have been likely to receive following a \nsuccessful trial.” DeHoyos  v. Allstate Corp. , 240 F.R.D. 269, 287 (W.D. Tex. 2007). But \nin comparing the settlement’s terms with the potential rewards at trial, the c ourt Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 13 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>14 \n must avoid “tr y[ing] the case in the settlement hearings.” Reed , 703 F.2d at 172. That \nwould undermine the settlement’s “very purpose,” which is to “avoid the delay and \nexpense of such a trial.”  Id. (quotations omitted ).  \n Here, the claims against Intrusion are hotly co ntested and difficult to prove. \nAgainst Bronstein’s efforts to develop these claims through extensive investigation \nand expert analysis, Intrusion has retained sophisticated counsel to oppose these \nefforts and would likely continue opposing them through tr ial and appeal. Intrusion \nwould no doubt challenge the sufficiency of Bronstein’s proof on a notoriously difficult \nelement in a securities claim: scienter. See Stott, 277 F.R.D. at 343 (noting that \nsecurities claims are “difficult to prove”).  \n Even if Bronstein established Intrusion’s liability for the alleged securities \nviolations, he would face additional challenges certifying a class and establishing \ndamages on a class -wide basis. For example,  it is likely that  Intrusion  would \nvigorously dispute the connection between  its alleged wrongdoing and the drop in its \nstock price. If Bronstein could prove that connection, Intrusion could still dispute \nwhat portion of the drop was attributable to its  actions as opposed to other causes.  \n The result would be a protracted battle of the experts that is avoided through \nthe proposed settlement. See In re Cendant Corp. Litig. , 264 F.3d 201, 236, 286 \n(3d Cir. 2001) (approving class action settlement in securities litigation in which \ncompeting positions on damages issu es would have devolved into a “battle of the \nexperts”); In re OCA, Inc. Sec. & Derivative Litig. , No. CV- 05-2165, 2009 WL 512081, \nat *14 (E.D. La. Mar. 2, 2009) (“Because the jury would have been faced with Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 14 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>15 \n competing expert opinions, the resulting damage a ward would have been highly \nunpredictable.”).  \nvii. Range and Certainty of Recovery \n The range and certainty of recovery factor also weighs in favor of approving \nthe proposed settlement. In evaluating this factor, the Court must begin by \nestablishing a “ran ge of possible damages that could be recovered at trial.” Maher v. \nZapata Corp. , 714 F.2d 436, 460 (5th Cir. 1983) ( quotations omitted ). After \nestablishing the range of possible damages that could be recovered at trial, the Court then determines whether the settlement is “pegged at a [fair] point in the range” in \nlight of the “likelihood of prevailing at trial and other factors.” Id.  (quota tions \nomitted).    \n As explained in the discussion of the above factors, see supra Part III(A)(i) –(vi), \nBronstein and the class faced considerable risks in proceeding to trial. Considering these risks, it is far from guaranteed that the class would have rec overed even a \nfraction of the total amount in controversy. Thus, while the high end of the class’s \npotential recovery was $42.7 million , (Dkt.  #65 at 19), the low end of the class’s \npotential recovery was $0.00 —with the balance of probabilities weighing in  favor of \nrecovery closer to the low end than to the high end.  \n The $3,250,000.00 settlement is therefore pegged at a fair point in the range \nof total recovery. It represents 7. 61% of the class’s total potential recovery, which is \na respectable percentage  given the uncertainties of proceeding to trial, the \ncomplexities of class action lawsuits, and the difficulties in proving securities \nviolations.  (Dkt.  #65 at  19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21). Indeed, it is common in class action Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 15 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>16 \n lawsuits for plaintiffs to recover only “three -to-six cents on the dollar.” City of Omaha \nPolice & Fire Ret. Sys. , 2015 WL 965696, at *7.  \nviii. Opinions of Participants and Absent Class Members \n The virtually unanimous support for the proposed settlement also \ndemonstrates its fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy. The named parties and \nclass counsel all believe that the proposed settlement is a favorable outcome for both the active participants i n the litigation and the absent class members. That the \nparties and class counsel unanimously support the proposed settlement is an important fact weighing in favor of its approval because, “absent fraud, collusion, or \nthe like,” the Court “should be hesit ant to substitute its own judgment for that of \ncounsel.” Cotton v. Hinton , 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977). And here, the parties \nand counsel, all of whom are sophisticated, have vigorously defended their respective \npositions, lending further support f or the settlement’s fairness.  \n In addition to the named parties and class counsel, the absent class members \nalso appear to support the proposed settlement. Out of nearly 29,000 potential class \nmembers who received notice of the settlement, and more than 1 ,000 potential class \nmembers who responded to the notice, no potential class members objected to the proposed settlement or validly requested to be excluded from it. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶¶ 7 –8). \nThis lack of objection from the class members supports the “adequacy of the \nsettlement.” Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at *5 (quotations omitted).   Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 16 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>17 \n B. The Class Members Received Adequate Notice of the Proposed \nSettlement .  \n The Court also finds that the class members received adequate notice of the \nproposed settl ement. The adequacy of a class settlement notice is not governed by \n“rigid rules.” Wal -Mart Stores, Inc.  v. Visa U.S.A., Inc., 396  F.3d 96, 114 (2d  Cir. \n2005) ; Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 3 n.1. Instead, the notice must \nsatisfy the “broad reasonableness standard []” imposed by due process and Rule 23(e).  \nIn re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig. , 628 F.3d 185, 197 (5th Cir. 2010) (quotations \nomitted).  To satisfy that standard,  the notice must provide cla ss members with \n“information reasonably necessary” to decide whether t o object to the settlement or \nnot. Id. The standard does not require, however, “actual notice to each party” to be \nbound by the settlement.  Erica P. John Fund, Inc. , 2018 WL 1942227, at * 3 n.1 (citing \nMullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Tr. Co. , 339 U.S. 306, 313 –14 (1950)) .  \n Here, the class notices were adequate both in  timing and content. In terms of \ntiming, class counsel published and distributed the class settlement notices f orty days \nbefore the deadline to object to the settlement. (Dkt.  #56 at 18– 19); (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). \nThese efforts resulted in delivery of notices  to nearly 29,000 potential class members \nby email or postcard before the objection deadline. (Dkt.  #72-1 ¶ 3). The Court finds, \ntherefore, that the notice procedures provided class members ample time to object to \nthe settlement if they  wished to do so. See DeJulius v. New England Health Care \nEmps. Pension Fund , 429  F.3d 935, 947 (10th  Cir. 2005) (holding that the class \nmembers received adequate notice of a class settlement when the notices were “sent \nout nearly two weeks prior to the settlement hearing”).  Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 17 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>30 \n  Amount Involved and Results Obtained. The amount in controversy in this \ncase is significant: $42.7 million, according to Bronstein’s damages expert. (Dkt.  #65 \nat 19). Counsel obtained 7.61% of that amount through the pr oposed settlement.  \n(Dkt.  #65 at 19); (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 21).  Given that plaintiffs typically recover only “three -\nto-six cents on the dollar” in class actions, City of Omaha Police & Fire Ret. Sys. , 2015 \nWL 965696, at *7, that is a favorable result.  See also Parker v. Anderson , 667 F.2d \n1204, 1210 (5th  Cir. 1982) (observing that class settlements can be fair and adequate \neven when they “amount to a fraction of the potential recovery [at trial]” (quotations \nomitted)). This factor supports the requested fee award w ithout need for any \nadjustment.   \nTime Limitations; Nature and Length of Relationship with Client.  The \ntime limitations and client relationship factors also  do not require any adjustment to \nthe requested fee award. As for time limitations, the parties have not identified any \ntiming constraints  imposed by the clients or circumstances. Erica P. John Fund, 2018 \nWL 1942227, at *11 (“This factor does not apply in this case because there is no indication that Lead Plaintiff imposed any time limits in the prosecution of this \ncase.”); see also  In re Combustion, Inc. , 968 F.Supp. at 1135) (“Even though it is \napparent that the Johnson factors must be addressed to ensure  that the resulting fee \nis reasonable, not every factor need be necessarily considered.”).  \n And as for the nature and length of the client relationship, the Court finds that \nclass counsel ably represent ed the class beginning in 2021. Both class counsel and  \nBronstein actively participated in the litigation for its full duration. Considering Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 30 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>31 \n counsel’s dedication to Bronstein and to the class stretching more than a year, the \nrequested fee award adequately compensates counsel. That conclusion is supported \nby Br onstein’s declaration, in which he states that  class counsel regularly discussed \nthe case with him, provided “periodic status reports,” and deserves the requested fees—all facts suggesting that the attorney -client relationship was strong. (Dkt.  #66-\n4 ¶¶ 5–6, 8–9); Erica P. John Fund, 2018 WL 1942227, at *12 (finding that this factor \nweighed in favor of a requested fee award when “the professional relationship with \nLead Plaintiff w as positive”).   \niii. Lodestar Cross- Check  \n A lodestar cross -check  confirms the reasonableness of the fees requested. The \nlodestar method focuses on the work performed as opposed to the recovery obtained. \nTo calculate the lodestar, the court multiplies the attorney’s hourly rate by the hours \nworked.  See Hobbs v. EVO Inc. , 7 F.4th 241, 259 (5th  Cir. 2021).  The burden is on the \nmoving party to establish the reasonableness of both the rate charged and the hours billed. McClain v. Lufkin Indus., Inc. , 649 F.3d 374, 381 (5th Cir. 2011); Swanston v. \nCity of Plano , No. 4:19 -CV-412, 2022 WL 3567059, at *2 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 18, 2022).   \n Here, counsel submitted affidavits and declarations supporting a lodestar \namount of $467,783.00. (Dkt.  #65-2 ¶ 33–34). The affidavits and declaration s do not \ninclude contemporaneous billing records , detailed time entries , or proof of the rate \ntypically charged in the community, as would typically be required to support a claim \nfor attorney’s fees. See Vaughan v. Lewisville In dep. Sch. Dist. , No. 4:19 -CV-109-SDJ, \n2021 WL 6125786, at *5 (E.D. Tex. Dec. 28, 2021); McClain , 649 F.3d at 381– 82. \nHowever, the submitted affidavits and declarations are sufficient under the Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 31 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>32 \n circumstances . No party objected to the fee request. And the Court is employing the \nlodestar method only as a rough cross -check to confirm the reasonableness of the \npercentage award. Turner v. Murphy Oil  USA, Inc. , 472  F.Supp.2d 830, 867 (E.D.  La. \n2007)  (observing that , in performing a lodestar cross -check , the court need not \nscrutinize each time entry and  “representations by class counsel as to total hours \n[worked] may be sufficient” (quotations omitted)).  \n When a lodestar cross -check is applied to  a class -action fee aw ard in a common \nfund case , courts frequently use a multiplier ranging from one to four based on the \nJohnson factors. See, e.g. , Burford , 2012 WL 5471985, at *6 n.1 (approving a 1.78 \nmultiplier and remarking that court s frequently approve multipliers rangin g from \none to four); Di Giacomo v. Plains All Am. Pipeline , No. CV -99-4137, 2001 WL \n34633373, at *10– 11 (S.D.  Tex. Dec. 19, 2001)  (approving a 5.3 multiplier in a \nsecurities class action) .   \n Here, the Johnson factors, for the reasons explained above,  see supra Part \nIII(D)(ii),  support a $1,083,332.00 attorney’s fee  award —which is the lodestar amount \nmultiplied 2.32 times. That multiplier falls in the commonly accepted range. The \nCourt finds that the lodestar c ross-check confirms the reasonableness of the \nrequested fee award.  E. Bronstein and Class Counsel May Recover Reasonable Expenses .  \n \n Bronstein and class counsel may recover reasonable expenses  incurred during \nthe litigation . Bronstein requests $5,000.00 for the considerable time (approximately \nforty hours) he invested in the case communicating with counsel, reviewing Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 32 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>33 \n documents, and participating in settlement negotiations. (Dkt.  #66-4 ¶¶ 3 –7, 11). \nBronstein’s request is author ized under the P SLRA,  which allows a lead plaintiff to \nrecover “reasonable costs and expenses (including lost wages)  directly relating to \nrepresentation of the class.” 15 U.S.C. § 78u -4(a)(4).  \n The Court agrees  that Bronstein invested considerable time and  effort to this \ncase and awards Bronstein  the requested recovery of $5,000 . The award is below what \ncourts have awarded in other class action  cases. See, e.g. , Burford , 2012 WL 5471985, \nat *6 (awarding named plaintiffs up to $15,000.00 in compensation for efforts \nexpend ed representing the class) ; In re Catfish Antitrust Litig. , 939 F.Supp. 493, 504 \n(N.D. Miss. 1996) (awarding $10,000.00).  \n Class Counsel request  reimbursement in the amount of $35,216.89 for \nexpenses incurred representing the  class. (Dkt. #66 at 27, 30 ). Counsel further \nrequests that these expenses be awarded out of the settlement fund in addition to the \n$1,083,332.00 in  attorney’s fees. Because no class member objected to the request , \ncounsel diligently represented the class, and  counsel incurred considerable expense \nwith no guarantee of recovery, the Court finds that the requested amount is \nreasonable under the circumstances and will be awarded.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n The parties and counsel have diligently litigated these consolidated  cases and \nachieved a favorable settlement not only for the named parties, but also for the absent class members. The reasonableness of the settlement is reflected by the lack of any \nobjection to it. The Court finds that the proposed settlement  should be approved, the \nclass certified, and the requested fees and expenses awarded.  Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 33 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>34 \n  It is therefore ORDERED as follows:  \n1. The Court finally approves the proposed settlement agreement, (Dkt.  #55), as \nfair, reasonable, and adequate under the Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure. Its \nterms shall bind all class members.  \n \n2. The Court finally certifies a class of persons or entities that purchased or otherwise acquired Intrusion, Inc. common stock between October 1 4, 2020,  \nand August 26, 2021, both dates inclusive,  and were damaged thereby. The \ncertified class excludes: (a) Defendants; (b) Intrusion, Inc.’s officers, directors, \nand affiliates, at all relevant times; (c) Intrusion. Inc.’s employee retirement or \nbenefit plan(s) and their participants or beneficiaries to the extent they purchased or acquired Intrusion, Inc. stock through any such plan(s); (d) any entity in which Defendants have or had controlling interest; (e) immediate \nfamily members of any excluded person; (f) the legal representatives, heirs, \nsuccess ors, or assigns of any excluded person or entity; and (g) all those who \nsubmit timely and valid requests  for exclusion.  \n \n3. The Court dismisses with prejudice all claims in this action between the class \nand Defendants.  \n \n4. The Court approves the parties’ propo sed allocation plan as a fair and \nreasonable method of allocating the settlement fund among class members. The Court directs the parties to distribute  through the claims administer  the \nsettlement fund in accordance with the settlement agreement and stipula tion. \n(Dkt.  #55).  \n \n5.  The Court awards class counsel $1,083,332.00 in attorney’s fees and \n$35,216.89 in expenses. The Court awards lead Plaintiff Andrew Bronstein \n$5,000.00 for expenses.   \n \n  \n \n \n Case 4:21-cv-00374-SDJ     Document 11     Filed 12/16/22     Page 34 of 34 PageID #: \n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a trademark dispute between OpenAI, Inc. and Open Artificial Intelligence, Inc., led by Guy Ravine, over the use of the \"OpenAI\" name. The court granted OpenAI, Inc. summary judgment, ruling that Ravine's claims failed to prove a valid trademark due to a lack of secondary meaning and exclusivity, and found that OpenAI, Inc. successfully established secondary meaning of its trademark before Guy Ravine used it in commerce for competing products.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether Guy Ravine’s use of the \"Open AI\" mark constitutes trademark infringement against OpenAI, Inc., focusing on whether either party had a protectible ownership interest in the trademark through valid registration or acquired secondary meaning.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that OpenAI, Inc. acquired secondary meaning in the use of its trademark before Ravine offered his similar products commercially. Consequently, the court found in favor of OpenAI, Inc. on all its claims and counterclaims relating to trademark infringement, canceling Ravine’s trademark registration and permanently enjoining him from using the \"Open AI\" mark.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you and a friend both start selling candy, and you both call your company \"Sweet Treats.\" Your friend copies your exact candy recipes after seeing how popular they are, but they use the same name as you, causing customers to mix up who sells what. The court decides only you can use the name \"Sweet Treats\" because you made candy people know about before your friend started copying you. Your friend has to stop using the name to sell their candies because it's confusing people into thinking they are buying yours.",

(“Open AI ”) and Guy Ravine ’s (for clarity, collectively, “Ravine’s ”) \ncounterclaims . Each insist s that they have a valid trademark interest in their identically named —but  \nfor a space—artificial intelligence  (“AI”) companies. The parties also filed motions to strike in \nresponse to the other’s briefing. Having carefully considered the parties’ briefing , evidence,  and \nargument at the July 8, 2025 hearing, the Court G RANT S OpenAI’s motion for summary judgment , \nGRANTS  IN PART Ravine’s motion to strike, and D ENIES  OpenAI’s motion to strike.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \n OpenAI was founded nearly a decade ago in December 2015. (Declaration of Greg \nBrockman (“Brockman Decl.”), Dkt. No. 243, ¶ 2  and Ex. A). By all accounts, OpenAI was a  \nleader in  AI research and development from its founding. Prominent publications, including The  \nNew York Times  and The Wall Street Journal   featured the company before it had launched a single \nproduct. (Declaration of Aaron Perahia (“Perahia Decl.”), Dkt. No. 233, Ex. 86.)   Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 1 of 19 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Before OpenAI’s founding, a relatively unknown entity  named Open AI was in the works. \nGuy Ravine , Open AI’s founder, hoped to create tools that would allow those interested in artificial \nintelligence to collaborate on new developments. He  purchased the “open.ai” domain name  in \nMarch 2015—months before OpenAI’s founding. (Declaration of Breeanna Brewer (“Brewer \nDecl.”), Dkt. No. 258, Ex. 60.) The day after OpenAI’s founding, Ravine applied to register  the \ntrademark  Open AI with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) . (Perahia Decl., Ex. 72 \nat 1, 7–8.)  The USPTO rejected  Ravine’s application because the mark was descriptive and Ravine  \nhad not demonstrated  use in commerce, so Ravine filed a substitute specimen —an image of the \nhome screen for Ravine’s product “Hub.” (Declaration of Guy Ravine (“Ravine Decl.”), Dkt. No. \n256, ¶ 29; Perahia Decl., Ex. 72 at 31 .) The USPTO again rejected Ravine’s application  and Ravine \nelected to register  the mark on the Supplemental Register. ( Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 88 .)  \n In the meantime, OpenAI continued to develop commercially. It launched its first product —\nOpenAI Gym —in April 2016. (Brockman Decl., ¶ 13, Ex. B at 6.) OpenAI  continued to research \nand develop successful A I products, including ChatGPT  (a generative AI chatbot)  and Dall -E 2 (an \nimage generator ). (Brockman Decl. ¶  37; Declaration of James Dyett ( “Dyett Dec l.”), Dkt. No. 228, \n¶¶ 16–21.)  OpenAI was also  not able to  register its mark  with the USPTO : one, because the mark  \nwas descriptive and , two, because Ravine  actively opposed. (Brewer Decl., Exs. 19, 25; Declaration \nof Rebecca McCurry, ( “McCurry Decl .”), Dkt. No. 229, ¶¶ 7, 8 and Ex. G.)  \n After the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Dall -E 2, Ravine launched similar chatbot and \nimage generator products on his open.ai domain. (Ravine Decl., ¶¶ 45 –50.)  OpenAI then filed this \naction  in August 2023 to litigate  the parti es’ trademark rights and stop customer confusion.  \n The salient  facts relevant to the resolution of the pending motions are cited in Court’s \nanalysis section of this Order. The Court omits those facts here to expedite this Order  given \nlooming trial deadlines.  \nII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK  \nSummary judgment is appropriate  whe re a “movant shows that there is no genuine dispute \nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.  R. Civ. P.  \n56(a) . A fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 2 of 19 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  law.” Anderson v. Liberty  Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S.  242, 248 (1986) . A dispute is “genuine” if there is \nevidence in the record sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to decide in favor of the nonmoving \nparty. Id.  “If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment \nmay be granted.”  Id. at 249–50.  \nThe Court views the inferences reasonably drawn from the materials in the record in the \nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party and “may not weigh the evidence or make credibility \ndeterminations .” Matsushita Elec.  Indus. Co. v.  Zenith  Radio Corp., 475 U.S.  574, 587–88 (1986)  \nand Freeman  v. Arpaio, 125 F.3d 732, 735 (9th  Cir. 1997) , overruled  on other  grounds  by Shakur  \nv. Schriro, 514 F.3d 878,  884–85 (9th  Cir. 2008) , respectively.  Conclusory, speculative testimony \nin affidavits and moving papers is insufficient to raise genuine issues of fact and defeat summary \njudgment. Thornhill Publ ’g Co., Inc. v. GTE Corp. , 594 F.2d 730, 738 (9th Cir. 1979).  \nBecause of the “intensely factual nature of trademark disputes,” summary judgment is \ngenerally disfavored in trademark cases and should be granted sparingly. Rearden LLC v. Rearden \nCommerce, Inc. , 683 F.3d 1190, 1202 (9th Cir. 2012) . \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA dozen  claims are in dispute. OpenAI advances five claims against Ravine : (1) federal \ntrademark infringement and unfair competition ( Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)) ; (2) common \nlaw trademark infringement; (3) fraudulent registration; (4) cancellation —no bona fide use; and (5) \ncancellation —misrepresenting source. Ravine advances seven counterclaims against OpenAI: (1) \nLanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) ; (2) Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114; (3) common law trademark \ninfringement; (4) declaratory judgment of non- infringement of trademark under the Lanham Act, \n(5) declaratory judgment of non- infringement of common law trademark, (6) declaratory judgment \nof ownership of Open AI mark; and (7) de claratory judgment of trademark invalidity. The Court \nwill group its analysis of those twelve claims into two categories: cancellation and trademark \ninfringement.  \n \n Cancellation of Ravine’s “Open  AI” Mark  (Claims 3, 4, and 5 ; Counterclaim  2) \n A party may seek to cancel a registered trademark that was procured  based on fraud. Robi v. \nFive Platters, Inc., 918 F.2d 1439, 1444 (9th Cir. 1990) . The moving party must prove , by clear and Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 3 of 19 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  convincing evidence, “ a false representation regarding a material fact, the registrant ’s knowledge or \nbelief that the representation is false, the intent to induce reliance upon the misrepresentation and \nreasonable reliance thereon, and damages proximately resulting from the reliance.” Id. ; OTR Wheel \nEngg, Inc. v. W. Worldwide Servs., Inc., 897 F.3d 1008, 1119 (9th Cir. 2018) ; see also I n re Bose \nCorp., 580 F.3d 1240, 1245 (Fed.

Ravine argues \nthat genuine disputes  of material fact  exist about whether Ravine submitted false representation s to \nthe USPTO  and whether Ravine intended to deceive the USPTO . He does not dispute that \nplaintiff ’s factual record  satisfies  the remaining elements.  \n False Representation to the USPTO  \nSubmitting a false specimen to the USPTO is a material misrepresentation. Look Cycle Int ’l \nv. Kunshan Qiyue Outdoor Sports Goods Co., 2024 WL 3739358, at *16 (T.T.A.B. Aug. 9, 2024) (“The falsity of the specimens is a material misrepresentation, as they must be accepted by the \nExamining Attorney to demonstrate use in commerce for a Section 1(a) use -based application \nbefore being passed to publication and eventual registration.”).  That includes submitting a \nspecimen  that does not illustrate  actual use in commerce. Dimas v. Matilde , 2015 WL 5768341, at \n*1, *4 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2015) ( granting summary judgment of mark cancellation where \ndefendant did not rebut that specimens were “fakes” that were “created solely to present to the USPTO .”) Ravine argues that factual disputes remain  because the specimen Ravine submitted to \nthe USPTO was not a “mock -up” and was “online” and “for use by the public.” (Oppo. at 19.) \nThose argument s are irrelevant to the claim before the Court . \nThe following record evidence reflects that Ravine made two misrepresentations to the \nUSPTO: (1) that his product Hub existed in 2015 when he applied for the “Open  AI” trademark; \nand (2) that Hub was used in commerce : \n \n• Plaintiff submitted evidence show ing that Guy Ravine applied for a trademark on \nDecember 11, 2015, the day  OpenAI announced its founding. (Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 4 of 19 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1.) That application dep icted Ravine ’s Open AI  “landing page” found at www. open.ai , \nwhich  stated that an “announcement would be made soon.” ( Id. at 7–8.)  \n \n• On March 29, 2016, the USPTO responded to Ravine’s trademark application. ( Id. at \n12.) The USPTO rejected Ravine’s application “because the specimen does not show the \napplied -for mark in use in commerce  . . . .” ( Id. at 13.)  Six months later,  just before his \nfiling deadline, Ravine submitted a “substitute specimen” which was an image of Hub ’s \nhome screen . (Ravine Decl. , ¶ 29; Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 31–32.) Ravine  admits that \nhe had just released  Hub  to the public , meaning that Hub was not available as of the date \nof Ravine’s initial filing.  (Ravine Decl. , ¶¶ 28–29; Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 34.)  That \nsubstitute filing required Ravine to represent that “[t] he substitute (or new,  or originally \nsubmitted, if appropriate) specimen(s) was/were in use in commerce at least as early as \nthe filing date of the application.” (Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 34.)  \n \n• The hub specimen also included planted comments from Ravine’s employee  Nikita \nGaer, who designed Hub, which does not  demonstrate  actual use in commerce. ( Ravi ne \nDecl. , ¶ 28; McCurry Decl. , Exs. B, C, D, E ; Perahia Decl. , Ex. 16, Deposition of N. \nGaer  (“Gaer Tr.”)  at 226:18- 231:2; 245:20–15.)  Nor does Ravine state  that anyone used \nHub other than the planted post s. Instead , he argues that  Hub was available for use . \n(Ravine Decl. ¶ ¶ 29, 30.)  \n \n• On March 22, 2017, the USPTO rejected Ravine ’s second application because the  Open \nAI mark “merely describes a feature of the applicant’s services.” (Perahia Decl., Ex. 72 \nat 62.) On August 1, 2017, Ravine registered the Open AI mark on the USPTO’s Supplemental Register. (Reg. No. 5,258,002; Perahia Decl. Ex. 72 at 62–63 , 88.)  \nNo genuine dispute of material fact exists relating to Ravine’s actual misrepresentations to \nthe USPTO. Hub was not available in 2015, nor  did the specimen show actual use in commerce.   \n   Knowledge and Intent to Induce Reliance and Mislead the  USPTO  \n In trademark cases, “ because direct evidence of deceptive intent is rarely available, such \nintent can be inferred from indirect and circumstantial evidence.” Bose , 580 F.3d at 1245. District \ncourts in the Ninth Circuit have applied  a “knowledge” standard and have not lowered the bar to \n“reckless disregard.” La Terra Fina USA, LLC v. Reser’s Fine Foods, Inc., 2024 WL 1973468, at \n*3 (N.D. Cal. May 3, 2024). The following record evidence reflects that Ravine acted with knowledge and intent to deceive the USTP O:  \n \n• Ravine submitted the substitute  specimen shortly after Hub was created. ( Perahia Decl. , \nEx. 72 at 33–38, Ex. 10, Deposition of Guy Ravine  (“Ravine Tr.”) , at 228:23- 230:16; \nRavine Decl., ¶ ¶ 28–29.)  Ravine cannot argue in good faith that he did not know  the \ncontent of  what he submitted.  \n Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 5 of 19 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • Ravine submitted a version of Hub which did not include (or had removed) date stamps. \n(Compare Perahia Decl. , Ex. 72 at 33–38 with  Perahia Decl. , Ex. 84.) Including those \ndates would have shown that the substitute specimen was not available in December 2015.  \nRavine’s arguments that he did not know that his actions  violated the law  are not supported \nby the contemporaneous record. The Court need not credit self-serving declarations given the \nevidence presented. F.T.C. v. Publ’g Clearing House, Inc., 104 F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir.1997) (“A \nconclusory, self-serving affidavit, lacking detailed facts and any supporting evidence, is insufficient \nto create a genuine issue of material fact.”).  Further, deflective arguments that attorneys regularly \nsubmit false information to the USPTO do not persuade. Two wrongs do not make a right. After \nconsidering the evidence, the Court finds that no genuine dispute of material fact exists as to \nOpenAI’s cancellation claim s.  \nThe Court thus G\nRANTS  OpenAI summary judgment as to its affirmative claims (3) \nfraudulent registration; (4) cancellation —no bona fide use; and (5) cancellation—misrepresenting \nsource and Ravine’s corresponding counterclaim  (2) Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1114.1 \n Trademark Infringement Claims  \n To prove a federal or common law  trademark infringement clai m, a party must show (1) a \nprotectible ownership interest in a valid mark, and (2) that defendant’s use of the mark, or a substantially similar mark, is likely to cause consumer confusion. Network Automation Inc. v. \nAdvanced Systems Concepts, Inc., 638 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir. 2011) ; see also Grupo Gigante SA \nDe CV v. Dallo & Co., 391 F.3d 1088, 1100 (9th Cir. 2004) (“As a general matter, trademark \nclaims under California law are “substantially congruent” with federal claims and thus lend \nthemselves to the same analysis .”) Both parties concede that the two marks  (OpenAI vs. Open AI) \nare likely to, and already have, caused customer confusion. The pending Lanham Act and common law trademark  infringement claims, then, will hinge on whether either O penAI or Ravine has  a \nprotectible ownership interest in a valid mark. The Court will first consider Ravine’s counterclaims \nand then turn to OpenAI’s affirmative infringement claims.  \n \n1 Ravine’s Lanham Act ( Count 2, 15 U.S.C. § 1114) claim cannot succeed without a \nregistered mark. The Court has cancelled that mark.

When, as here, a trademark is not registered, or found not to have been properly \nregistered, a party may have a valid mark if it is (1) inherently distinctive, or  (2) descriptive but has \nacquired secondary meaning. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 769 (1992).\n2 \na) Ravine’s Open AI m ark is not inherently distinctive . \nRavine first argues that the Open AI mark is suggestive, not descriptive, and thus is \ninherently distinctive. A descriptive mark describes some aspect or characteristic of a product, \nwhereas a suggestive mark requires imagination or multi-stage reasoning. Lahoti v. VeriCheck, Inc. , \n586 F.3d 1190, 1198 (9th Cir. 2009).  \nThe Court concurs with the USPTO ’s determin ation  that Ravine’s Open AI mark was \n“descriptive” because it “merely describes a feature of the applicant’s services.” (Perahia Decl., Ex. \n72 at 62–63.) While not necessary here, d istrict courts may defer to the USPTO’s classification. \nLahoti , 586 F.3d at  1199 (9th Cir. 2009) (“ Deference to the PTO ’s classification decision is \nsensible because the PTO has special expertise that we lack on this fact -intensive issue .”); OpenAI, \nInc. v.

Automated Pet Care Prods., LLC v. PurLife Brands, Inc., \n670 F. Supp. 3d 946, 951 (N.D. Cal. 2023) ; 2 McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition \n§ 19.43 (5th ed. 2023) (“ An application for registration on the Supplemental Register is an implied \nadmission that the term is not inherently distinctive .”) Moreover, throughout the litigation, Ravine \nhas admitted that the Open AI mark is descriptive. ( See e.g. Dkt. No. 100, Open AI Counterclaim, \n¶ 189 (claiming that OpenAI, Inc. stole Open AI ’s term  “from a literally open AI company that has \nused it to pursue a truly open AI.”); Dkt. No. 138, Second Amended Counterclaim, ¶ 35 (“When \npeople heard the words ‘Open AI,’ they understood what the organization was about.’”) ; Id. ¶ 33 \n(“What Ravine eventually realized is that he could build on the ideology of his open collaboration \nplatform . . . . researchers were actually motivated  by the ideology of open sharing.”)   \nRavine maintains that the Open AI mark’s classification is best left for a jury, citing to an \nexpert report from Dr. Leonard, a linguist, who opined on the meaning of the terms “Open” and “AI.” Dr. Leonard’s report does not create a genuine dispute of material fact. Dr. Leonard opines \nthat the term Open AI does “not describe the products/serv ices provided by [Ravine’s Open AI]” \nbecause the term open conveys many potential specialized meanings. (Leonard Rept., ¶¶ 61–63, 67.) Dr. Leonard misses the point. That there are other  possible meanings of the term “open” that \ndo not describe Open AI’s features, does not detract from the (at least) one meaning that does  \ndescribe Ravine’s product. Lahoti , 586 F.3d at 1 201. The correct inquiry is “whether, when the \nmark is seen on the goods or services, it immediately conveys information about their nature .” Id.  \nDr. Leonard ignores, and otherwise fails to refute, the USPTO’s finding that “open” is descriptive as applied to Ravine’s mark because “it indicates that the applicant’s website allows public or non-\nproprietary information sharing.” (Perahia Decl., Ex. 72 at 63.) Ravine personally attested to \nUSPTO about the nature of his collaboration tools. An expert’s opinion which ignores the evidence \nin the case does not create a genuine dispute of material fact.  \nTaken together, the Court concludes that no reasonable juror could find, based on the \nevidence presented, that Ravine’s Open AI mark is suggestive.\n3  \n \n3 Because the Court finds that the Open AI mark is descriptive, the Court need not resolve \nwhether the market penetration test applies  to inherently distinctive marks . Those common law Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 8 of 19 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  b) Ravine’s descriptive mark has not acquired secondary meaning.   \nA descriptive mark “can receive trademark protection if it has acquired distinctiveness by \nestablishing ‘secondary meaning’ in the marketplace.” Yellow Cab Co. of Sacramento v. Yellow \nCab of Elk Grove, Inc., 419 F.3d 925, 927 (9th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). Here, “[a] plaintiff \nmust show its mark achieved secondary meaning before a defendant first used the mark.” OpenAI, \nInc., 2024 WL 4763687, at *1 (emphasis supplied) (citing Levi Strauss & Co. v. Blue Bell, Inc., 778 \nF.2d 1352, 1358 (9th Cir. 1985) (“Strauss was required to prove that the tab as used on shirts had \nacquired secondary meaning by 1976, when Blue Bell began using a protruding label on shirts.”) In \nthe Ninth Circuit, courts analyze the following relevant  factors : (1) consumer perception and \nwhether purchasers of the product associate the trademark with the producer; (2) advertising ; (3) \nlength and manner of use; (4) whether the use has been exclusive; (5) copying; and (6) actual confusion. Yellow Cab, 419 F.3d at 930.\n4   \nHere, Ravine cites no evidence to suggest that his Open AI mark acquired secondary \nmeaning at any point in time . Rather, Ravine merely submits the conclusory statement that “ a \nreasonable jury could still conclude that Defendants acquired secondary meaning through their use \nand promotion of the mark.” (Oppo. at 19, n. 5.) Argument alone is insufficient to  withstand a \nmotion for summary judgment. Olivier v. Baca , 913 F.3d 852, 857 (9th Cir. 2019) (Where “the \nopposing party will have the burden of proof at trial, the moving party need only point out that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.”) \nNo genuine disputes of material fact remain  about Ravine’s Lanham Act and common law \ntrademark infringement claims. On that basis, the Court G\nRANTS  OpenAI’s motion for summary \n \nbased territorial  and market considerations are intertwined  with  a descriptive mark’s secondary \nmeaning test.  \n4 See also , Ninth Circuit Model Jury Instructions, § 15.11 Infringement—Elements —\nValidity —Distinctiveness —Secondary Meaning and cases cited therein ; P & P Imports LLC v. \nJohnson Enters., LLC , 46 F.4th 953, 961 (9th Cir. 2022) (considering copying and consumer \nconfusion) \n Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 9 of 19 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  judgment as to  counterclaims  (1) Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), (3) common law trademark \ninfringement, and (6) declaratory judgment that Ravine owns the mark.5 \n \n OpenAI’s Trademark Infringement Claims (Claims 1 and 2, Counterclaims 4, \n5, and 7)  \nOpenAI advances two trademark infringement claims against Ravine: Lanham Act ( 15 \nU.S.C. § 1125(a)) and common law trademark infringement. The Court analyzes whether plaintiff \nhas a protectible interest  in the OpenAI trademark . \nHere, O penAI does not dispute that its mark is descriptive. Based on the law cited above, \nthe Court’s infringement analysis, then, will turn on whether OpenAI acquired  secondary meaning, \nand if so, its  scope and timing. More precisely, the Court must determine whether OpenAI acquired \nsecondary meaning before  Ravine first used the Open AI mark in commerce. OpenAI, Inc., 2024 \nWL 4763687, at *1.  \nOpenAI offers two dates by which it argues that it acquired secondary meaning: first , \nNovember 2022, by which time it submits  that OpenAI acquired nationwide secondary meaning \nand second , January 2017, by which time it asserts secondary meaning amongst AI researchers.  The \nCourt considers the evidence submitted. Because the Court finds that OpenAI acquired nationwide \nsecondary meaning by at least November 2022, it need not address the January 2017 period.  \na) Use of the Mark , Scope, and the Legal Framework. \nRavine argues that he is the first user of the  descriptive mark , and thus, cannot be liable for \ntrademark infringement.   \nThe law, however, “does not protect or permit a ‘first user’s’ expansion beyond its original \nproduct line into an area occupied by an ‘intervening junior user’ who has established its own rights \nin the mark.” RXD Media, LLC v. IP Application Dev. LLC , 986 F.3d 361, 371 (4th Cir. 2021) \n(citing 4 J. McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 24:20 (5th ed. 2020) ; \nFuller Prods. Co. v.

Said differently, the parties are each limited to  the original product line and  the natural zone \nof expansion. Id . Ravine cites no  law or evidence justif ying an expansion of his  use of the mark to \nthe entire  AI industry.  \nRXD Media v. IP Application Development instructs . There, the Fourth Circuit affirmed the \ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment where two companies  each  used the “ipad” mark. RXD \nMedia, LLC v. IP Application Dev. LLC , 986 F.3d 361 (4th Cir. 2021) . In 2007, plaintiff RXD \nreleased “ipad.mobi,” which allowed users to make simple, online lists on an internet -based \nnotepad. Id. at 366. Then  in January 2010, defendant Apple released its touch -screen tablet called \nthe “iPad.” Id. A few years later, in October 2016, RXD  launched a “rebranded” website using the \n“ipad” name which  offered “cloud storage” services that allowed users to upload photographs, \nvideos, music, and documents. Id. at 367. RXD filed suit, seeking declaratory judgment that its use \nof the “ipad” mark did not infringe Apple’s rights because RXD’s use of the mark “preceded \nApple’s use and Apple’s establishment of a secondary meani ng in a descriptive mark, precluding \nany possible infringement by RXD.” Id. at 368. The Fourth Circuit sided with Apple, in part because Apple achieved secondary meaning in its descriptive mark before October 2016—the date \nRXD rebranded and offered new services . Id. at 371. The court concluded that RXD’s “wholly \naltered use of the mark on its ‘ipadtoday.com’ website in 2016, on the heels of Apple’s commercial success in releasing the iPad device” was not entitled to trademark protection. Id. Although prior \nusers are generally permitted to “continuing using a mark in the manner that was legal when first \nused” , RXD had expanded “beyond its original product line into an area occupied by an \n‘intervening junior user’ who had established its own rights in the mark.” Id. \nThe evidence  in this case is similar. Initially, OpenAI and Ravine operated in different \nlanes , using their respective marks for different purposes . Ravine admits the same. Although his \nargument vacillates on each party’s “agreed” offerings , he cannot escape his  admi ssion that \nplaintiff’s concurrent use of the Open AI mark was acceptable to him because “both parties would use their respective marks for their respective goods and services.” (Ravine Decl., ¶ 20.)

(Ravine Decl.,  \n¶¶ 7, 12, 20, 25, 30–31, 35; Ex. 11.) OpenAI, on the other hand, was developing generative AI tools as an AI research company. (Brockman Decl., ¶¶ 13, 15, 17–37; Ex. B.)  \nThe Court finds that OpenAI and Ravine—while both related to AI—offered different types \nof products (or services) in different segments.  \nb) OpenAI and Secondary Meaning in November 2022. \nIn November 2022, Ravine pivoted away from messaging platforms and launched  “Boom,” \nan AI image generator. (Ravine Decl., ¶ 45.) Several  months prior, OpenAI had launched its own \nAI image generator, Dall -E 2. (Brockman Decl., ¶ 37; Dyett Decl. , ¶ 11.)  \nThe Court finds that even assuming that Ravine was first to use the Open AI mark in \ncommerce (which is highly debatable), when Ravine launched Boom, he launched “a product much different and much more sophisticated” than his previous collaboration tools. RXD Media , 986 F.3d \nat 372. That pivot makes November 2022 the relevant date by which OpenAI must have acquired secondary meaning as the intervening junior user  which had historically used the mark for different \nproducts or services.  \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that no reasonable juror could conclude that \nOpenAI did not acquire secondary meaning by November 2022. Each factor considered in the \nNinth Circuit\n6 weighs in favor of secondary meaning: \n \n6 Yellow Cab, 419 F.3d at 930 (9th Cir. 2005) (“ To determine whether a descriptive mark \nhas secondary meaning, a finder of fact considers: (1) whether actual purchasers of the product \nbearing the claimed trademark associate the trademark with the producer, (2) the degree and manner of advertising under the claimed trademark, (3) the length and manner of use of the claimed trademark, and (4) whether use of the claimed trademark has been exclusive.”); P & P Imports LLC v.

( Dyett Decl. ¶ 26 , Ex. S.)  By September 2022, over 1.5 \nmillion users were creating over 2 million images per day with Dall- E 2. (Id. ¶ 14, \nEx. I.) In November 2022, those numbers increased to 3 million users creating 4 \nmillion images per day. ( Id. ¶ 15.) \n \n• In March 2022, search engines like Google and Bing exclusively associated the term “OpenAI” with plaintiff on the first page of results, featuring information panels about the company and suggesting only OpenAI -related searches. ( Perahia \nDecl., Ex . 63.)  In March 2022, OpenAI was listed among Time’s “100 Most \nInfluential Companies of 2022.” ( Id., Ex. 65.)  \n \n• GitHub data from November 2022 shows that tens of thousands of users ( i.e. other \nAI developers) saved personal copies of OpenAI’s products for their building repository. (Brockman Decl., Exs. D, E.)  OpenAI’s expert, Dr. Lipson, states that \npeople  in the AI industry frequently used OpenAI Gym, and many research papers \nwere written based on the product. ( Declaration of Hod L ipson, ( “Lipson Decl.” ), \nDkt. No. 231, Ex. A at ¶¶ 22–24, 26, 27.)  \n \n• On November 15, 2022, OpenAI announced the release of ChatGPT, which was \nan instant hit . (Dye tt Decl. , ¶¶16–21.)  Tech journals referred to ChatGPT as “one \nof the fastest growing services ever” with over 100 million weekly users and 2 million developers using OpenAI’s API. (Perahia Decl., Ex. 68.) Others described Open AI —since launching ChatGPT —as a “viral sensation ” and “household \nname.” ( Id., Ex. 57.)  \n \nRavine , for his part, attempts to argue  that the following three points in the record create a \ngenuine dispute of material fact . The Court disagrees . \nOne, OpenAI did not commission a consumer survey. True,  but “[c]onsumer survey \nevidence is not required.” Eko Brands, LLC v. Adrian Rivera Maynez Enters., Inc., No. 20- 35369, \n2021 WL 3630225, at *1  (9th Cir. Aug. 17, 2021) . Ravine did not commission a consumer survey \neither.   \nTwo, an internal brand s urvey supposedly shows that OpenAI had low brand awareness in \n2023. (Brewer Decl., ¶ 37.) The survey, however, studied a legally irrelevant population. The Court \nagrees with  OpenAI that the correct inquiry is whether consumers  of OpenAI’s products associate Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 13 of 19 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the mark with OpenAI , not the opinions of people who have never heard of, or do not use, \nOpenAI’s products  (which the survey included) .  \nThree, Ravine offered an expert  opinion. T hat each side’s experts rendered opinions on the \nabove -mentioned internal survey does not change the fact that the survey  is not relevant in the first \ninstance.  Dr. Chiagouris  opines  that the internal survey shows that OpenAI had not ac quired \nsecondary meaning in 2023. (Chiagouris Decl., Ex 1.) OpenAI’s expert , Dr. Steckel, analyzed the \nunderlying survey data and determined that when a consumer responded that they used  an OpenAI \nproduct (like ChatGPT), rather than having “heard” of the product, concluded that 60% recognized \nOpenAI. Generally, figures over 50% are regarded as clearly sufficient  to satisfy the  test, but \nfigures of 46%, 48%, 39% and 37 percent have also been found sufficient. See 5 McCarthy on \nTrademarks and Unfair Competition § 32:190 (5th ed. 2025).  \nFactor 2: Advertisement. The following facts demonstrate that there are no genuine \ndisputes of material fact as to whether OpenAI advertised under the OpenAI trademark:  \n \n• OpenAI launched popular AI products (Gym, Universe, API, Roboschool, \nBaselines, Gym Retro, Spinning Up, Dota 2, GPT, ChatCPT, DALL -E). Those \nproducts were widely publicized and covered in national media and online. \n(Brockman Decl. , Exs. B, C, D, E, G and J ; Perahia Decl., Ex. 86. ) \n \n• OpenAI participated in, and sponsored, leading AI industry conferences. (Brockman Decl., Exs. M, H.)  \n \n• OpenAI was active on social media, YouTube, its blog, and in publishing industry leading research papers. (Brockman Decl., Exs. F, G, H, J, K.)  \n \nRavine argues that OpenAI did not engage in traditional advertising, but that argument does \nnot create a genuine dispute of material fact, especially in a nascent industry. Ravine cites  no law \nthat indicates that “traditional” advertising is required in all cases.  It is more appropriate to evaluate \nmetrics in the industry at issue.  \nFactor 3: Extent of Use. The following facts demonstrate that there are no genuine disputes \nof material fact that OpenAI  used the OpenAI mark for a sufficient period of time:  \n Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 14 of 19 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • OpenAI announced its founding in December 2015. (Brockman Decl., Ex. A.) \nOpenAI first used the mark in commerce, by launching its first product OpenAI \nGym , on April 27, 2016. ( Id. ¶ 13, Ex. B at 6.)  \n \n• Since April 2016, Ope nAI has since released over 20 AI products or services. ( Id., \n¶¶ 13 –38.) \n \n• By November 2022, OpenAI had used its mark in continuous commerce for just \nunder seven years . “[S]ubstantial and continuous use of a mark in commerce for \nfive years is prima facie evidence of secondary meaning.” Jason Scott Collection, Inc. v. Trendily Furniture, LLC , 68 F.4th 1203, 1216 (9th Cir. 2023). \nRavine does not dispute that for the 2022 period, length of use weighs in favor of secondary \nmeaning. Ravine merely attacks OpenAI’s evidence by claiming that the use referenced was not \n“prominently displayed.” Ravine cites to no law to indicate that the Court should use this additional \ncharacterization.  Accordingly, the argument does not persuade and in many ways is contrary to the \nrecord cited above.     \nFactor 4: Exclusivity. With respect to this factor, e xclusivity of use means “whether the \ntrademark owner’s use of the mark was substantially  exclusive.” Converse, Inc. v. International \nTrade Commission Skechers USA, Inc., 909 F.3d 1110, 1122 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (emphasis supplied.)  \nAll of OpenAI’s  evidence, cited above, demonstrates that by 2022, OpenAI was using the \nmark in commerce in its field of use.  \nRavine argues that OpenAI’s use was not exclusive because he released several tools (the \nInitial Collaboration, Hub, the Evolved Collaboration Tool, and Decentralized) during the relevant period. An analysis of the evidence, however, demonstrates that few, if any, people actually used those tools.\n7  \n \n \n7 Much of the “use” evidence Ravine cites in support of his opposition comes in the form of \nwitness declarations. Those witnesses are exclusively former employees, friends, or investors in \nRavine’s litigation.  Nikita Gaer, Sergey Belkin, Mattia Iavarone, and Kirk McMurray are former \nRavine employees. (Gaer Decl., ¶ 3; Belkin Decl., ¶¶ 5 –6; Iavarone Decl.,  ¶ 3; McMurray Decl., \n¶ 3.) Deborah Reynolds was Ravine’s “friend” who hosted Ravine on more than 50 occasions and invested $450,000 in Ravine’s company “ We Communicate.” (Declaration of Dylan Scher, (Scher \nDecl., Ex. G) Reynolds Tr. 74:7–76:1; 135:1 –136:10.) Tom Gruber is funding Ravine’s litigation \nagainst OpenAI. (Dkt. No. 177.) Ravi ne does not submit any evidence from genuine third-party \nusers.   Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 15 of 19 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • Ravine does not dispute that Open AI stopped hosting the Initial Collaboration \nTool in February 2016, meaning Ravine’ s use was not continuous. (Dkt. No. \n279-3, RSUF, Fact 31 ).  \n \n• Ravine has not presented evidence that Hub was used in commerce. Hub was a “discourse- based project” that “included features such as a message board where \nusers could post problems and solutions related to AI.” (Ravine Decl., ¶ 25, Ex. 11.). There is no evidence of genuine third-party users on Hub. ( Declaration of \nLuke Tenery (“ Tenery Decl. ”), Dkt. No. 277, Ex. A at ¶¶ 85 –86; Perahia Decl., \nEx. 14, Deposition of L. Tenery, at 152:3–14.) The only evidence of use proffered consisted of 40 comments, but those comments were from Ravine’s own Open AI employee Nikita Gaer. (Declaration of Seth Nielson , (“Nielson  \nDecl. ”), Dkt. No. 230, Ex A at ¶ 114; (Gaer Decl., ¶ 15 ; Perahia Decl.; Ex. 13 at \n215:20-216:7, 225:1-24; 231:3-231:10, 172:2-11, 257:3-5; McCurry Decl., Exs. B–E.) OpenAI’s expert concludes that Hub was not a functional website accessible to third -party users. (Nielson Decl., Ex A at ¶ 116.) \n \n• Ravine’s expert admits that, despite  that Ravine may have created the Evolved \nCollaboration Tool in 2017, it did not have a registered user until June 19, 2020. (Tenery Decl. , ¶ 94.) At  best, as Ravine admits , the Evolved Collaboration Tool \nhad a mere 37 U.S. users. (RSUF Fact 37.) OpenAI’s expert states that the timing coincides with the launch of OpenAI’s API and  suggests that any users \nlikely  inadvertently visited Ra vine’ s cite . (Nielson Decl., Ex. A ¶ 154.) Further, \nat one point, the Evolved Collaboration Tool redirected to OpenAI’s website. (Perahia Decl. Ex. 10, Ravine Dep. Tr. 185:23–186:10; Gaer Decl. ¶  18.)  \n \n• Ravine’s next tool, Decentralized, was released in October 2017. Ravine’s forensic expert admits that between October 25, 2017 and November 16, 2022, only 10 “unique editors” used Decentralized. (Tenery Decl. Ex. A ¶ 96.) OpenAI’s expert concluded that those “unique editors” included Ravine’s administrators, test accounts, and foreign registrants that appear to be spam, or otherwise fake,  accounts (i.e. mike@mike.com). (Nielson Decl., Ex. A at ¶¶  \n117–143.) \n \nThe Court finds as a matter of law that the minimal use presented does not rise to a level to \nraise a genuine dispute of material fact that OpenAI used the mark exclusively or substantially \nexclusively. \nFactors 5 and 6: Copying and Actual Confusion.\n8 Neither party contests that there was \nactual confusion. \n \n8 OpenAI does not submit evidence of “demonstrated utility” or that OpenAI used the mark \nto increase the sales of its product. The Court finds that this evidence is not necessary in light of the \nother factors.  Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 16 of 19 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   \n• The record is replete with evidence of , and  admissions that,  OpenAI customers \nwere confused by Ravine’s company. (Perahia Decl., Ex. 12, Deposition \nTranscript of Guy Ravine, at 42:13–15) (“Q: When did you first notice that \nconfusion? A: People started -- well, you know, back in 20- -- 2016, even, there was confusion.”); id., Exs. 2, 41; Ravine Decl., ¶ 58.) \n \n• After OpenAI launched Dall -E 2 and ChatGPT, Ravine launched an image \ngenerator (“Boom”) and a chat bot (“Ava.”) ( Compare Ravine Decl. ¶¶ 45–50 with  \nBrockman Decl. ¶ 37.). Similar products present  direct evidence of copying.  \n  \nAccordingly, the Court finds no genuine disputes of material fact that Ravine’s use of Open AI led \nto actual confusion among customers. Nor is there a genuine dispute of material fact that Ravine \ncopied OpenAI. Because Ravine drifted into OpenAI’s market segment through launching Boom \nand Ava—products OpenAI had offered months prior—Ravine is deemed to have copied the mark.  \nSummary. In sum, even v iewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ravine, the \nCourt concludes that OpenAI acquir ed secondary meaning by at least November 2022. By using the \nOpen AI mark for Boom and Ava after that point, Ravine infringed OpenAI ’s trademark.  \nAccordingly, the Court G\nRANTS  OpenAI’s motion for summary judgment as to its claims \nfor trademark infringement (claims 1 and 2) and Ravine’s remaining counterclaims (4, 5, and 7).9 \nIV. MOTION TO STRIKE  \n Ravine moved to strike “new” evidence and arguments asserted in OpenAI ’s reply, along \nwith counsel’s evidentiary objections. (Dkt. No. 290.) In response, OpenAI moved to strike \nRavine’s motion to strike as an unauthorized sur-reply. (Dkt. No. 294.) The Court finds that \nOpenAI’s reply evidence was properly submitted in response to Ravine’s  opposition. The Court, \nhowever, will strike OpenAI’s evidentiary objections inasmuch as those objections violate Civil Local Rule 7- 3(a). (“Any evidentiary and procedural objections to the motion must be contained \nwithin the brief or memorandum.”)  The Court will consider OpenAI’s evidentiary objections only \nif those objections were asserted in the parties’ briefing or at oral argument. In any event, the Court \nonly considers admissible evidence. \n \n \n9 In light of the Court’s finding, it need not decide whether secondary meaning was \nestablished among a narrower segment by January 2017. Case 4:23-cv-03918-YGR     Document 326     Filed 07/21/25     Page 17 of 19 \n18 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Accordingly, t he Court  GRANTS IN PART Ravine ’s motion to strike, and D ENIES  OpenAI ’s \nmotion to strike.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \n For the reasons set forth above, the Court G RANT S plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment \nin full , GRANTS IN PART defendants’ motion to strike, and  DENIES  plaintiff’s  motion to strike.    \n THE COURT ORDERS AS FOLLOWS :  \n The Court permanently enjoins defendants from using the Open AI mark.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of Moomaw v. GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd, the plaintiffs allege that GeoSnap violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting and using facial geometry biometrics without consent. The court denied GeoSnap's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, as GeoSnap utilized its AI-driven photo platform, which facilitated the extraction of facial biometrics from photos, to engage in commerce with Illinois residents through events such as Tough Mudder.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue is whether the court has personal jurisdiction over GeoSnap, an Australian company, due to its business activities involving the collection of biometric data from Illinois residents via its AI-oriented photo platform.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that it has personal jurisdiction over GeoSnap because it purposefully directed its activities at Illinois through its online platform, which facilitated biometric data collection of Illinois residents. The court found GeoSnap's engagements, such as partnerships with events in Illinois and the use of facial recognition AI, constituted purposeful availment of Illinois' market.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation:** Imagine a company in Australia that helps people find photos of themselves at fun events using computer programs that recognize faces (like what your phone does with selfies, but more advanced). Some people in Illinois used this service without seeing a message that says their face info would be stored and used. When these people got mad and took the company to court, claiming this wasn’t allowed, the company tried to say the court wasn't the boss of them because they're in another country. But since the company did business with people right here, the judge said, \"Nope, you played in this sandbox, so our rules apply!\"",

(Doc. 38).\n2  \n1 Defendants removed this action from the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, Illinois pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1332, 1441, 1446, and 1453 .\n2 On April 12, 2024, GeoSnap and former defendant GeoSnapShot Inc. moved to reconsider the Court’s \nOrder denying its Motion to Dismiss or, alternatively, to Modify the Order to Make it Appealable. \nThereafter, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Comp laint. The First Amended Complaint dropped \nGeoSnapShot Inc as a defendant and added Sarah Gustafson as a plaintiff. (Doc. 58). As a result, the Court \ndenied the initial motion to reconsider as moot. (Doc. 59). The Court then granted GeoSnap’s motion Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 1 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>2 \n I. JURISDICTIONAL FACTS \nA. Overview \nGeoSnap created and owns and operates an  online photo platform on a globally \naccessible website: www.GeoSnap.com  (“Website”). (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). Photographers who \nregister with GeoSnap (“Photographers”) can us e the Website to upload photos they take \nat events (and in some instances, license to Website users). (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5).  Website users \ncan use the Website to search for, view, download (and in some cases, purchase licenses \nto) the photos. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5).  \nGeoSnap’s business model is dependent on its collection and use of the biometrics \nof the people depicted in its online photo platform. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). GeoSnap encourages \nevent participants to find photos of themselves by uploading a “selfie” and allowing its \nartificial intelligence to compare that photo with the others in its database. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). \nThis can only be done by extracting fr om each photo data representing the unique \ngeometry of each facial image so that comparisons can be made. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). Under \nBIPA, “scan[s] of . . . face geometry” are biometrics, 740 ILCS 14/10 . Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs argue, GeoSnap cannot collect or use such scans unless it complies with BIPA.  \nIn April 2019, GeoSnap contracted with Tough Mudder, an endurance event \ncompany, to allow Photographers to attend and take photographs of participants in \n \nseeking an extension of time to respond to the Amended Complaint to allow GeoSnap to provide time to \ninvestigate the additional plaintiff’s claims. (Docs. 60 and 61). On August 21, 2024, GeoSnap filed the instant \nmotion indicating that Gustafson’s claims are substantially similar to those raised by the original plaintiffs \nand do not impact the personal jurisdic tion arguments previously raised.  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 2 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>3 \n Tough Mudder events. (Doc. 58 ¶ 34). On August 24, 2019, Plaintiffs Adam and Regan \nMoomaw attended the “Tou gh Mudder Chicago Saturday” event held in Rockford, \nIllinois. (Doc. 58 ¶ 40). Plaintiff Sarah Gustafson attended Tough Mudder events held in \nRockford Illinois, in 2019, 2021, and 2022. (Doc. 58 ¶ 46). Thereafter, Plaintiffs used \nGeoSnap’s Website to locate pictures of themselves participating in the event. Plaintiffs \n“purchased” complimentary licenses to those photographs and downloaded the same, \nreceiving a receipt from GeoSnap.   \nB. GeoSnap \nGeoSnap is a proprietary limited company under the laws of Australia and is \nbased in Sydney, Australia. (Doc. 58 ¶ 10; Doc. 26-1 ¶¶ 2-3). GeoSnap does not maintain \na place of business in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnap does not employ anyone in Illinois. \n(Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnap does not own, lease, or occupy any property in Illinois, and it \ndoes not own any investments in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnap employs seven full-time employees, and none of those employees are based in Illinois. GeoSnap’s Website is \nnot hosted in Illinois and GeoSnap does not process photographs in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ \n3; Doc. 27 p. 3).  \nC. GeoSnap Website  \nGeoSnap.com is a globally accessible website created and owned and operated by \nGeoSnap. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5).

(Doc. 58 ¶ 4; Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). GeoSnap markets its platform  to both event \norganizers and photographers. (Doc. 58 ¶ 21).  \nD. Photographers3  \nPhotographers must register to use the Website. (Doc. 27-1 §§ 3, 4.1). Once \nregistered, Photographers may utilize GeoSnap’s Website services which include \n“[GeoSnap’s] event calendar, [GeoSnap’s] business name, [GeoSnap’s] relationship with \nevent organizers,” and “other Site services.” (Doc. 27-1, §§ 8.1, 8.3). Additionally, once \nregistered, Photographers may upload photos to the Website. (Doc. 27-1 § 8.3). For \nPhotographers to be able to upload photos, an “event organizer” (who is not a GeoSnap \nemployee) first must create an event on the Website. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 7). Alternatively, if an \nevent has not been created, Photographers may create the event themselves and invite \nother Photographers to attend the event. (Doc. 27-1, pg. 10 § 8.4).  \nPhotographers agree to GeoSnap’s Terms and Conditions by (1) registering for the \nWebsite (Doc. 27-1 § 4.1.5); (2) accessing the Website, using the Website, or using any \nservices available on the Website; (Doc. 27-1, § 1); (3) uploading  photos to the Website \n(Doc. 27-1 § § 4.2.10, 4.3); and (4) selling photos on the Website (Doc. 27-1 §§ 1, 4).  The \nTerms and Conditions also st ate that Photographers must read, understand, and agree to \nthe Terms and Conditions before selling photos on or using the Website. (Doc. 27-1, pg. \n2).  \n \n3 GeoSnap’s Terms and Conditions also refer to Photographers as “Sellers.” (Doc. 27-1).

GeoSnap Terms and Conditions \nPursuant to the Terms and Conditions, photographers agree to the following:  \n4.3 Use of the Content and Grant of License \nBy uploading Media Material to the Site the Seller has accepted these Terms \nand Conditions and agrees to  the following conditions:  \n 4.3.1. The Site and the Company will use your Media Material for the \npurpose of licensing your Media Material to customers of the Site in such formats as we may, from time to time make available to Customers, \nincluding without limiting the generality of the foregoing, via electronic \ndownload; \n 4.3.2. In connection with the foregoing, in addition to the licenses \nyou grant to the Site elsewhere in these Terms and Conditions, you grant to \nthe Site and the Company a non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, \nworldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, publish, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute copies of your Media Material; \n 4.3.3. The license includes the right for the Site to use screen \nresolution images and thumbnails of your Media Material for display and promotional purposes on the Site and any third-party sites, and in \nconnection with internet search results, and embeddable codes;  \n 4.3.4. Media Material will be licensed to customers by the Site in \naccordance with the Site Terms and Conditions in effect at the time. \n(Doc. 27-1 pp. 6-7).  \n8. Usage of the Site \n8.1. Sellers may have alternative photography business/brands that \nthey use. The Site supports the sellers ri ght for Sellers to carry on their own \nphotography businesses, however we do not allow you to use the Site services (our event calendar, our business name, our brand, our relationship with other photographers, our relationship with event \norganizers, or any other Site services) to compete with the Site or any \nservices that the Site provides.

Many of the events on the Sites calendar of events are non-\nexclusive, there may be non-GeoSnap ph otographers at the event. If you \nbook onto a GeoSnap event you are deemed to be representing GeoSnap at \nthat event and you must upload photos  to the GeoSnap platform for sale. \nYou may not advertise that photos from a GeoSnap event are for sale through any other platform or service other than the Site. \n8.3. To upload photos to an event on the GeoSnap calendar you must \nbe a registered photographer for that event. The number of photographers who can upload from an event is determined by the event organizer. \n8.4. If the event is not on the Sites calendar you can create the event \non GeoSnap yourself. You can be a seller at that event and request other \nSellers (through the GeoSnap platform) to attend your event and upload \nphotos for sale if you choose. \n8.5. The Site events calendar is for the use of Sellers and is a service \nprovided by the Site for its Sellers and Users. The calendar information is \nto be used solely by Sellers to register onto and attend events as a GeoSnap photographer. The Site calendar should not be used for any other purpose \nincluding, but not limited to; finding events to attend as a non-GeoSnap \nphotographer. The Site calendar should not be used for any other purpose including, but not limited to; finding events to attend as a non-GeoSnap \nphotographer, passing calendar information to a different company, \ncopying, duplicating, linking to, redirecting to or otherwise using the \ninformation for any other purpose.  \n8.6. If you attend a GeoSnap event you cannot offer an alternative \npurchasing option for photos other than the Site. You cannot advertise your \nown website or other place to purchase the photos from the GeoSnap event \nother than the Site. \n8.7. Any photographer who has breached or is deemed by GeoSnap \nto have breached these terms may have their phot ographer account \nsuspended or terminated immediately at the sole discretion of GeoSnap \ninline with the “Termination” clause. \n8.8. Some Events and Event Organizers may require you to have a \nWorking with Children Check (WWCC) or similar document determined \nby your country or state to prove that you are certified to be working \naround minors). If you book on to an event that requires a WWC then you \nmust ensure that you have a valid WWCC, that it is up-to-date and present \na copy to the event organizer upon arrival at the event.

You may not alter the purchased Media material in any way; \n \n4 When photos are licensed through the Website, GeoSnap receives 30% of the proceeds. (Doc. 58 ¶ 25).  \n \n5 Initially, photos are only viewable in a lower quality or format to that of the original photo. (Doc. 27-1 p. \n3). The original content is only accessible after the buyer successfully purchases or licenses the photos. (Doc. \n27-1 p. 3).  \n Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 7 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>8 \n 6.1.3. That agreement states that the Seller of the Media Material \nowns the exclusive world-wide copyright and the Media Material. \n6.1.4.

GeoSnap and Tough Mudder  \nIn 2019, GeoSnap contracted with Tough Mudder for Photographers to attend and \ntake photographs of participants in Tough Mudder events. (Doc. 58 ¶ 34). Tough Mudder \npromotes endurance events where participants  attempt 10-to-12-m ile-long obstacle \ncourses that feature hazards such as fields of mud and tanks of cold water. (Doc. 58 ¶ 35). \nIn an article promoting the partnership between GeoSnap and Tough Mudder, GeoSnap \nfounder and chief executive Andy Edwards (“Edwards”) emphasized that GeoSnap’s \nbiometric-based Selfie Search feature was central to the agreement. (Doc. 58 ¶ 37). As Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 8 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>9 \n Edwards stated in the article, because Tough Mudder participants “come out from the \nmuddy depths, face recognition is the only thing that will find photos of them.” (Doc. 58 \n¶ 37). In the same article, Edwards touted that the Tough Mudde r partnership would \nhelp GeoSnap realize “500% growth” in 2019. (Doc. 58 ¶ 38). Between August 2019 and \nDecember 2022, GeoSnap’s Website has hosted thousands of photographs from at least \neleven Tough Mudder events located in Illinois. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 52, 53).  \nG. Plaintiffs  \nOn August 24, 2019, Plaintiffs Adam and Regan Moomaw attended the “Tough \nMudder Chicago Saturday” event held in Rockford, Illinois. (Doc. 58 ¶ 40). At the event, \nphotographers took photographs of Plaintif fs and uploaded them to GeoSnap. (Doc. 58 \n¶¶ 42-43). During the upload process, GeoSnap extracted facial biometrics from the \nphotographs. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 41-42). The Moomaws were never informed that GeoSnap \nwould collect, store, or use their biometrics in the form of data representing the unique geometry of their facial im ages or that GeoSnap would profit from the use of their \nbiometrics by using them to enable the Selfie Search feature that facilitates the sale of \nphotographs through the Website. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 43-44). Regan  Moomaw later used the \nGeoSnap website to “purchase” and download complimentary licenses to the \nphotographs and was issued a receipt from GeoSnap (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 13, Doc. 27 p. 2). The \nreceipt confirmed that each photograph was from the “Tough Mudder Chicago \nSaturday” event. (Doc. 27-2).  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 9 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>10 \n Plaintiff Sarah Gustafson attended Tough Mudder events held in Rockford, \nIllinois, in 2019, 2021, and 2022. (Doc. 58, pg. 10). During the events, one or more \nphotographs containing Gustafson’s facial image were taken and subsequently uploaded \nto the GeoSnap website. ( Id.). Gustafson was never informed that GeoSnap would collect, \nstore, or use their biometrics in the form of  data representing the unique geometry of \ntheir facial images or that GeoSnap would pr ofit from the use of their biometrics by using \nthem to enable the Selfie Search feature that facilitates the sale of photographs through \nthe Website. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 49-50).  \nII. Personal Jurisdiction Order \nOn March 7, 2024, this Court found that it has personal jurisdiction over GeoSnap. \n(Doc. 38). The Court found, in pertinent part, specific jurisdiction exists because \nGeoSnap’s Website structured its commercial activity to invite business from Illinois. \nFurther, as the owner and operator of such a Website, GeoSnap stood “ready and willing” to do business with Illinois residents and then knowingly did business with Illinois \nresidents. The Court also found ample eviden ce demonstrating that GeoSnap reasonably \nshould have foreseen that it would be licensing, and in some cases selling, photographs \nfrom its online photo platform to Illinois residents such as the Plaintiffs.  \nThe Court rejected the contention that GeoS nap is merely a technology vendor and \nthat any contacts it has with Illinois are the result of a third party’s conduct and/or a \nWebsite user’s unilateral conduct. In so holding, the Court noted that, unlike the cases \nrelied on by GeoSnap, GeoSnap “was not merely involved in a one-off transaction with a \nthird party who, without GeoSnap’s knowledge, utilized GeoSnap’s technology in Illinois Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 10 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>11 \n for its own purposes.” (Doc. 38, pg. 15). Instead, “GeoSnap created and operated a self-\nhosted interactive website and allowed user s, including Illinois users, to engage in \ncommerce on that website. ( Id.). The Court also found GeoSnap’s contacts with Illinois \nwere the result of decisions made by GeoSnap, and that the contacts demonstrated \nGeoSnap “purposely exploited the Illinois market in a way that it should have reasonably \nforeseen its technology being used by, and its photographs being licensed to, Illinois \nresidents.” (Doc. 38, pgs. 17-18).  \nThe Court also considered the relationshi p between GeoSnap and Photographers \nattending Tough Mudder events as a basis for personal jurisdiction. The Court found that \nGeoSnap’s Terms and Conditio ns demonstrate the Photographers were acting as \nGeoSnap’s agents when they photographed events in Illinois and that the Photographers’ \nphysical presence in Illinois was attributable to GeoSnap. (Doc. 38, pg. 20). Accordingly, \nthe Court explained, the relationship between GeoSnap and the Photographers provided \nan alternative basis for establishing purposeful availment. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b)  \nA court may reconsider an interlocutory order under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 54(b) . The Rule provides that any order that  does not resolve all claims as to \nall parties “may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the \nclaims and all the parties’ rights and liabilities.” F e d .  R .  C i v .  P .  5 4 ( b ) . Motions for \nreconsideration serve a limited function and are only granted where “the court has \npatently misunderstood a party or has made a decision outside the adversarial issues Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 11 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>12 \n presented to the Court by the parties or has made an error not of reasoning but of \napprehension.” Bank of Waunakee v. Rochester Cheese Sales, Inc.,  906 F.2d 1185, 1191 (7th Cir. \n1990) . “Such problems rarely arise and the motion to reconsider should be equally rare.” \nId.  \nThe purpose of allowing motions to reconsider is not “to enable a party to \ncomplete presenting his case after the court has ruled against him. Were such a procedure \nto be countenanced, some lawsuits really mi ght never end, rather than just seeming \nendless.” Frietsch v. Refco Inc ., 56 F.3d 825, 828 (7th Cir. 1995)  (refusing to consider \nargument that a party did not raise until after the court had dismissed the suit).  \nAdditionally, reconsideration “is not an approp riate forum for rehashing previously rejected \narguments.” Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole v. CBI Indus., Inc ., 90 F.3d 1264,  1270 (7th Cir. \n1996).  \nB. Personal Jurisdiction \n While there are two forms of jurisdiction, only specific jurisdiction is at issue here. \n“Specific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of issues deriving from, or connected \nwith, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.” Id. (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted). Specific jurisdiction “may be condensed to three essential \nrequirements....” Felland v. Clifton , 682 F.3d 665, 673 (7th Cir. 2012) . First, the defendant's \ncontacts with the forum state must show th at it “purposefully availed [itself] of the \nprivilege of conducting business in the forum stat e or purposefully directed [its] activities \nat the state.” Id. (citation omitted). Second, the plaintiff's alleged injury must have arisen \nout of the defendant's forum-related activities. Id. Third, any exercise of personal Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 12 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>13 \n jurisdiction must “comport with traditio nal notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.” Id. (citations omitted). Here, GeoSnap ch allenges the Court’s finding at to the \nfirst element – purposeful availment.  \nIV.   DISCUSSION \nA. Purposeful Availment \n1. Purposeful Contacts Between GeoSnap and Illinois \n \nGeoSnap contends the Court erred in find ing that GeoSnap purposefully directed \nany activities toward Illinois. In support of this argument, GeoSnap argues the Court’s \nreliance on NBA Props., Inc. v. Hanwjh , 46 F.4th 614 (7th Cir. 2022)  (“NBA Properties ”) and \nCurry v. Revolution Labs., LLC ,, 949 F.3d 385, 399 (7th Cir. 2020)  (“Curry ”) was improper \nbecause these cases are factually dist inguishable from the instant case.  \nAccording to GeoSnap, Curry  is distinguishable because GeoSnap (1) did not ship \na physical product to Illinois, (2) had no way of knowing where Tough Mudder events \nwould occur, (3) had no control over where Tough Mudder events would take place, and \n(4) had no reason to know individuals attending Tough Mudder events in Illinois resided \nin Illinois. (Doc. 63, pgs. 6-7). GeoSnap raised these arguments in connection with its \noriginal motion to dismiss for lack of pers onal jurisdiction. (Doc. 33, pg. 4, arguing that \nCurry is “easily distinguishable because GeoSnap has no control over where the Tough \nMudder events would occur, does not use shipping addresses in Illinois, does not actually \ndeliver any ‘product’ in Illinois, and does not provide to [sic] a written acknowledgement \nto any Illinois consumers.”). Nonetheless, GeoSnap contends, it is proper to reassert the Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 13 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>14 same arguments in a motion to rec onsider because they were “mi stakenly overlooke d” \nby th e Court. (Doc. 63, pg. 7).  \nThe Court did not overlook these arguments; the y were discussed in the Original \nPJ Order (Doc. 38, pgs. 14-18), but consideration of additional jurisdictional facts led the \nCourt to conclude that GeoSnap reasonably should have foreseen tha t it would \nbe licensing (a nd in some ca ses selling)  photographs f rom its onlin e photo platform to \nIllinois residents. (Id.). GeoSnap may not n ow invoke Rule 54(b) to revisit a rguments \nthat have been pre viously raised and rejected. Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole v. CBI \nIndus., Inc., 90 F.3d 1264, 1270 (7th Cir. 1996) (“Reconsideration is not an \nappropriate forum for r ehashing previously rejected a rguments...”).  \nGeoSnap’s attempt to distinguish NBA Properties is also imprope r in the context of \na Rule 54(b)  motion.  Plai ntiffs’ response to GeoSnap’s original personal jurisdiction \nmotion extensi vely discusse d NBA Properties . (Doc. 27, pgs. 11-18). GeoSnap could have \npresented argume nt regarding NBA Properties  in its reply brief but chose not to. GeoSna p \ncannot now, for the first ti me in a motion for reconsideration, “raise arguments which \ncould, and should, have been made before [the order be ing challenged] issued.” FDIC v. \nMeyer , 781 F.2d 1260, 1268 (7th Cir. 1986) .  \nThe Court therefore rejects Ge oSnap’s ar guments regarding Curry  and NBA \nProp erties as being improperly raised in a motion to reconsider. That being said, \nGeoSnap’s rehashed arguments regarding Curry and be lated arguments regarding NBA \nProperties  fall flat. As the Court previously explai ned, “ [t]here is no per se requirement \nthat the defendant espe cially target the  forum in its business activity; it is sufficien t that Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 14 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>15 the defendant reasonably could foresee that its product would be sold in the forum. Curry \nv. Revolution Lab'ys, LLC, 949 F.3d 385, 399 (7th Cir. 2020) . Likewise, the claim that\nGeoSnap did not know each user’s address does not defeat personal jurisdiction because, \nat a minimum, Given GeoSnap’s purposeful busine ss activity, it has reason to know that \nit would be transacting business with individuals in Illinois.  \nGeoSnap contracted with Tough Mudder, an entity that has a market presence \nboth nationally and world-wide, including in Illinois, to provide its product – the online \nphoto array – to athletes attending Tough Mudd er events. GeoSnap held itself out as open \nfor business in Illinois by allowing photographers attending Tough Mudder events, including events in Illinois, to invite attendee s to use GeoSnap’s Website to license or \npurchase photographs from GeoSnap’s online photo array – in fact, participating photographers were prohibited from distributing event photographs on any other forum. \nThe photographs available on GeoSnap’s Webs ite were grouped by the date and location \nof the Tough Mudder event. For example, GeoSnap’s Website hosted over 22,000 photographs from an event identified as  “Tough Mudder Chicago 2022 Saturday.” When \na customer purchases or licenses a photograph hosted on GeoSnap’s Website, the receipt \nspecifies the date and locati on of the event where the phot ograph was taken. Given these \nfacts, GeoSnap can hardly complain it did not know some of its photographs would be licensed or purchased by Illinois residents. Therefore, it can be said that GeoSnap \nreasonably anticipated it would be licensing or selling its product to Illinois residents, \nsuch that GeoSnap purposefully availed itself of the benefits of doing business in Illinois. Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 15 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>16 The fact that a physical product was not shipped to Illinois does not alter the \nCourt’s analysis. See uBID, In c. v. GoDaddy Grp., Inc ., 623 F.3d 421, 429 (7th Cir.  2010) (fact \nthat physical product was not shipped to the forum does not defeat personal jurisdiction \nwhen contacts are otherwise sufficient). Nor does  the fact that GeoSnap did not charge \nfor licensing Tough Mudder photographs. Like the defendant in Howell v. Bumble, Inc., \nNo. 21 CV 6898, 2023 WL 6126492 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 19, 2023) , the aim of GeoSnap’s \npartnership with Tough Mudder was not to generate revenue from licensing photographs at Tough Mudder events, but to increase the company’s market share by \ngaining users who might eventually become paying customers. See Id. at *9-10 (finding \npersonal jurisdiction even though defendant di d not sell or ship products to the forum \nstate and noting that the defendant’s goal was to “gain users, preferably those who pay \nfor premium features…” and to “solicit ongoing use” of defendant’s dating app). \nThe Court also is not convinced by the co ntention that GeoSnap’s hosting of over \n22,000 photographs from a 2022 Illinois event is irrelevant because the Moomaw’s claims \narise from an event held in Illinois in 201 9. First, this argument was not raised in \nGeoSnap’s original motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and has been \nwaived. See Terese 396 F.Supp. 3d at 794. Second, the record reflects that the Website hosts \nphotos taken from eleven other Illinois ev ents, including the 2019 event the Moomaws \nattended. (Doc. 58, ¶ 52). Third, the Seventh Circuit has held that contacts arising after a \ncause of action accrues are relevant to the personal jurisdiction analysis. See \nLogan Prods., Inc. v. Optibase, Inc.,  103 F.3d 49, 53 (7th Cir. 1996) ; Dehmlow v. Austin  \nFireworks , 963 F.2d 941, 948 n.6 (7th Cir. 1992) .  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 16 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>17 \n Finally, GeoSnap contends the Court “overlooked” three cases cited in GeoSnap’s \nunderlying briefing: (1) Stein v. Clarifai , 526 F.Supp.3d 339 (N.D. Ill 2021) , Gutierrez v. \nWemagine.ai LLP , 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14831 (N.D. Ill. 2022), and Webber v. Armslist LLC , \n70 F.4th 945 (7th Cir. 2023). But the fact that the Court did not expressly address every \nsingle case cited in GeoSnap’s initial briefing do es not mean those cases were overlooked. \nThe Court was not required to specifically address in its opinion each and every \nargument asserted by GeoSnap. In denying  GeoSnap’s motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction, the Court implicitly rejected GeoSnap’s arguments pertaining to \nthese decisions. Moreover, as highlighted in Plaintiffs’ briefing, Stein and Gutierrez are \ndistinguishable and not controlling. And, Webber is inapposite. GeoSnap contends that in \nWebber , the Seventh Circuit held that “designing a website that could be used in the forum \nstate” and “solict[ing] business in that state” is insufficient to create jurisdiction.” (Doc. \n63, pg. 9). Not so. As noted by Plaintiff, in Webber the issue was not whether the \ndefendant’s commercial website targeted the forum state, but whether the website’s \ncontacts with the forum could be attributed  to the website’s designer, a natural person \nsued individually.  \nIn summary, GeoSnap’s contacts clearly signal a willingness to do business with \nIllinois and indicate that GeoSnap reasonably should have anticipated that some of its \nphotographs would be licensed or purchased by Illinois consumers. GeoSnap’s \narguments on reconsideration are unavailing, and the Court finds sufficient contacts to \nsupport an exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over GeoSnap.  \n2. Relationship Between GeoSnap and the Photographers Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 17 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>24 \n GeoSnap, as the party seeking interlocuto ry review, bears the heavy burden of \npersuading the Court that “exceptional circu mstances justify a departure from the basic \npolicy of postponing appellate review until after the entry of a final judgment.”  Coopers \nv. Lybrand v. Livesay , 437 U.S. 463, 475 (1978) . The Seventh Circuit has cautioned that § \n1292(b)  must be used sparingly “lest interlocutory review increase the time and expense \nrequired for litigation,” Asher v. Baxter Int'l., Inc. , 505 F.3d 736, 741 (7th Cir. 2007) , and \nthat interlocutory appeals are “frowned  on in the federal judicial system,” Sterk v. Redbox \nAutomated Retail , LLC, 672 F.3d 535, 536 (7th Cir. 2012) .  \nAs noted above, to certify an order for interlocutory appeal under § 1292(b)  there \nmust be “a question of law, it must be controlling , it must be contestable , and its resolution \nmust promise to speed up  the litigation.” Ahrenholz v. Bd. Of Trs.,  219 F.3d 674, 675 (7th \nCir. 2000)  (emphasis in original). The criteria are “conjunctive, not disjunctive,” therefore, \nthe Court should not grant a motion to certify if the movant does not meet its burden as \nto any one of these criteria. Id. at 676 .  \nGeoSnap contends that requirements under § 1292 are met. Specifically, GeoSnap \ncontends that personal jurisdiction is a qu estion of law that has the potential to be \ndispositive and is therefore a controlling question of law. GeoSnap further contends that, \ngiven the facts of this case, whether personal jurisdiction exists is contestable and \nresolution of the question in GeoSnap’s favor could prevent protracted litigation.  \nHere, the Court’s analysis begins and ends with section 1292(b)’s first requirement. \nTo be a “question of law” as used in section 1292(b), the question must be a “pure” \nquestion of law, “something the court of appeals could decide quickly and cleanly Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 24 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>25 \n without having to study the record,” such as “a question of the meaning of a statutory or \nconstitutional provision, regulation, or common law doctrine ...” Id. at 676–\n677. Application of a legal standard is a question of law. In re Text Messaging Antitrust \nLitigation,  630 F.3d at 626 . However, the determination here does not involve a pure \nquestion of law. Instead, it involves mixed questions of law and fact concerning \nGeoSnap’s conduct and its contacts with Illinois.  \nGeoSnap insists this case involves a pure question of law because GeoSnap “is \narguing that the Court’s legal conclusions drawn from the facts in the record were \nincorrect and contrary to well-established precedent from this Circuit.” (Doc. 63, pg. 17). \nGeoSnap further argues that this Court’s opin ion is at odds with other district court \nopinions that “declined personal jurisdiction and are closer to the facts in this case than \n[the facts in] the cases cited by the Court. GeoSnap’s supplemental briefing further details \nhow the facts of this case are similar to other cases where personal jurisdiction has been \ndeclined and dissimilar to other cases where courts found that the exercise of personal \njurisdiction was proper. (Doc. 75).  \nBut these arguments only serve to demons trate that GeoSnap’s alleged question of \nlaw is inextricably intertwined with an analysis of the factual allegations in this case. The \ndetermination here necessarily requires examination of the facts. Indeed, resolving \nGeoSnap’s initial motion to dismiss and its subsequent motion for reconsideration, \nrequired an extensive review of the relevant jurisdictional facts. The same will be true for \nthe Seventh Circuit; determining whether GeoSnap’s contacts with Illinois are sufficient \nto establish personal jurisdiction will necessarily require the Appellate Court to dig Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 25 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>26 \n through the record, re viewing facts, Terms and Conditions, and declarations. See e.g.,  \nShepherd Investments Int'l, Ltd. v. Verizon Commc'ns, Inc. , No. 03C0703, 2005 WL 1475323, \nat *2 (E.D. Wisc. June 22, 2005)  (finding that review of person al jurisdiction order did not \ninvolve an abstract legal issue because the court of appeals would have to “study the \nrecord, decide which facts were relevant and measure the facts against a somewhat \nimprecise legal standard, that of minimum contacts.”); Burton v. American Cyanamid , Case \nNo. 07-CV-0303, 2016 WL 311286, at *3 (E.D. Wis. Jan. 26, 2016)  (finding that “the \npurposeful availment inquiry requires the application of facts to a legal standard and \nthus is not a pure question of law.”).  \nUnder these circumstances, GeoSnap cannot meet the standard for a “question of \nlaw” ripe for appellate review under § 1292. Because all four criteria must be satisfied in \norder to certify an order for immediate appeal under § 1292(b) , and at least one is not \nsatisfied, the Court need not address the remaining criteria. See Ahrenholz , 219 F.3d at 675 . \n2. Jurisdictional Discovery \nIn support of its argument for jurisdictional discovery, GeoSnap first contends the \nCourt erred by “prioritize[ing] inferences it drew from GeoSnap’s Te rms and Conditions \nover GeoSnap’s Declaration.” (Doc. 63, pg. 17). But, on a motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction, district courts must resolve all factual disputes in plaintiff’s favor; \nonly unrefuted facts in a defendant’s declaration will be taken as true.  Northern Grain \nMarketing, LLC v. Greving,  743 F.3d 487, 491 (7th Cir.2014) ; GCIU-Emp. Ret. Fund v . \nGoldfarb Corp.,  565 F.3d 1018, 1020  n. 1 (7th Cir. 2009). Thus, to the extent there is a dispute \nbetween GeoSnap’s declaration and the Terms and Conditions (the affirmative evidence Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 26 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>27 \n supporting the exercise of jurisdiction), the Court properly resolved that dispute in \nPlaintiff’s favor.  \nNext, GeoSnap criticizes the Court for noting that “the declaration of the parties is \nnot controlling where the conduct of the partie s demonstrates the existence of an agency \nrelationship.” (Doc. 38, pg. 20 n.14) (citing McNerney v. Allamuradov, 84 N.E.3d 437, 454 \n(Ill. App. Ct. 2017) . GeoSnap contends that, at this ea rly stage and without the presence \nof a counter-declaration, it was improper to rely on this case because McNerney  was \ndecided on summary judgment on a more fully developed record. GeoSnap misconstrues \nthe Court’s Order. The Court’s citation to McNerney is not intended to refer to a \n“declaration” under 28 U.S.C. § 1746 . Rather, the Court was emphasizing that, if the \nconduct of the parties demonstrates an agency relationship, the fact that the parties’ \ncontract disavowed an agency relationship by “declaring” no such relationship exists is \nnot determinative.  \nFinally, GeoSnap’s citation to B.D. ex rel. Myer v. Samsung SDI Co., 91 F.4th 856, 859 \n(7th Cir. 2024) for the proposition that the Court erred in denying the motion to dismiss \nwithout allowing for jurisdictional discovery is unpersuasive. In B.D. , the district court \nrelied primarily on the stream-of-commerce theory to find specific jurisdiction. Id. at 862 . \nThe Seventh Circuit chose to remand the case for jurisdictional discovery because (1) the \nparties agreed that the defendant sold some products, but not the product in issue (18650 \nbatteries), directly to the forum (Indiana), and (2) although the record indicated \ndefendant sold 18650 batteries to Indiana consumers through third-party websites and \nvendors, whether the defendant knew or expected that these third parties would cause Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 27 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>28the product to enter Indiana was uncle ar. Id. at 863. But the same issue i s not present in \nthis case. GeoSnap was not transactin g business with users via a third party,  and thus \nthere is no question rega rding whethe r GeoSnap knew that a third par ty would cause \nits product to enter Illinois. Rather , given GeoSnap’s purposeful conduct (as \npreviously describe d herein), Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that \nspecific personal jurisdiction exists.\nV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves plaintiffs Adam Moomaw, Regan Moomaw, and Sarah Gustafson who filed a class-action lawsuit against GeoSnapShot PTY LTD, alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to the collection and use of their biometric data without proper consent. The case focuses on whether GeoSnapShot, which uses AI to match event participants' photos for sale, can compel arbitration based on waivers signed for Tough Mudder events, where the photos were taken. The court denied GeoSnapShot's motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of contract formation issues and technicalities in the agreements, along with insufficient evidence to demonstrate users agreed to its terms.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether GeoSnapShot, a non-signatory to the liability waiver agreements signed for Tough Mudder events, can compel arbitration or dismissal of the claims based on being a third-party beneficiary to the agreements.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied GeoSnapShot's motion to compel arbitration, finding that GeoSnapShot, as a non-signatory, could not enforce the arbitration clauses within the liability agreements because those clauses did not directly benefit GeoSnapShot or indicate an intent to benefit non-signatories like GeoSnapShot.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: In simple terms, this case is about whether a company, GeoSnap, which scans people's faces in photos using AI, can make the people sue somewhere else or not at all, because they signed a form when they joined a Tough Mudder event. The court said no, because GeoSnap wasn't directly mentioned to benefit from those forms, so the people can continue their lawsuit in this court.",

OVERVIEW \nGeoSnap is an online platform (“Website”) that allows registered photographers \n(“Photographers”) to attend events, upload  their photos to the Website, and receive a \n \n1 Defendants removed this action from the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, Illinois pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1332 , 1441, 1446, and 1453.  \n Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 1 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>2 \n commission (shared with GeoSnap) on the phot os that are sold through the website. (Doc. \n58, ¶ 4).  \nGeoSnap’s business model is dependent on its collection and use of the biometrics \nof the people depicted in its online photo platform. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). GeoSnap encourages \nevent participants to find photos of themselves by uploading a “selfie” and allowing its \nartificial intelligence to compare that photo with the others in its database. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). \nThis can only be done by extracting fr om each photo data representing the unique \ngeometry of each facial image so that comparisons can be made. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). \nIn April 2019, GeoSnap contracted with Tough Mudder, an endurance event \ncompany, to allow Photographers to attend and take photographs of participants in \nTough Mudder events. (Doc. 58 ¶ 34). Tough Mudder promotes endurance events in \nwhich participants attempt 10 to 12 mile-long obstacle courses that feature hazards such \nas fields of mud and tanks of cold water. (Doc. 58 ¶ 35). In an article promoting the \npartnership, GeoSnap founder and chief executive Andy Edwards emphasized that \nGeoSnap’s biometric-based Selfie Search feature was central to the agreement. Because \nTough Mudder participants “come out from  the muddy depths,” the article quoted \nEdwards as saying, “face recognition is the only thing that will find photos of them.” \n(Doc. 58 ¶ 37). In the same article, Edwards touted the Tougher Mudder partnership as \none that would help GeoSnapShot realize “500% growth” in 2019. (Doc. 58 ¶ 38).  \nOn August 24, 2019, Plaintiffs Adam and Regan Moomaw attended the “Tough \nMudder Chicago Saturday” event held in Rockford, Illinois. (Doc. 58 ¶ 40). Plaintiff Sarah \nGustafson attended Tough Mudder events held in Rockford Illinois, in 2019, 2021, and Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 2 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>3 \n 2022. (Doc. 58 ¶ 46). As is relevant to GeoSnap’s arbitration argument, GeoSnap contends \nPlaintiffs executed waiver agreements when they signed up to compete in the Tough \nMudder competitions. (Doc. 62, 62-1).  \nGeoSnap has provided the Court with  copies of five waiver agreements \npurportedly executed by Plaintiffs. Three of the agreements were executed prior to 2021 \n(one each for Adam Moomaw, Regan Moomaw, and Sarah Gustafson relating to the 2019 \nTough Mudder event in Rockford, Illinois) (“Pre-2021 Agreements). (Doc. 62-1). The \nremaining two waiver agreements were executed by Sarah Gustafson in 2021 and 2022 \n(relating to Gustafson’s participation in the 2021 and 2022 Tough Mudder events in \nRockford, Illinois) (“Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements”). (Doc. 62-1). The Pre-2021 \nAgreements include a choice of law provision designating the law “in the State in which \nthe TM Event is held” as controlling, while the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements \ndesignate Delaware law as controlling. (Doc. 62-1).  \nDuring the events, one or more photog raphs containing Plaintif fs’ facial images \nwere taken and subsequently uploaded to the Website. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 41, 47). After the \nphotographs containing Plaintiffs’ facial images were uploaded to the Website, GeoSnap \nscanned them and extracted data representing the unique geometry of Plaintiffs’ facial \nimages. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 42, 48). GeoSnap profited from the use of Plaintiffs’ biometrics by \nusing them to enable the Selfie Search feature that facilitates the sale of photographs \nthrough the Website, and in turn generates GeoSnap’s primary source of revenue. (Doc. \n58 ¶¶ 44, 50).  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 3 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>4 \n Under BIPA, “scan[s] of . . . face geometry” are biometrics, 740 ILCS 14/10 . \nPlaintiffs argue GeoSnap cannot collect or use such scans unless it complies with BIPA. \nPlaintiffs seek statutory liquidated damages for each of several alleged technical \nviolations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/5  et seq.  \nGeoSnap contends that, pursuant to the waiver agreements Plaintiffs purportedly \nexecuted with Tough Mudder, Plaintiffs agreed to “(1) mediation or arbitration for ‘all \ndisputes, controversies or claims arising ou t of [Plaintiffs’] participation of the [Tough \nMudder event…’; and (2) waive the right to proceed as a class action.” (Doc. 62). \nAlthough GeoSnap is a non- signatory to the waiver agreements, it seeks to compel \narbitration based on its alleged third-party beneficiary status. Alternatively, to the extent \nPlaintiffs do not have to arbitrate their claims, GeoSnap seeks to dismiss all or part of \ntheir First Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) . \n(Doc. 62).   \nII. DISCUSSION – MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION \nA. Legal Standard \nThe Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) mandates that courts enforce valid, written \narbitration agreements.  Tinder v. Pinkerton Sec. , 305 F.3d 728, 733 (7th Cir. 2002)  (citing 9 \nU.S.C. § 2). This mandate reflects a federal policy that favors arbitration and “places \narbitration agreements on equal f ooting with all other contracts.” Buckeye Check Cashing, \nInc. v. Cardegna , 546 U.S. 440, 443 (2006) .  Arbitration should be compelled under the FAA \nwhen “three elements are present: (1) an enforceable written agreement to arbitrate, (2) a Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 4 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>5 \n dispute within the scope of the arbitration agreement, and (3) a refusal to arbitrate.”  A.D. \nv. Credit One Bank, N.A. , 885 F.3d 1054, 1060 (7th Cir. 2018)  (citing 9 U.S.C. §§ 3–4).   \nCourts deciding motions to compel arbitration apply \na summary judgment standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 . See Tinder v. \nPinkerton Sec. , 305 F.3d 728, 735 (7th Cir. 2002) . “A district court may conclude as a matter \nof law that parties did or did not enter into an arbitration agreement only if no genuine \ndispute of material fact exists as  to the formation of the agreement.” Wallrich v. Samsung \nElecs. Am., Inc ., 106 F.4th 609, 618 (7th Cir. 2024) . The party seeking to compel arbitration \n“bears the initial burden to show that an arbitration agreement exists.” Id.  \nB. Background  \nPrior to competing in the Tough Mu dder events alleged in the Amended \nComplaint (Doc. 58), Plaintiffs were required to execute a liability agreement. As \npreviously noted, Adam Moomaw, Regan Moomaw, and Sarah Gustafson purportedly executed liability agreements prior to attending the 2019 Tough Mudder event in \nRockford, Illinois (Pre-2021 Agreements”). (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 8-31). In addition, Sarah \nGustafson purportedly executed two liability agreements prior to attending the 2021 and \n2022 Tough Mudder events in Rockford, Illinois (“Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements”). \n(Doc. 62-1, pgs. 32-43).   \nAll five liability agreements include an arbitration provision wherein Plaintiffs \nagreed to (1) mediation or arbitration for, “all disputes, controversies or claims arising \nout of [Plaintiffs’] participation of the [Tough Mudder] event…”; and (2) waive the right \nto proceed as a class action. (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 10, 18, 25, 34, 40). The Pre-2021 Agreements Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 5 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>6 \n include a choice of law provision providing for application of the law “in the State in \nwhich the TM Event is held.” (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 10, 18, 26). The Gustafson 2021/2022 \nAgreements include a choice of law provision providing for the application of Delaware \nlaw. (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 34, 40). GeoSnap admits th at it is a non-signatory to the liability \nagreements but claims that, as a third-party be neficiary, it may enforce the arbitration \nprovisions contained therein.   \nC. Analysis  \n Plaintiffs dispute that they contracted to arbitrate claims with GeoSnap. Thus, \nbefore determining whether the arbitration provisions apply to Plaintiffs’ claims or \nwhether that very question itself is delegat ed to the arbitrator, the Court must first \ndetermine whether a valid contract exists. Ge oSnap contends that an arbitrator, not the \nCourt, must decide whether such an agreem ent exists. GeoSnap’s view is mistaken; it \nconflates the question of contract formation wi th the question of co ntract enforceability.  \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained recently in K.F.C. v. Snap, Inc. , “judges must \ndecide that a contract has been formed before they may order \narbitration.” K.F.C. v. Snap Inc. , 29 F.4th 835, 837 (7th Cir. 2022) ; accord  Janiga v. Questar \nCap. Corp. , 615 F.3d 735, 742 (7th Cir. 2010)  (“The court must decide whether a contract \nexists before it decides wh ether to stay an action and order arbitration.”). This is \nbecause, “[e]ven the most sweeping delegation cannot send the contract- formation  issue \nto the arbitrator, because, until the court rule s that a contract exists, there is simply no \nagreement to arbitrate.” K.F.C. , 29 F.4th at 837  (emphasis added). Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 6 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>7 \n The Court further finds that, whether GeoSnap, a non-signatory to the liability \nagreements, can compel arbitration is a question of contract formation, which must be \ndecided by the Court. See, e.g., CCC Info. Servs. Inc. v. Tractable Inc. , 2019 WL 2011092 at \n*2 (N.D. Ill. May 7, 2019)  (whether a non-signatory defend ant could enforce an arbitration \nagreement was a question of contract formation that must be decided by the Court \nbecause it pertained to whether an agreement “exist[ed] at all”), aff'd, 36 F.4th 721 (7th \nCir. 2022) . Cf. K.F.C.  29 F.4th at 838 (because Illinois law treats contracts entered into by \nchildren as voidable rather than void, argument that it would be against public policy to \nenforce arbitration agreement against non- signatory minor concerned the agreement’s \n“validity, not its existence,” and was therefore a question for the arbitrator). Thus, in the \ninstant case, the Court finds that whether Ge oSnap, as a non-signatory, can enforce the \nsubject arbitration agreements is  a question of contract formation that must be decided \nby the Court.  \nNext, the Court must determine what body of law governs whether a contract \nexists. To the extent GeoSnap contends the FAA controls, GeoSnap is mistaken; state law \ngoverns the issue of contract formation. See Arthur Andersen v. Carlisle , 556 U.S. 624, 630 \n(2009)  (The FAA does “not alter background principles of state contract law regarding \nthe scope of agreements”—“including the question of who is bound by them.”). See also \nSosa v. Onfido, Inc. , 8 F.4th 631, 637 (7th Cir. 2021)   (A “nonparty's right to enforce an \narbitration agreement is governed by state law.”); Janiga v. Questar Cap. Corp. , 615 F.3d \n735, 742 (7th Cir. 2010)  (“[C]ontract formation is governed by state law.”). As to which \nState’s substantive law controls, a federal court sitting in diversity applies the choice-of-Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 7 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>8 \n law rules of the forum state Wachovia Sec., LLC v. Banco Panamericano, Inc ., 674 F.3d 743 \n(7th Cir. 2012)  (internal citations omitted). So, Illinois choice-of-law rules determine what \nlaw governs the contract formation issue.  \nBut, as is explained more fully below, the Court need not engage in a lengthy \nchoice-of-law analysis. As previously noted, the Pre-2021 Agreements provide for the \napplication of the law in the State where the Tough Mudder event was held (in this case, \nIllinois), and the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements provide for the application of \nDelaware law. In a footnote, GeoSnap notes that the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements \nprovide for application of Delaware law. GeoSnap, however, does not discuss the Pre-\n2021 Agreements, including whether Pre-2021 Agreements contain a choice-of-law \nprovision.2 \nAt first glance, the substantive law of both Delaware and Illinois appear to be in \nplay. Plaintiff advocates for application of Illinois law and GeoSnap, albeit briefly, \nreferences a Delaware choice-of-law clause in the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements. But \n \n2 This is GeoSnap’s second motion to compel arbitration. In its first motion to compel arbitration (Doc. 45), which \nwas mooted by the filing of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (Doc. 58), GeoSnap argued for the application of Delaware law. At the time, Adam Moomaw and Regan Moomaw  were the only plaintiffs. GeoSnap argued that the \nMoomaw’s Pre-2021 Agreements included a choice of la w provision requiring the application of Delaware law. \nGeoSnap argued that, under Illinois law, as a non-signatory it could not enforce the arbitration provision in the \nMoomaw’s Pre-2021 Agreements, but under Delaware law Ge oSnap, as a non-signatory, could enforce the arbitration \nprovision. GeoSnap further argued that, given the choice of law provision in the Pre-2021 Agreements, the Court was \nrequired to apply the law of Delaware. Plaintiffs res ponded, noting that the Moomaw’s Pre-2021 Agreements did not \ncontain a choice-of-law clause  providing for the application of Delaware law. (Doc. 50). In fact, the Moomaw’s Pre-\n2021 Agreements included a provision providing  for the application of the law “in the State in which the TM Event is \nheld.” (Doc. 50, pgs. 8-9). In other words, Illinois law. Thereafter, GeoSnap filed a reply admitting that Plaintiffs were \ncorrect and alleging that the mistake was due to counsel inadvertently reviewing a diffe rent version of Tough Mudder’s \nliability agreement.

Therefore, to \nresolve the contract formation issue, the Court applies Illinois law. See Brunswick Leasing \nCorp. v. Wisconsin Cent ., Ltd., 136 F.3d 521, 525-26 (7th Cir. 1998)  (if neither party argues \nthat the forum state’s choice of law rules require the application of another state’s \nsubstantive law, then the substantive law of the forum state governs). \nThat being said, even if the Court were to conduct a choice-of-law analysis, the \nchoice-of-law provisions in the liability agreements would not control. Under \nIllinois choice-of-law rules, which follow the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts (1977), \ncourts will enforce a choice-of-law clause contained in the contract – when a valid \ncontract has been formed. See Kohler v. Leslie Hindman, Inc ., 80 F.3d 1181, 1185 (7th Cir. \n1996)  (“In disputes such as this one that arise from a contract, Illinois law respects the \ncontract's choice-of-law clause as long as the contract is valid .”) (emphasis added).  \nIn the instant case, Plaintiffs contend th ey did not enter into a contract with \nGeoSnap. When contract formation is in issue, applying the choice-of-law clause \ncontained in the disputed contract would assume the answer to the antecedent question of whether a contract was formed is yes. See e.g.,  Kaufman v. Am. Express Travel Related \nServs. Co., Inc. , No. 07 C 1707, 2008 WL 687224, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 7, 2008)  (“as an \n \n3 As noted above, in its initial motion to compel, GeoSnap argued for the application of Delaware law, which according \nto GeoSnap, allows non-signatories to a contract to co mpel arbitration under the contr act. In the instant motion, \nalthough GeoSnap claims the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements include a Delaware choice of law provision, GeoSnap \ndoes not advocate for the application of Delaware law. Th e Court therefore concludes that GeoSnap has abandoned \nthis argument, and to the extent that  it has not, the argument is waived. See Rock Hemp Corp. v. Dunn , 51 F.4th 693, \n704 (7th Cir. 2022) (“[P]erfunctory and undeveloped arguments, as well as arguments that are unsupported by \npertinent authority, are waived.”).

Only if the court finds a valid contract may it turn to the choice of \nlaw provision in the Agreement....”). See also e.g., Sosa v. Onfido, Inc ., No. 1:20 CV 04247, \n2021 WL 38141, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 5, 2021) , aff'd, 8 F.4th 631  (7th Cir. 2021) (when contract \nformation is in issue, it would be inappropriate to apply a choice-of-law provision \nbecause “the antecedent question of whether that document applies to the parties [has \nnot been resolved]”). Thus, if the Court were to conduct a choice-of-law analysis, any \nchoice-of-law provision would yield to the law of Illinois, which has adopted the “most \nsignificant relationship test” for deciding among conflicting laws. See Purcell & Wardrope \nChartered v. Hertz Corp.,  175 Ill.App.3d 1069, 125 Ill.Dec. 585, 530 N.E.2d 994, 1001 (Ill. \nApp. 1988) .  \nHaving resolved the threshold choice-of-law questions, the Court turns to whether \nGeoSnap, as a non-signatory to the liability agreements, has standin g to require Plaintiffs \nto arbitrate. GeoSnap asserts that it has a right to enforce the arbitration provisions \nbecause it is a third-party beneficiary to the Agreements. GeoSnap claims the Agreements apply broadly to “Released Parties.” The Pre-2021 Agreements (relating to Adam \nMoomaw, Regan Moomaw, and Gustafson’s attendance at the 2019 event in Rockford, \nIllinois) define “Released Parties” as “Tough-Mudder Incorporated and its directors, \nofficers, employees, agents, contractors, insurers, spectators, co-participants, equipment \nsuppliers, and volunteers.” (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 8, 16, 24). The Gustafson 2021/2022 \nAgreements (relating to Gustafson’s participation in Tough Mudder events in 2021 and Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 10 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>11 \n 2022 in Rockford, Illinois) define “Released Parties” as “OCR US Holdings, LLC d/b/a \nTough Mudder (“TM”) and its parent Spartan Race, Inc. (“Spartan”) and their respective \naffiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, insurers, spectators, co-\nparticipants, equipment suppliers, and volunteers.”(Doc. 62-1, pgs. 24, 32). The Pre-2021 \nAgreements incorporate Released Parties in to the term “Tou gh Mudder,” but the \n2021/2022 Gustafson Agreements do not incorporate Released Parties into the term \n“Tough Mudder.” Instead, the terms of the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements sometimes \ninclude “other Released Parties” and sometimes do not. (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 32-43). \nGeoSnap contends that it is a Released Party because “[e]ssentially, Released \nParties would apply to anyone or any compan y that had anything to do with the Tough \nMudder event.” (Doc. 62, pg. 10). Additionally, GeoSnap contends the Affiliate \nPartnership Agreement it entered with Tough Mudder Incorporated demonstrates that \nthe companies have a direct affiliate relationship. (Doc. 62-2).  \nPlaintiffs contend GeoSnap cannot be a third-party beneficiary because the \narbitration clauses contained in the Pre-2021 and Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements do \nnot refer to Released Parties or otherwise su ggest that it applies to or benefits Released \nParties.4  Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that GeoSnap’s third-party beneficiary \n \n4 Plaintiffs also contend that the terms of the Pre-2021 Agreements indicate that all Released Parties have substantial \ncontrol over how Tough Mudder events are operated. Plaintiffs  contend this conflicts with  GeoSnap’s prior declaration \nunder penalty of perjury declaring that “GeoSnap [does not] ha[ve] any role in…the promotion of [Tough Mudder] events, the enrollment of part icipants in those events, or  the operation of the events.” (Doc. 26-1, ¶ 10). Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs argue, GeoSnap is judicially estopped from clai ming it is a released Party. Because the Court finds that \nGeoSnap is not entitled to enforce the arbitration provisions in the Agreements, the Court need not address this \nargument. However, the Court notes that Released Parties includes groups that clearly do not exercise substantial \ncontrol over Tough Mudder or its events, including spectat ors, co-participants, and volunteers. Thus, the Court \nquestions the validity of this argument.  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 11 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>12 \n argument fails as to Gustafson because her agreements were executed on October 11, \n2018, August 5, 2021, and August 17, 2022, and the Affiliate Partnership Agreement was \nnot in effect when Gustafson executed her agreem ents. Further, Plaintiff notes that the \nlatter two agreements do not mention the entity that GeoSnap contracted with (Tough \nMudder Incorporated); they refer instead to “OCR US HOLDINGS, LLC d/b/a Tough \nMudder…and its parent SPARTAN RACE, INC.”  \n“A nonsignatory to a contract typically has no right to invoke an arbitration \nprovision contained in that contract.” Sosa v. Onfido , Inc., 8 F.4th 631, 639 (7th Cir. 2021)  \n(applying Illinois law). Generally, under Illinois law, only signatories to an arbitration \nagreement can move to compel arbitration. See Bishop v. We Care Hair Dev. Corp. , 738 \nN.E.2d 610, 619 (Ill. App. Ct. 2000) . But Illinois law recognizes exceptions to that general \nrule, under theories involving third-party beneficiaries, agency, and equitable \nestoppel. Id. (citing Ervin v. Nokia, Inc. , 714, 812 N.E.2d 534, 539–41 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004) ). \nIllinois law distinguishes between intended and incidental beneficiaries. Hacker v. Shelter \nInsurance Co.,  902 N.E.2d 188 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009) . An intended beneficiary is intended by \nthe parties to the contract to directly bene fit for the performance of the agreement; under \nthe contract an intended beneficiary has rights and may sue. Id. An incidental beneficiary \nhas no rights and may not sue to enforce them. Id.  “Illinois courts ... ‘recognize a strong \npresumption against conferring contractual benefits on noncontracting third parties.’ \n” Sosa, 8 F.4th at 639 , quoting  117 N.E.3d 1155, 1159 (Ill. App. Ct. 2018) . See also Coatney v. \nAncestry.com DNA, LLC,  93 F.4th 1014 (7th Cir. 2024 ) (describing the basis for third-Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 12 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>13 \n party beneficiary arguments as “shaky legal ground”). To overcome that presumption, \nas explained by the Seventh Circuit: \nIt is not enough to show that the part ies know, expect, or even intend that \nothers will benefit from the agreement. Instead, for a nonparty to qualify as \na third-party beneficiary, the language of  the contract must show that the \ncontract was made for the direct, not merely incidental, benefit of the third \nperson. This intention must be shown by an express provision in the contract identifying the third-party beneficiary by name or by description \nof a class to which the third party belongs. \n \nSosa, 8 F.4th at 639  (quotations omitted) (citing Marque Medicos Farnsworth, LLC , 117 \nN.E.3d 1155 (Ill. App. Ct. 2018) ; Martis v. Grinnell Mut. Reinsurance Co. , 905 N.E.2d 920, \n924 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009) ). Further, a third-party beneficiary can only enforce an arbitration \nagreement when “the signatories to the agreement intended that the nonsignatories were \nto derive benefits from the agreement and where the arbitration clause itself is \nsusceptible to this interpretation…” Dannewitz v. Equicredit Corp. of Am ., 775 N.E.2d 189, \n192 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002) . \nApplying the principles set forth above, the Court looks to the language in the \nliability agreements to determine whether GeoSnap was an intended beneficiary. The \nCourt need not spend long on its analysis. A review of the arbitration clauses in the Pre-2021 Agreements and the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements demonstrates that, even if \nGeoSnap is a Released Party, the arbitration clauses in the liability agreements do not \nindicate, in any way, an intent to benefi t Released Parties. Pursuant to its terms, the \narbitration provisions encompass “disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of my \n(and/or my participating minor child/ward’s participation in the TM Events.” (Doc. 62-\n1, pgs. 10, 18, 26, 40, 34-35). The arbitration clauses are silent as to nonparties, including Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 13 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>14 \n Released Parties, and there is no other language indicating that the arbitration provisions \nwere intended to directly benefit GeoSnap or “Released Parties.” Because the clauses \nthemselves cannot be interpreted as conferring a direct benefit on GeoSnap, Released \nParties,5 or any other nonparty, GeoSnap cannot compel Plaintiffs to arbitrate. Coatney, \n93 F.4th at 1024 (quoting Johnson v. Noble , 608 N.E.2d 537, 541 (Ill. App. Ct. 1992) . See also \nWashington v. Persona Identities , Inc., 2024 IL App (3d) 240210, ¶ 28 , appeal denied, 246 \nN.E.3d 1196 (Ill. 2024)  (“Unless a nonparty is expressly named or its class described, a \ngeneric arbitration clause—no matter how broad—cannot show an intent to directly \nbenefit the nonparty.”). \nAccordingly, GeoSnap’s Motion to Compel Arbitration will be DENIED .6 \nIII. DISCUSSION - MOTION TO DISMISS \nA. Legal Standard \nA defendant is entitled to dismissal only wh ere “it appears beyond doubt that the \nplaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim on which relief may be \ngranted.” Hickey v. O'Bannon,  287 F.3d 656, 657 (7th Cir.2002)  (affirming dismissal), \nciting Szumny v. American General Finance, Inc.,  246 F.3d 1065, 1067 (7th Cir.2001) ; \n \n5 Notably, pursuant to the liability agreements, “Released Parties” includes, among others, spectators and co-\nparticipants. Thus, to construe the arbitration clause as applicable to all “Released Parties” would lead to the untenable conclusion that even spectators or other partic ipants could enforce the arbitration provision. \n. \n6 Plaintiffs contend GeoSnap’s third-pa rty beneficiary argument “has yet anot her shortcoming specific to Plaintiff \nSarah Gustafson.” (Doc. 65, pgs. 11-12). Specifically, GeoSnap claims that, given its aff iliate Partnership Agreement \nwith Tough Mudder Incorporated, it is a “Released Party” under all of the liability agreements. The Affiliate \nPartnership Agreement, however, was not  in effect when Gustafson executed her liability agreem ents with Tough \nMudder. Additionally, the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements do not reference the entity that GeoSnap contracted with \n(Tough Mudder Incorporated). Instead, they refer to OCR US HOLDINGS, LLC d/b/a/ Tough Mudder…and its parent \nSPARTAN RACE, Inc.” These facts provide an additional inde pendent basis for finding that GeoSnap cannot compel \nGustafson to arbitrate.

Auth.,  52 F.3d 623, 626-27 (7th Cir. \n1995) . For purposes of deciding the motion, the court must treat the plaintiffs’ allegations \nas true and draw all inferences in their favor, although it need not give weight to \nunsupported conclusions of law. O'Bannon,  287 F.3d at 657-58 ; McLeod v. Arrow Marine \nTransp., Inc.,  258 F.3d 608, 614 (7th Cir.2001) ; Scott v. O'Grady,  975 F.2d 366, 368 (7th \nCir.1992) .  \nWhen ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion, a court may consider documents outside of the \nplaintiff's complaint if they are referred to in the complaint and central to the claim. \nWright v. Associated Ins. Companies Inc ., 29 F.3d. 1244, 1248 (7th Cir. 1994) . In the instant \ncase, GeoSnap’s contract with Tough Mu dder, GeoSnap’s Terms & Conditions, and \nGeoSnap’s Privacy Policy, which GeoSnap has submitted in support of hits 12(b)(6) \nmotion, are all referenced in the Complaint, and may be considered at this stage without \nconverting GeoSnap’s motion to a motion for summary judgment. Brownmark Films, LLC \nv. Comedy Partners , 682 F.3d 687, 690 (7th Cir. 2012) .7  \nB. Section 15(b) Claims \nUnder BIPA, Section 15(b) im poses three specific requirements on private entities \nthat “collect, capture, purchase, receive throug h trade, or otherwise ob tain a person's or \na customer's biometric identifier or biometric information.” 740 ILCS § 14/15(b) . \nSpecifically, a private entity may not collect such material unless it: \n \n7 However, as is discussed more fully herein, other extr insic materials relied on by GeoSnap are not alleged in or \nintegral to the complaint. As such, these materials will not be considered by the Court, and the Court declines to \nconvert the dismissal motion to a motion for summary judgment. Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 15 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>16 \n (1) informs the subject or the subject' s legally authorized representative in \nwriting that a biometric identifier or biometric information is being \ncollected or stored; \n \n(2) informs the subject or the subject' s legally authorized representative in \nwriting of the specific purpose and length of term for which a biometric \nidentifier or biometric information is being collected, stored, and used; \nand \n \n(3) receives a written release executed by the subject of the biometric \nidentifier or biometric information or the subject's legally authorized \nrepresentative.  \n740 ILCS § 14/15(b) .  \nCounts II -IV of the First Amended Complaint (Doc. 58) allege that GeoSnap \nviolated § 15(b) in its entirety and that ea ch violation of the three requirements is \nseparately compensable. GeoSnap, citing to Cothron v. White Castle Sys., Inc., 216 N.E.3d \n918 (Ill. 2023) , as modified on denial of reh'g (July 18, 2023), contends Plaintiffs cannot \nrecover statutory damages for its alleged violations of subsections 15(b)(1), 15(b)(2), and \n15(b)(3). Instead, GeoSnap argues, any violation of Section 15(b)’s requirements creates \none violation – not three. Accordingly, GeoSnap claims, Counts II-IV should be dismissed \nand Plaintiffs should have to plead those claims as a single cause of action.  \nIn Cothron, the Illinois Supreme Court addressed a related but distinct issue: \nwhether each unauthorized scan or transmission of  biometric data under Sections 15(b) \nand 15(d) constitutes a separate violation. Th e Court held that “a separate claim accrues \nunder the Act each time a private entity scans or transmits an individual's biometric \nidentifier or information in violation of section 15(b) or 15(d)” of the Act  Cothron, 216 \nN.E.3d at 920 . The Illinois Supreme Court also acknowledged that its decision opened the Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 16 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>17 \n door to “potentially excessive damage awards” under BIPA but concluded those policy-\nbased concerns were best addressed by the legislature. Id. at 929 .  \nCothron focused on repeated collections of bi ometric data rather than the separate \nrequirements within Section 15(b). Nonetheless, its reasoning suggests a broader \nprinciple: BIPA violations are connected to distinct acts or failures that contravene the \nstatute’s mandates. The majority emphasized  the plain language of Section 15(b), which \nprohibits collection “unless” the entity “firs t” complies with the three requirements. Id. \nat 925-26. The Court relied, in part, on its prior decision in Rosenbach v. Six Flags Entm’t \nCorp ., 129 N.E.3d 1197, 1206 (Ill. 2019) . Specifically, the Court stated: “[W]e determined \nin Rosenbach  that a person is ‘aggrieved’ or injured under the Act ‘when a private entity \nfails to comply with one of section 15's requirements.’ ” Id. at 927. The Court went to \nexplain that “ Rosenbach does not stand for the proposition that the ‘injury’ for a § 15 claim \nis predicated on, or otherwise limited to, an initial loss of control or privacy. Instead, \nRosenbach clearly recognizes the statutory violation itself is the ’injury’ for purposes of a \nclaim under the Act.” Id. at 928 . Although the Illinois court’s analysis was in the context \nof establishing an injury for standing ( Rosenbach ) and accrual of claims ( Cothron ), it \nsuggests that each requirement carries independent weig ht, supporting a finding that \nSection 15(b)’s subparts are separately compensable.8  \n \n8 In response to Cothron , the Illinois legislature amended BIPA via Senate Bill 2979. The amendment modified Section \n15(b) to state that a private entity that “in more than one instance, collects, capture s, purchases, receives through trade, \nor otherwise obtains the same biometric identifier or biometric information from the same person using the same \nmethod of collection” commits “a single violation” for which the aggrieved person is entitled to “at most, one \nrecovery.” Critically, the amendment focuses on repeated collections of the same biometric date; not on the separate \nrequirements within Section 15(b). Thus, the amendment does not alter this Court’s analysis.  \n Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 17 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>25 \n and (4) the purported BIPA compliant terms contained in the Policy are illusory. \n(Doc. 65, pgs. 19-22).  \nAlthough contracts formed by creating an account on a website are a \n“newer form[ ] of contracting,” the same common law contract principles apply: \nIn Illinois, as in many states, the law governing the formation \nof contracts on the Internet is still in the early stages of development. But \nthere is no reason to think that Illino is’s general contract principles do not \napply. Formation of a contract requires mutual assent in virtually all jurisdictions; Illinois courts use an objective approach to that question.  \nSgouros v. TransUnion Corp ., 817 F.3d 1029, 1034 (7th Cir. 2016) .  \n“Generally, a party who signs a written contract is presumed to have notice \nof all the contract’s terms.” Id. But, because many internet users fail to realize they \nare agreeing to a contract, applying this principle in the context of internet \ntransactions can be challenging. Id. In determining whether an agreement has been \nformed over the Internet, the Seventh Circuit has explained that “we might ask \nwhether the web pages presented to the consumer adequately communicate all \nthe terms and conditions of the agreem ent, and whether the circumstances support \nthe assumption that the [consumer]  receives reasonable notice of those \nterms.” Id. As the Appellate Court further explained, this analysis involves “a fact-\nintensive inquiry: we cannot presume that  a person who clicks on a box that \nappears on a computer screen has notice of all contents not only of that page but \nof other content that requires further action (scrolling, following a link, \netc.).” Id. at 1034–35 . Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 25 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>26 \n That being said, courts often find that an online contract has been formed \nwhen a customer clicks on an “I Accept” button as part of a “clickwrap” \nagreement. Domer v. Menard, Inc ., 116 F.4th 686, 694 (7th Cir. 2024)  (“Courts around \nthe country have recognized that this type of  electronic ‘click’ can suffice to signify \nthe acceptance of a contract.”) citing Sgouros , 817 F.3d at 1033 . “There is nothing \nautomatically offensive about such agreement s, as long as the layout and language \nof the site give the user reasonable notice that a click will manifest assent to an \nagreement.” Sgouros , 817 F.3d at 1033-34 .  \nGeoSnap contends the Website gave Adam Moomaw and Sarah Gustafson \nreasonable notice that by clicking the “I Agree” box, they were agreeing to the \nTerms, including the release clause found on page 11, and the Policy that GeoSnap \nalleges complies with BIPA. The problem for GeoSnap is that, on a motion to \ndismiss, the Court can only  consider extrinsic materials if they are referenced in or \ncentral to the First Amended Complaint. See Hecker v. Deere & Co.,  556 F.3d 575, \n582–83 (7th Cir. 2009) . In the instant case, this includes GeoSnap’s contract with \nTough Mudder, GeoSnap’s Terms of Service, and GeoSnap’s Privacy Policy, all of which are referenced in the Amended Co mplaint. This, however, does not include \nthe declaration provided by GeoSnap’s founder and CEO, the screenshots \npurportedly showing that Adam Moomaw and Sarah Gustafson created accounts, \nor the screenshot that purports to depict the Website’s account creation page. See \ne.g., Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 234 (2nd Cir. 2016)  (in deciding \nmotion to dismiss, it was error for the district court to rely on extrinsic materials Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 26 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>27 \n indicating that the plaintiff’s “purchases were made using an account created in \n2009 and that to have registered for an account in 2008 one must have checked a \nbox on the Registration Page, acknowledging acceptance of the 2008 Conditions of \nUse…[because] those facts were neither allege d in nor integral to the complaint.”). \nGeoSnap relies on these extrinsic materials to show that Adam Moomaw \nand Sarah Gustfason created accounts in 2019, and that to have created an account \nin 2019, they must have checked the “I Agree” box, which was positioned next to \nhyperlinks labeled “Terms of Service” and “Privacy Policy.” GeoSnap invites the \nCourt to consider this material and find that Adam Moomaw and Sarah Gustfason \npersonally created accounts in 2019 and personally assented to the Terms and \nPolicy. But to do so without converting the dismissal motion to a motion for \nsummary judgment would be error. \nRecognizing this issue, in a footnote, GeoSnap contends that to the extent \nthat these materials are deemed to be outside the Complaint,  the Court should \nconvert its motion to one for summary judgment. The Court declines to do so. \nFirst, GeoSnap has not provided the Court with sufficient evidentiary material to render a summary judgment decision. As previously noted, GeoSnap has not \nestablished that the account creation proce ss described in the declaration or that \nthe account creation screenshot attached to the declaration reflect the account \ncreation process in effect in 2019 or the account creation page as it existed in 2019.\n15 \n \n15 The declaration expressly states that GeoSnap is attach ing “[t]rue and accurate versions of the Terms & Conditions \nand Privacy Policy that existed in 2019.” (Doc. 62-2 ¶ 8). The declaration, however, does not provide the same \n Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 27 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>28 \n Thus, even if considered, the extrinsic materials would not conclusively resolve \nthe factual dispute as to notice and assent.  \nSecond, at the parties’ request, merits discovery was stayed pending \nresolution of the instant motion. (Docs. 37 and 43). Because Plaintiffs have not had \nthe opportunity to fully engage in discovery to provide support for their \nallegations, it would be premature to co nvert GeoSnap’s dismissal motion to a \nmotion for summary judgment. Accordingly, the Court declines to exercise its \ndiscretion to convert GeoSnap’s dismissal motion to a motion for summary \njudgment. See Levenstein v. Salafsky , 164 F.3d 345, 347 (7th Cir. 1998)  (where \ndiscovery was ongoing, district court’s decision to treat pleading as a motion to \ndismiss, rather than converting it to a summary judgment motion, was within \ndistrict court’s discretion).  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, Defendan t GeoSnap PTY LTD’s Motion to Compel \nArbitration or, Alternatively Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint (Doc. 62) is DENIED . \nThe Court FURTHER ORDERS  that the previously imposed stay on discovery is \nlifted. By separate Order, the Court will set a new trial date and will direct the Parties to  \n  \n \nassurances as to the declarant’s description of the account creation process or the screenshot purportedly representing \nthe account creation process.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   In the case of La Canada Ventures, Inc. v. MDalgorithms, Inc., the plaintiff claims trademark infringement and false advertising against the defendant, focusing on the use of the \"MDacne\" mark. The court granted partial summary judgment in favor of MDalgorithms, finding insufficient evidence of consumer confusion and false advertising. Although the case involved the use of AI technology by MDalgorithms to customize skincare products, the court noted that this did not contribute to confusion between the products. Additionally, the expert report offered by the plaintiff was excluded due to the lack of reliable methodology.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: \n   The key legal issues were whether MDalgorithms' use of the \"MDacne\" mark infringed on La Canada Ventures' trademarks by causing consumer confusion, and whether MDalgorithms engaged in false advertising under federal and California law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court held in favor of MDalgorithms, granting partial summary judgment on counts of trademark infringement and false advertising. The court found no material factual dispute regarding the likelihood of consumer confusion or the inaccuracy of MDalgorithms' advertising claims. Consequently, the trademark cancellation claim tied to \"MDacne\" failed as well.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine two companies: one sells beauty products, and the other offers a service that uses computers to make custom acne treatments. They both have products with \"MD\" in the name, and the beauty company thinks customers might mix them up. The court looked at the similarities and decided that customers probably wouldn't be confused since there wasn't much evidence showing they were. Also, the beauty company's expert's report was dismissed because he didn’t explain how he got his results properly. So, the acne-company didn't do anything wrong in the court's view, and they won this part of the lawsuit.",

INTRODUCTION  \nPlaintiff La Canada  Ventures, Inc., is a health and beauty retailer offering cosmetic products . \nDefendant MDalgorithms is a company that offers computer software and app technology  for \neducation and advice about the treatment of acne . Both parties create  and market skin and haircare \nproducts with the root mark “MD.” Plaintiff brought this action against Defendant , advanc ing \nseveral claims related to trademark infringement and false advertising in the operative Second \nAmended Complaint (“SAC”) . Defendant now moves for partial summary judgment on several of \nPlaintiff’s claims, specifically,  Counts I (federal trademark infringement  under the Lanham Act ) \nand II (unfair competition)  as to Defendant’s  “MDacne” mark , as well as Counts V and VI (false \nadvertising in violation of federal and California law). Defendant  also moves  to strike and exclude \nthe report  and associated testimony of  Plaintiff ’s expert, Richard Kostick , pursuant to Federal Rule \nof Ev idence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , 509 U.S. 579 (1993). For the \nreasons  discussed  below,  Defendant’s  motion for partial summary judgment and its Daubert  \nmotion are granted .

BACKGROUND  \nThe factual background of this case has been thoroughly described in previous orders. In \nshort , Plaintiff  owns seven trademarks .1 Defendant creates and sells MDacne and MDhair , which \nare customizable skincare and haircare product  kits. Plaintiff  does not sell a product called \nMDacne but does have an acne skincare product that displays the mark “MD” on the packaging. \nPlaintiff avers that its customers nonetheless confuse  the source of MDalgorithm’s products as \ncoming from Plaintiff. Where a customer confuses the source of the junior user’s product as the \nsenior user, that  is known as “forward confusion.” Other types of confusion actionable under the \nLanham Act include “reverse confusion,” which occurs when consumers approach the senior user, \nmistakenly believi ng they are dealing with the junior user, as well as the newly minted “initial \ninterest confusion,” which occurs when customers  are drawn to one party’s brand during their \nsearch  for its competitor’s products, and the former “capitalizes on the goodwill as sociated with \n[the latter’s] mark.”  Porta -Fab Corp. v. Allied Modular Bldg. Sys ., No. 8:20 -cv-01778 -JLS-JDE, \n2022 WL 4596646 at *3  (C.D. Ca. Jul. 24, 2022) ; see Ironhawk Tech., Inc. v. Dropbox, Inc ., 2 \nF.4th 1150, 11 59-60 (9th Cir. 2021 ).  \nIn its motion, Defendant  argues that Plaintiff has presented no evidence that its “MDacne” \nmark infringes on any of Plaintiff’s trademarks, warranting judgment on Counts I and II in the \nSAC for that mark . If judgment is granted for it on those claims, Defe ndant  further  contends that \nsummary judgment should also be granted as to Count III in the SAC, which seeks to cancel the \ntrademark registration for “MDacne.” Separately, Defendant moves for judgment as to Plaintiff’s \nfalse advertising claims, brought unde r federal and California law , because Plaintiff has produce d \nno evidence that Defendant’s statements about its own products violate Section 43 of the Lanham \nAct or California’s False Advertising Law (“FAL”), California Business & Professions Code § \n17500 et seq. Therefore, Defendant posits, these claims fail as a matter of law.  \n \n1 MD FACTOR (Reg. No. 6,309,386); MD  BY SUSAN F. LIN M.D. (Reg. No. 5,860,508); MD \nWELLNESS BY SUSAN F. LIN  M.D. (Reg.

In his \nreport, Kostick  opines that (1) Plaintiff consistently followed best practice for effectiv e digital \nmarketing and (2) the sales and revenue generated by Plaintiff do not reflect the expected return \nfrom its digital marketing investment . Defendant challenges Kostick’s research methodologies as \ndeficient and self -serving.  \nIII. MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMM ARY JUDGMENT  \nA. Legal Standard  \nA motion for summary judgment may be granted if the pleadings, discovery, and affidavits \nshow “that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. Pro . 56(a). A genuine issue of material fact is one that \ncould “affect the outcome of the suit.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \nEvidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and all justifiable \ninferenc es must be drawn in its favor. See Anderson , 477 U.S. at 255. The court need not  scour the \nrecord in search of a genuine issue of triable fact.  Keenan  v. Allan , 91 F.3d 1275, 1279 (9th Cir. \n1996) (citation omitted). The moving party bears the burden of proof to “make a showing \nsufficient to establish…the existence of an element essential to that party’s case.” Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett , 477 U.S. 317 (1986). If the movant succeeds in demonstrating the absence of a genui ne \nissue of material fact, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to “set forth specific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.” Id. at 322 n.3; see also  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. \n56(c)(1)(B). The non -moving party has the burden of identify ing, with reasonable particularity, the \nevidence that precludes summary judgment.  Keenan , 91 F.3d at 1279 . If the nonmoving party fails \nto make this showing, “the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”  Celotex , 477 \nU.S. at 322.  \nB. Federal  Trademark Infringement , Unfair Competition  – “MDacne”  \n“To prevail on a claim of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § \n1114, a party must prove: (1) that it has a protectible ownership interest in the mark; and (2) that \nthe defendant's u se of the mark is likely to cause consumer confusion.”  Network Automation, Inc. Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 3 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  v. Advanced Systems Concepts, Inc ., 638 F.3d 1137 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal citation omitted). \nSummary judgment on the likelihood of confusion is generally disfavored, but it m ay be granted \nin a trademark case where there is no genuine issue of material fact. Surfvivor Media, Inc. v. \nSurvivor Prods. , 406 F.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir. 2005).  In this motion, Defendant does not challenge \nPlaintiff’s ownership interest in the latter’s marks. Instead, it insists that its own use of “MDacne” \nis unlikely to cause customer confusion in the market.2  \nDefendant insists that Plaintiff averred only forward confusion in its SAC, thereby waiving \nall its arguments as to reverse or initia l interest confusion. See Surfvivor Media , 406 F.3d  at 631 \n(declining to determine whether the plaintiff raised a material issue of fact on the forward \nconfusion claim because he failed to reference it in his complaint). However, the Ninth Circuit has \nimposed no str ict pleading requirement to state a claim for trademark infringement under a \nparticular theory of confusion. Marketquest Grp., Inc. v. BIC Corp ., 862 F.3d 927, 932 -33 (9th \nCir. 2017)  (“[W] hen reverse confusion is compatible with the theory of infringement alleged in the \ncomplaint, a plaintiff need not specifically plead it ”). In the SAC, Plaintiff avers:  \nShortly after MDalgorithms began using its MD -based marks for \nproducts  that directly compete with those offered by La Canada, La \nCanada began receiving  complaints about products, e.g., “MD Hair,” \noffered by MDalgorithms.   \nSAC ¶ 25. Plaintiff indicates that customers are confused about the source of Defendant’s products \nand makes no mention of customer confusion as to the source of its own produc ts. Without such \nspecific facts  in the SAC , Plaintiff cannot now raise arguments regarding reverse confusion. \nHowever , because Plaintiff has averred  in the SAC  that Defendant seeks to erode its goodwill in \nthe SAC, Plaintiff’s arguments regarding initial interest confusion  remain actice .  \ni. Likelihood of confusion as to “MDacne”  \n“The sine qua non  of trademark infringement under the Lanham Act is customer \n \n2 While the SAC consists of averments regarding Defendant’s use of both the “MDacne” and \n“MDhair” marks, Defendant only references the “MDacne” mark in the instant motion. It does not \nmove for summary judgment on Counts I and II for the “MDhair” mark, so regardless of the \noutcome of the motion, those claims are live as to Defendant’s “MDhair” mark.  Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 4 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  confusion.” Network Automatio n, 638 F.3d at 1149. In AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats  \n(“Sleekcraft ”), the Ninth Circuit developed a flexible, non -exhaustive eight -factor test to guide the \nanalysis of the likelihood of consumer confusion. 599 F.2d 341 (9th Cir.  1979) . These factors are \n(1) strength of the mark; (2) proximity of the goo ds; (3) similarity of the marks;  (4) evidence of \nactual confusion; (5) marketing channels used; (6) type of goods and the degree of  care likely to \nbe exercised by the purchaser; (7) the defendant’s intent in selecting the mark; and (8)  likelihood \nof expans ion of the product lines.  Sleekcraft , 599 F.2d at 348.  For either party to prevail, it need \nnot satisfy all factors, and summary judgment may be granted “provided that strong showings are \nmade with respect to some of [the factors].” Surfvivor Media, Inc. , 406 F.3d at 631. \n1. Evidence of actual confusion  \nThe absence of evidence of actual confusion “need not create an inference that there is no \nlikelihood of confusion.” E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Gallo Cattle Co. , 967 F.2d 1280, 1292 (9th Cir. \n1992). However, wher e “there is scant evidence of actual confusion in the record[,]” this factor \nfavors a defendant. Surfvivor Media , 406 F.3d at 633.  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff has failed to present any evidence of actual confusion \nbetween its products and those of Plaintiff, and the “peaceful coexistence” of Defendant’s \nMDacne and Plaintiff’s products in the market establishes no likelihood of con fusion between the \ntwo. See Brookfield  Commc’ns, Inc. v. West Coast Ent. Corp. , 174 F.3d  1036,  1050  (9th Cir. \n1999)  (“We cannot think of more persuasive evidence that there  is no likelihood  of confusion \nbetween these two marks than the fact that they have been  simultaneously used for five years \nwithout causing any  consumers to be confused as to who makes  what ”). In support, Defendant \ncharges Plaintiff with failing to conduct a customer survey with results showing customer \nconfusion between MDacne and Plaintiff’s products, insisting that such a failure should \npresum ptively indicate that the results would be unfavorable for Plaintiff. See Cairns v. Franklin \nMint Co. , 24 F. Supp. 2d 1013, 1041  (C.D. Cal. 1998). The Ninth Circuit has not limited \nlikelihood of confusion evidence to surveys, however, and has provided that  “[t]here are at least \nthree types of proof of likelihood of confusion: (1) survey evidence; (2) evidence of actual \nconfusion; and (3) an argument based on an inference arising from a judicial comparison of the Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 5 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  conflicting marks themselves and the context of their use in the marketplace. In a close case \namounting to a tie, doubts are resolved in favor of the senior user .” Dr. Seuss Enterprises, L.P. v. \nPenguin Books, USA, Inc. , 109 F.3d 1394,  1404 n.14 (9th Cir. 1997). Nonetheless, a plaintiff’s \nfailure to offer  any proof indicating actual confusion  despite years of coexistence  tends to show \nthat this factor weighs in favor of the defendant. Here, Plaintiff’s proffered proo f, which is a \nsurvey conducted by  Defendant  showing confusion pertaining to Defendant’s  “MDhair” product, \nhas no relevance. The product at issue in the instant motion is Defendant’s “MDacne” product, \nwhich is intended to treat a distinct cosmetic matter and is marketed towards different customers \n(i.e., customers likely to purchase acne trea tments rather than hair -loss products). For this reason, \nPlaintiff’s contention that the survey yielded results establishing  that the common element “MD” \ncaused some initial interest confusion  is irrelevant . Even accepting the survey’s  application here, \nevidence of this purported  confusion  is exceedingly minimal such that no triable issue of fact is \ncreated, as consumer inquiries for MDhair represented not even 1% of Defendant’s total U.S. \nsales. Further , while Plaintiff asserts that Defendant advertises a nd promotes the two products \ntogether, this does not serve as a basis to extrapolate  the survey results of the “MDhair” product to \n“MDacne.”  Accordingly, this factor weighs in Defendant’s favor.  \n2. Strength of the mark  \nThe strength of a mark is determined in  two ways: first, its conceptual strength, i.e., how \ninherently distinctive it is, and second, its commercial strength, or how recognizable it is in the \nmarket. Conceptual strength classifies a mark along a spectrum of “generally increasing inherent \ndistin ctiveness as generic, descriptive, suggestive, arbitrary, or fanciful .” Network Automation , \n638 F.3d at 1149.  Commercial strength of a mark is based on “actual marketplace recognition.” \nBrookfield , 174 F.3d at 1058 . The more distinct ive a mark, the more it  warrants trademark \nprotection. “A suggestive mark conveys an impression of a good but requires the exercise of some \nimagination and perception to reach a conclusion as to the product ’s nature .” Id. at 1058 n.19. The \nNinth Circuit has held that a suggestive mark is presumptively weak. Id. at 1058.  \nPlaintiff insists that its family of marks, including the “MD” root mark, are presumptively \ndistinct because four of those marks  are incontestable , that is, they have been used in commerce Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 6 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  for five consecutive years and are still in such use . 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b). However, “the \nincontestable status of [a plaintiff’s] mark does not require a finding that the mark is strong.” \nEntrepreneur Media, Inc. v. Smith , 279 F.3d 1135, 11 42 n.3 (9th Cir. 2002).  \nPlaintiff next argues that the “MD” mark is suggestive because “ some level of imagination \nor perception is necessary to equate ‘MD’ with doctor of medicine .” In support, Plaintiff invokes \nthe MDhair survey, where participants ident ified Plaintiff as the source of MDhair because the \nproduct says “MD” on the packaging. However, while that evidence might tend to show whether \nparticipants were confused about the source of MDhair, it does not support Plaintiff’s argument \nthat MDhair is a strong mark.  Plaintiff has proffered no evidence to suggest that it would require \nsome imaginative leap to associate “MD” with doctor  (and, in fact, admits the converse in its \nSAC: “ 'MD’ is commonly understood to mean ‘Doctor of Medicine.’” SAC ¶ 22). The crowded \nfield of cosmetic products , including 50 other skincare product lines sporting the MD root mark , \nindicates otherwise .3 Indeed, “[u] se of similar marks by third -party companies in the relevant \nindustry weakens the mark at issue. ” M2 Software, I nc. v. Madacy Ent ., 421 F.3d 1073, 1088 ( 9th \nCir. 2005) . Furthermore, as  already explained in the order denying Plaintiff’s motion for partial \nsummary judgment as to MDhair, the USPTO also recognized the weakness of Plaintiff’s MD -\nformative marks when reje cting Plaintiff’s application to register “MD BEAUTY.” Even if \nPlaintiff were to establish that its marks were suggestive, the Ninth Circuit has held that a \nsuggestive mark is generally considered a weak mark barring some other determinant of the \nmark’s st rength, for example, actual marketplace recognition. Brookfield , 174 F.3d at 1058.  \nTurning, the n, to the commercial strength of Plaintiff’s mark , the analysis here measures \nthe degree of recognition of the market for the relevant consumer.  Plaintiff points to evidence of \n \n3 Plaintiff insists that Defendant’s “crowded field” argument constit utes inadmissible attorney \nargument because what constitutes the relevant “field” is a triable issue of fact and because \nDefendant has purportedly produced no evidence showing the field is crowded with other products \nwith the “MD” mark . Plaintiff has not explained why the relevant field ( skincare and haircare  \nproducts) is appropriately defined for purposes of its claims  of infringement  but not so to measure \nwhether it is crowded . Nonetheless , Defendant has produced evidence of 107 other current \nregistr ations for MD -formative marks and 50 other skincare product lines currently featuring MD -\nformative marks. Exh. M.  Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 7 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  its long and continued use of the “MD” mark on a variety of its products. However, that use was \nnon-exclusive, as evidenced by the many products consisting of MD -formative marks in the \nrelevant field. Nor has Plaintiff provi ded evidence of advertising expenditures or other indicators \nto transform its marks into a strong mark. See id. This factor, too, weighs against a likelihood of \nconfusion.  \n3. Similarity of the goods  \nThis factor is neutral. “ Related goods are generally more li kely than unrelated goods to \nconfuse the public as to the producers of the goods .” Brookfield , 174 F.3d at 1055. While the \nparties’ acne products are close in proximity  as both are skincare products intended to treat acne,  \nDefendant argues that its produc t is distinct because it uses artificial intelligence to customize \nformulation . The Ninth Circuit has provided that a court should “apply a sliding scale approach as \nto the weight that relatedness will carry  dependent upon the strength of the trademark hol der’s \nmark .” Here, the mark is relatively weak, so it is possible that consumers may well recognize the \nMD mark as representing a medical doctor, “not because of an association with [Plaintiff’s \nproducts].” Entrepreneur Media, Inc. , 279 F.3d at 1145. Howev er, the similar function of the \nproducts, notwithstanding Defendant’s purported use of AI to customize its formula, renders this \nfactor neutral.  \n4. Defendant’s intent  \n“When the alleged infringer knowingly adopts a mark similar to another's, reviewing \ncourts presume that the defendant can accomplish his purpose: that is, that the public will be \ndeceived. ” Sleekcraft , 599 F.2d at 354. Plaintiff has proffered no evidence in support of the \nargument that Defendant or its principals knew of Plaintiff’s marks when it adopted “MDacne” in \n2017. Plaintiff instead insists  that Defendant knew of Plaintiff’s “MD” mark early as J une 24, \n2021 , when Defendant cited Plaintiff’s “MD” mark in its office action response. However, the \nmark was adopted in 2017, and Plaintiff has proffered no evidence showing that Defendant \nadopted the mark to deceive the public. This factor thus weighs ag ainst a finding of confusion.  \n5. Similarity of the marks  \n“In analyzing the similarity of the marks, the court is to view the marks as a whole, as they Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 8 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  appear in the marketplace. ” E. & J. Gallo Winery v. Gallo Cattle Co. , 967 F.2d 1280, 1291 (9th \nCir. 1992). This factor weighs in Plaintiff’s favor as s imilarities in marks “weigh more heavily \nthan differences.” Alpha Indus., Inc. v. Alpha Steel Tube & Shapes, Inc. , 616 F.2d 440, 444 (9th \nCir. 1980). Plaintiff and Defendant’s products utilize the common prefix “ MD” followed by \nanother term. The common use of this “dominant element ” tends to show similarity in the parties’ \nmarks. Id.  \n6. Degree of care exercised by purchasers  \nCustomers of skincare and fragrance products often exercise  a high degree of care and \nprecisio n in their purchase. See Glow Indus. v. Lopez , 252 F.  Supp.  2d 962, 1001 (C.D.  Cal. 2002) . \nPlaintiff’s expert testimony supports this idea by acknowledging that consumers’ decision -making \nin this area tends to be highly involved. The goods here are special ty skincare products intended to \ntreat sensitive skin issues, and consumers are likely to be sophisticated purchasers exercising \nsignificant care in selecting their products. This factor also weighs against a finding of confusion.  \n7. Marketing channels  \n“Conve rgent marketing channels increase the likelihood of confusion.” Nutri/Sys., Inc. v. \nCon-Stan Indus.,  Inc., 809 F.2d 601, 606 (9th Cir. 1987).  The parties sell and market their \nproducts through websites and online platforms, but the Ninth Circuit has cautio ned that, today, “ it \nwould be the rare commercial retailer that did not advertise online, and the shared use of a \nubiquitous marketing channel does not shed much light on the likelihood of consumer confusion .” \nNetwork Automation , 638 F.3d at 1151. Consequently, this factor is neutral.  \n8. Expansion of product lines  \n“[A] ‘strong possibility’ that either party may expand his business to compete with the \nother will weigh in favor of finding that the present use is infringing. ” Sleekcraft , 599 F.2 d at 354. \nFurther, “[w] hen goods are closely related, any expansion is likely to result in direct competition .” \nId. Plaintiff p oints out that Defendant uses “four marks” – two of which are the subject of this \naction – in the MD family and plans on expanding its  business. However, the parties already \ncompete in this area, thus already exist in one another’s “submarket.” Id. This factor is accordingly \nneutral.

Victoria's Secret Stores Brand Management, \nInc., 744 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir. 2014) . Section 37 states that “ cancellation may only be sought if \nthere is already an ongoing action that involves a registered mark; it does not indicate that a \ncancellation claim is available as an independent cause of action. ” Id.  \nC. False Advertising under Federal and State law  \nTo state a claim under California’s False Advertising Law (“FAL”) , which prohibits  untrue \nor misleading advertising,  “it is necessary only to show that members of the public are likely to be \ndeceived”  as judged by a “reasonable consumer.”  In re Tobacco II Cases , 46 Cal. 4th 298, 312 \n(2009) (internal quotati on omitted) ; Shaeffer v. Calif ia Farms, LLC, 44 Cal. App. 5th 1125, 1136 \n(2020); Cal. Bus. & Prof.  Code, § 17 500 et seq . A plaintiff advancing a claim for false advertising \nunder  Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act  must show  (1) a false statement of fact by the defendant in \na commercial advertisement about its own or another ’s product;  (2) the statement actually \ndeceived or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience;  (3) the deception is \nmaterial, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision;  (4) the defendant caused its false \nstatement to enter interstate commerce; and  (5) the plaintiff has been or is likely to be injured as a \nresult of the false statement, either by direct diversion of sales from itself to a defendant or by a \nlessening of the goodwill associated with its products.  Skydive Arizona, Inc. v. Quattrocchi , 673 \nF.3d 1105, 1110 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)(1)(B)) .  \ni. Misleading or Literally False statements    \n“To demonstrate falsity within the meaning of the Lanham Act, a plaintiff may show that \nthe statement was literally false, either on its face or by necessary implication, or that the Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 10 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  statement was literally true but likely to mislead or confuse consumers. ” Kwan Softwarre \nEngineering, Inc. v. Foray Technologies, Inc., 2014 WL 572290  at *3 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 11, 2014) \n(citing to Southland Sod Farms v. Stover Seed Co ., 108 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir.1997) ). \nSimilarly, u nder California’s FAL, a statement does not have to be literally false to be unlawful if \nit is “likely to mislead the public.” Fitzhenry -Russsell v. Keurig Dr. Pepper Inc. , 345 F. Supp. 3d \n1111, 1115 (N.D. Cal. 2018). Plaintiff bases its false advertisemen t claims on four grounds: first, \nDefendant’s MDacne and MDhair products  are not individually customized; second, Defendant \ndoes not offer “unlimited dermatologist support;” third, Defendant’s products are not FDA \napproved; and fourth, Defendant’s return po licy states its products cannot be returned because they \nare medical products. Plaintiff has offered no evidence in support of the notion that these \nstatements are literally false  or misleading in any regard.   \nFirst, Defendant’s skin and haircare kits are customized based on a customer’s skin and \nhaircare needs . Plaintiff’s insistence that Defendant is falsely advertising its products because the \nindividual  chemical formulations of th e products within th ose customized kits consist of over -the-\ncounter formul ations is unavailing.  Plaintiff has proffered no evidence to support this restricted \nview of the term “customized.”   \nSecond, Plaintiff insists that Defendant falsely advertises its promise of “unlimited \ndermatologist support” because Defendant only has on e dermatologist, who is not allowed to \npractice in the U.S., that can offer support to its customers. This argument also falls short of \nindicating deceit . Defendant provides evidence  that the reference to the plural “dermatologists” \nwas made mistakenly onl y once on its website, and the typo has since been fixed. Elsewhere on \nDefendant’s website it notes that customers may receive “dermatologist support” – a statement \nthat is not literally false  or misleading . The fact that the  dermatologist in question is u nable to \npractice in the U.S. is inapposite – Dr. Harth is licensed to practice in Israel and is a dermatologist.  \nThird, Plaintiff claims that Defendant’s products are not FDA -approved, invoking a slide -\ndeck prepared by Defendant and disseminated to invest ors that was never distributed publicly. \nNotwithstanding that Defendant’s  products contain benzol peroxide, salicylic acid, and sulfur  – Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 11 of 17ORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ingredients cleared by the FDA to treat acne – Plaintiff has proffered no evidence disseminated to \nconsumers that indic ate Defendant’s products are FDA approved. Rather, Defendant’s website \nstates clearly that its products consist of “clinically proven and FDA cleared topical anti -acne \ningredients.” This statement is consistent with the formulation s of Defendant’s pro ducts and is \nalso not literally false  or misleading . \nFinally, Plaintiff argues that Defendant refuses to permit customer to return products \nbecause they are “medical products.” However, Defendant’s terms of service actually state  that the \nproducts “cannot  be reused if returned” because they are medical products that another customer  \nmay not reuse. Plaintiff seems to be objecting to Defendant’s use of the term “medical products” \nbecause it is not selling “prescription products, only recommended combinations  of over -the-\ncounter products.” Plaintiff has provided no evidentiary support for the argument that “medical” is \nlimited to a prescribed product . This statement, too, is neither misleading nor  literally false. \nii. Damages\nEven accepting that Plaintiff has averred that one of Defendant’s statements is literally \nfalse  or misleading , it has failed to show that it suffered damage as a result of Defendant’s \npurported false advertising. “I n a suit for  damages under section 43(a) [of the Lanham Act], actual \nevidence of some injury resulting from  the deception is an essential element of the plaintiff’s \ncase.” Harper House, Inc. v. Thomas Nelson, Inc ., 889 F.2d 197, 210 (9th Cir. 1989) . Plaintiff has \nfailed to identify specific damages arising from Defendant’s false statements, arguing instead that \nits damages expert was right in calculating damages for trademark infringement and false \nadvertising identically, because “the tests are identical.” Plaintiff has offered no basis to explain \nwhy damages it suffered as  a result of Defendant’s alleged infringement of Plaintiff’s trademarks \nare identical to those resulting from  Defendant’s alleged false statements. That Plaintiff has the \nsame damage theory as to its trademark infringement and false advertising claims – disgorgement \nof Defendant’s profits – does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the injury or misconduct \nunder both theories are identical . Damages must be tethered to the alleged misconduct, and a \ntrademark infringement is a distinct violation from f alse advertising . Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 12 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  IV. MOTION TO STRIKE EXPERT REPORT AND TESTIMONY  \nA. Legal Standard  \n Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires that a witness proffered as an expert by a party be \nqualified by “knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.” Even if a witness  is qualified \nas an expert in a particular field, any scientific, technical, or specialized testimony is admissible \nonly if it (a) “will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,” \n(b) “is based upon sufficient facts  or data,” (c) “is the product of reliable principles and methods,” \nand (d) “the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.” Id. \nIrrelevant or unreliable testimony is prohibited under Rule 702. Daubert v. Merrell Dow P harm., \nInc., 509 U.S. 579, 589 (1993). Expert opinion testimony is reliable if such knowledge has a \n“basis in the knowledge and experience of [the relevant] discipline.” Daubert , 509 U.S. at 592. \nUnder Daubert , courts should consider the following factors when evaluating whether an expert ’s \nproposed testimony is reliable: (1) “whether a theory or technique . . . can be (and has been) \ntested,” (2) “whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication[,]” \n(3) the known or potentia l error rate of the particular scientific theory or technique, and (4) the \ndegree to which the scientific technique or theory is accepted in a relevant scientific community. \nId. at 593 –94. This list is not exhaustive, however, and the standard is flexible.  Kumho Tire Co. v. \nCarmichael , 526 U.S. 137, 151 (1999). The Daubert  inquiry “applies not only to testimony based \non ‘scientific’ knowledge, but also to testimony based on ‘technical’ and ‘other specialized’ \nknowledge.” Id. at 141.  \nThe court ’s task is not to “decid[e] whether the expert is right or wrong, just whether his \ntestimony has substance such that it would be helpful to a jury.” Alaska Rent -A-Car, Inc. v. Avis \nBudget Grp., Inc. , 738 F.3d 960, 969 –70 (9th Cir. 2013). Courts may not excl ude testimony \nsimply because it is impeachable. Id. at 969. “Vigorous cross -examination, presentation of \ncontrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and \nappropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence. ” Daubert , 509 U.S. at 596. The \nfocus of the inquiry is thus on the principles and methodology employed, not the conclusions Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 13 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  reached by the expert. See id.  at 595. Ultimately, the purpose of the assessment is to exclude \nspeculative or unreliable testimony to ensure accurate, unbiased decision -making by the trier of \nfact. \nThere are several reasons why an expert’s proposed testimony may be excluded, including \nthe expert’s lack of qualification, the inapplicability of the proposed testimony, and the \nunreliability of the proposed testimony. Defendant primarily contends that Ko stick’s report and \nany associated testimony should be excluded because it is unreliable.  \nB. Kostick’s opinion that  Plaintiff engaged in best practices for digital marketing  \nWhether Kostick’s methodology is sound is unknowable because he does not state his \nmethodology with sufficient specificity to satisfy even the very liberal standard under Daubert . \nKostick describes the steps of his analysis in only the most general of terms. For example, he \nstates in only four lines of text that he conducted a “website aud it” using three tools: Google \nSearch Console, Google Optimize, and GTMetrix. Left unstated is what Kostick actually did with \nthese tools. Further, while Kostick states that the audit provided “valuable insights” and “potential \nareas for improvement,” he do es not elaborate as to either. None of the other four analytical steps4 \nenumerated in Kostick’s report provide any greater insight into his actual methods, making it \nimpossible to test his results.  \nPlaintiff argues that Kostick’s methodology is adequately  stated and that cross -\nexamination, not exclusion, is the appropriate way for Defendant to attack his opinions. Although \n“vigorous cross -examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the \nburden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible \nevidence,” Daubert , 509 U.S. at 596, Defendant rightly points out that Kostick’s report is so vague \nas to his methodology that it precludes effective cross -examination. Courts are “ supposed to \nscreen the jury from unreliable nonsense opinions, but not exclude opinions merely because they \n \n4 Kostick’s report states that his analysis included the following steps: (1) Website Audit, (2) \nKeyword Research, (3) Competitive Analysis, (4) Content Analysis, and (5) Link Profile Analysis. \nKostick does not describe any step in more than four lines of text.  Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 14 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  are impeachabl e.” Alaska Rent -A-Car, 738 F.3d at 969. Here, however, Defendant cannot impeach \nan unknowable method that was not properly documented.  \nKostick’s methodology  is excludable for another reason: he did not record his work. If the \nvagueness of Kostick’s report could be cured by complete contemporaneous notes and \ndocumentation, it might be admissible on the grounds that Defendant could use that \ndocumentation effectively to cross -examine him. However, for at least several key steps in \nKostick’s analysis, no such documentation exists. Kostick’s report simply states that he used \nGTMetrix to conduct his website audit. When asked at his deposition if he took any notes du ring \nthat process, Kostick replied that he could not recall and that he provided Plaintiff with any notes \nhe did write, but Plaintiff has not produced any notes regarding GTMetrix. Similarly, Kostick’s \nreport states that he used Ubbersuggest to conduct key word research, but he does not recall \nwhether he preserved any results or data from his use of that program and no such documents have \nbeen produced by Plaintiff. Basic documentation of an expert’s analytical process is not, as \nPlaintiff argues, merely add itional information that Defendant would like to see, but rather an \nessential part of an expert report that cuts to the heart of whether the method “ can be or has been \ntested.” City of Pomona , 750 F.3d at 1046 . \nPlaintiff relies on Surgical Instrument Service Company, Inc. v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. , \nwhere a court in this district rejected a motion to exclude the testimony of several experts. No. 21 -\nCV-03496 -AMO, 2024 WL 1975456  (N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2024) . That case is easily distinguished. \nThere, the moving party’s challenges were rooted in nuanced issues with qualifications or \nmethods, such as an expert’s failure to consider certain evidence during their analysis. Id. At *6. \nRegardless, the reports and testimony of multiple experts, although  potentially flawed, could not \nbe excluded on reliability grounds. Conversely, here Defendant is challenging Kostick’s failure to \ndocument and disclose his methods in the first place. Although the court in Surgical Instruments  \nrightly held that “flaws in a  proffered expert’s analysis typically go to the weight, rather than the \nadmissibility, of the expert’s testimony,”  id. at 2, where analysis is not adequately documented, a \ndistrict court must fulfill its gatekeeper function and exclude the testimony.  Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 15 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Kost ick’s report further runs afoul of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B)(ii), \nwhich requires that an expert’s report contain “ the facts or data considered by the witness in \nforming” their opinions. “A testifying expert must disclose and therefore ret ain whatever materials \nare given him to review in preparing his testimony . . . because such materials often contain \neffective ammunition for cross -examination.” Fid. Nat. Title Ins. Co. of New York v. Intercounty \nNat. Title Ins. Co. , 412 F.3d 745, 751 (7t h Cir. 2005) (discussing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n26). Because Kostick did not document his analytical process and cannot confirm which materials \nhe relied upon in forming his opinions, his report and associated testimony also run afoul of \nFederal R ule of Civil Procedure 26 and are unreliable.  \nC. Kostick’s opinion that Plaintiff did not achieve the expected return from its digital \nmarketing investment  \nDefendant moves to strike an additional opinion in Kostick’s report; that is, that “a solid \ninvestment in digital marketing should result in a return of 2 -5 times during the short term and \nmore in life time value of the customer.” However, the report provides no additional information \nabout this claim or its basis. When asked during his deposition about the  claim, Kostick confirmed \nthat he did not cite a source and could not identify a potential source supporting this claim despite \nit being supposed common knowledge. “N othing in either Daubert  or the Federal Rules of \nEvidence requires a district court to adm it opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only \nby the ipse dixit  of the expert. ” Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner , 522 U.S. 136, 146 (1997) . Kostick’s \nclaim regarding a reasonably expected return for a digital marketing investment is fundamental to \nhis analysis and must have some basis in order to be reliable under Daubert . \n The ten blog posts and articles listed by Kostick as “authoritative sources” to shed light on \nthe potential returns from the kinds of marketing investments employed by Plaintiff add nothing to \nsupport his report’s reliability. Because he did not provide ci tations for any of these ten sources, \nKostick fails to make clear exactly what articles he is relying on. However, even a cursory search \nfor these ten sources makes clear that they are not from reliable peer -reviewed publications. \nRather, Kostick is appare ntly citing to industry magazines and blogs run by technology companies Case 3:22-cv-07197-RS     Document 98     Filed 08/02/24     Page 16 of 17 \nORDER ON DEFENDANT ’S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT , MOTION TO STRIKE  \nCASE NO.  22-cv-07197 -RS \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  who are likely writing with incentives irrelevant here. See Daubert , 509 U.S. at 593–94 (whether a \ntheory has been subjected to peer review is relevant to its reliability). Moreover, b y Kostick’s own \naccount, each of these sources consist of generic discussions of digital marketing and are not \nclearly connected to his analysis. Kostick does not himself connect these sources to his analysis \nwhatsoever, instead merely listing them and sum marizing their main points in a few words. Thus, \nthose ten referenced sources add nothing. Kostick’s opinion is mere ipse dixit  and therefore \nexcludable.  \nV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons explained herein, Defendant’s motion for partial summary judgment and \nmotio n to strike are granted. Judgment is granted for Defendant on Counts I, II, and III in \nPlaintiff’s SAC as to the “MDacne” mark. Count s I and II  remain as to Defendant’s “MDhair” \nmark.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves Desiree Schmitt filing a lawsuit against SN Servicing Corporation (SNSC) for a data breach that occurred in late 2020, affecting over 170,000 customers whose personal and financial information was compromised. Schmitt claims that SNSC failed to adequately protect this data and delayed notifying affected customers for three months. The court partially granted and partially denied SNSC's motion to dismiss, allowing Schmitt's claims under negligence and the “unfair” prong of California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL) to proceed but dismissing her invasion of privacy claim with prejudice.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Schmitt has sufficiently pleaded claims for invasion of privacy and under the “unlawful” and “unfair” prongs of California’s UCL, and negligence, based on SNSC’s alleged failure to protect customers' personal data and delay in notification about the breach.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted SNSC's motion to dismiss with prejudice regarding the invasion of privacy claim, as it did not meet the egregiousness standard required under California law. The “unlawful” UCL claim was dismissed but with an opportunity to amend, as Schmitt did not specify which FTC guidelines were violated. However, the claims under the “unfair” prong of the UCL and negligence claims were adequately pleaded and allowed to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're a customer of a company that was supposed to keep your sensitive information safe, but they got hacked and your data was stolen. You found out months after it happened, which made you upset and worried. So, you sue the company saying they didn’t do a good job protecting your information and didn't tell you fast enough.

No. 35  \n \n \nPlaintiff Desiree Schmitt brings this lawsuit against defendant SN Servicing Corporation \n(“SNSC”) on behalf of a nationwide class of impacted borrowers for claims arising out of a data \nbreach incident that occurred on SNSC’s system in late 2020 , of which SNSC did not notify its \ncustomers for three months.   SNSC has filed a motion to dismiss Schmitt’s First Amended \nComplaint  (“FAC”) , which is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part, with leave to amend.  The \nmotion is GRANTED with prejudice on Schmitt’s invasion of privacy claim  because  she has not \nadequately alleged egregious conduct by SNSC.  The motion is also GRANTED on the claim \nbrought under the “unlawful” prong of the UCL, with leave to amend.  Although the Ninth Circuit \npermits the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Act and Guides to serve as predicates for \nunlawful  UCL claims, Schmitt has not pleaded these violations with enough specificity.  The \nmotion is DENIED on Schmitt’s claim brought under the “unfair” prong of the UCL as well as her \nnegligen ce claim, as she has sufficiently pleaded e lements of both.   \nBACKGROUND  \nSchmitt was a customer of SNSC, a financial services corporation that specializes in \nservicing residential, small balance commercial, consumer, and unsecured loans.  FAC [Dkt. No. \n34] ¶ 10.  On or about October 15, 2020, a ransomware -threat group known as “Mount Locker” Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 1 of 17 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (the “Unauthorized Party”) deployed ransomware into SNSC’s system and successfully acquired a \nnumber of digital files maintained by SNSC ( known hereinafter as the “d ata breach”).  Id. at ¶ 15.  \nShe states that the personal and financial information of at least 170,426 people  were stolen and \nheld for ransom.  Id. at ¶ 18.  She also alleges that despite learning of the data breach and alerting  \nthe Federal Bureau of Inve stigation “almost immediately,” SNSC did not notify Schmitt or class \nmembers  of the breach  until January 14, 2021.  Id. at ¶ 19.  \n SNSC’s  Notice of Data Breach  (“Notice”)  informed recipients that personal information \nwas acquired through a “ransomware” atta ck that “may include, but is potentially not limited to: \nyour name, address, loan numbers, balance information and billing information such as charges \nassessed, owed and/or paid.”  Id. at ¶ 20 (citing Ex. B).  The letter also stated that SNSC was “still \nin the process of conducting a comprehensive investigation of this incident” and that recipients \n“will be notified in the event we discover that any additional nonpublic personal information \n(‘NPI’) or personally identifiable information (‘PII’) pertaining t o you was exposed.”  Id. at ¶ 21 \n(citing Ex. B).  The Notice  encouraged recipients, “[o]ut of an abundance of caution,” to “remain \nvigilant . . . review your account statements and immediately report any suspicious activity.”  See \nid. at ¶ 67; Ex. B.  It a lso recommended that recipients “obtain credit reports from each nationwide \ncredit reporting agency.”  Id.   \n Schmitt claims that she did just that, purchasing credit monitoring at an annual cost of \nmore than $200, along with a password manager (costing $3  per month) and password protection \n(costing more than $90).  FAC at ¶ 68.  She also contends that she has spent and will continue to \nspend “ time and energy protecting and monitoring her  identity and  credit,” including at least four \nhours reviewing bank ac counts and statements and at least 10 hours changing “hundreds of \npasswords related to her business and personal accounts. ”  Id. at ¶ 69.   \n This vigilance was warranted, Schmitt contends.  She alleges that o n or around July 16, \n2021, SNSC provided a suppl emental disclosure to some class members stating that names, \ncontact information, birthdates, Social Security numbers, and “loan/borrower information” had \nalso been stolen in the data breach.  Id. at ¶ 30 (citing Ex. C).  Schmitt concedes that she did not \nreceive the July 16 letter, but notes that she had already filed this lawsuit when it was distributed .  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 2 of 17 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Id. at ¶ 66.  Schmitt further argues that she had “no reason to doubt, and every reason to assume,” \nthat her Social Security number, birthdate, and “loa n/borrower information” was “ also stolen and \nin the hands of criminals.”  Id.  Schmitt asserts that she and other class members “provided their \nlenders, servicers, and SNSC with significant personal, income, and financial information that \nSNSC was able to acquire and to supplement by obtaining credit reports and banking information \nfrom third parties.”  Id. at ¶ 63.  This information, she contends, includes: full name s, mailing \naddress es, phone numbers, email addresses, loan identification numbers, tax info rmation, and \nSocial Security numbers.  See id .  \n Schmitt contends  that personal and financial information is “such a valuable commodity to \nidentity thieves that once information has been compromised, criminals often trade the \ninformation on the ‘cyber blac k-market’ for years.”  Id. at ¶ 53.  As such, she argues, “there is a \nstrong probability that entire batches of stolen information have been dumped on the black market, \nor are yet to be dumped on the black market,” placing her and other class members “at an \nincreased risk of fraud and identity theft for many years into the future.”  Id. at ¶ 54.  She also \nalleges  that after the data breach, she has experienced an “increase in spam, phishing attempts, and \nsocial engineering,” including repeated robotexts to her cell phone.  Id. at ¶ 70.  \n Schmitt blames SNSC for the data breach, arguing that its “failure to adhere to reasonable \nand necessary industry standards . . . resulted in the Data Breach and exacerbated its scope and \nimpact.”  Id. at ¶ 32.  She claims that SNSC undertook  “basic steps  recognized in the industry” to \nprotect her and other class members’ personal and financial information only after the breach.  Id. \nat ¶ 35.  According to Schmitt,  these steps included “replacing email filtering tools, malware \nsoftware, and Internet monito ring tools with more robust solutions that utilize artificial \nintelligence (AI) to detect and block known and newly introduced malware,” and blocking all \nInternet traffic with foreign countries.  See id . (citing Ex. B).  Schmitt also alleges that SNSC \nfailed to comply with FTC cybersecurity standards.  See id . at ¶¶ 37 -43.  Schmitt argues that had \nSNSC properly maintained its systems and protected Schmitt and other class members’ \ninformation, it could have prevented the breach.  See id . at ¶ 44.  She also c ontends that SNSC \n“should have notified all of its customers much sooner.”  Id. at ¶ 45. Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 3 of 17 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Schmitt filed this lawsuit in San Francisco County Superior Court on March 12, 2021, \nbringing three claims on behalf of a nationwide class of borrowers impacted by th e data breach: \n(1) negligence; (2) invasion of privacy; (3) the “unlawful” and “unfair” prongs of California’s \nUnfair Competition Law (“UCL”).1  On May 5, 2021, SNSC removed the action to federal  court \nand subsequently filed a motion to dismiss for failur e to state a claim.  Dkt. Nos. 1, 14.  Although I \nfound that Schmitt could assert California law claims as an Ohio resident, she failed to plausibly \nplead elements of those claims.  See Mot. to Dismiss Order (“First MTD Order”) [Dkt. No. 27] 1.  \nAs such, I  denied the motion in part and granted in part with leave to amend.  Id.  Schmitt filed her \nFAC on August 30, 2021, which prompted a second motion to dismiss by SNSC.  Dkt. Nos. 34, \n35.  I now consider that motion.  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civi l Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint \nif it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss, the plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausib le on its \nface.”  See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible \nwhen the plaintiff pleads facts that allow the court to “draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  See Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)  \n(citation omitted).  There must be “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.”  Id.  While courts do not require “heightened fact pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff \nmust allege facts sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  See Twombly , \n550 U.S. at 555, 570.    \n In deciding whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, the \ncourt accepts the plaintiff’s allegations as true and dra ws all reasonable inferences in their favor.  \nSee Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987).  However, the court is not \nrequired to accept  as true  “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, \n \n1 A second plaintiff, James Furth, was named in the original complaint.  See Dkt. No. 1.  However, \nFurth was not named in the Amended Complaint, nor any of the filings related to this Motion to \nDismiss.  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 4 of 17 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  or unreasonable inferences.”  See In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. \n2008).  \nIf the court dismisses the complaint, it “should grant leave to amend even if no request to \namend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pl eading could not possibly be cured \nby the allegation of other facts.” See Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000).  In \nmaking this determination, the court should consider factors such as “the presence or absence of \nundue delay, bad faith, dila tory motive, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by previous \namendments, undue prejudice to the opposing party and futility of the proposed amendment.”  See \nMoore v. Kayport Package Express , 885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir. 1989).  \nDISCUSSION  \nI. INVASION OF PRIVA CY \nUnder California law, a plaintiff must show three elements to adequately state a claim for \ninvasion of privacy: (1) a legally protected privacy interest ; (2) a reasonable expectation of privacy \nunder the circumstances; and (3) a serious invasion of the privacy interest.  In re iPhone \nApplication Litig ., 844 F. Supp. 2d 1040, 1063 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (internal citation omitted).  SNSC \nagain challenges the third element of Schmitt’s claim.  \nThere is a “high bar” for pleading an invasion of privacy claim.  Low v. LinkedIn Corp ., \n900 F. Supp. 2d 1010, 1025 (N.D. Cal. 2012).  “Actionable invasions of privacy must be \nsufficiently serious in their nature, scope, and actual or potential impact to constitute an egregious  \nbreach of the social norms underlying the priva cy right.”  Hill v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Assn. , 7 \nCal. 4th 1, 37 (1994) (emphasis added).  “Even negligent conduct that leads to theft of highly \npersonal information, including Social Security numbers, does not approach the standard of \nactionable cond uct under the California Constitution and thus does not constitute a violation of \nplaintiffs’ right to privacy.”  iPhone Application Litig. , 844 F. Supp. 2d at 1063 (internal citation \nand quotation marks omitted).   \n SNSC argues that Schmitt again fails to  allege any egregious or intentional conduct.  Mot. \nto Dismiss (“MTD”) [Dkt. No. 35] 6:11 -12.  Rather, SNSC contends, Schmitt makes “barebones \nallegations” that she has the right to be “highly offended” by the disclosure of her personal Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 5 of 17 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  information, and th at the breach alone warrants  proceeding with this claim.  Id. at 6:11 -15.  SNSC \nargues that this does not amount to a serious invasion of privacy.  Id. at 6:15.   In support, SNSC \ncites two cases with similar allegations as those raised by Schmitt.  In one,  the court held that \n“[l]osing personal data through insufficient security doesn’t rise to the level of an egregious breach \nof social norms underlying the protection of sensitive data like Social Security numbers.”  Razuki \nv. Caliber Home Loans, Inc. , No. 17-CV-1718, 2018 WL 2761818, at *2 (S.D. Cal. June 8, 2018).  \nIn the other, the court dismissed an invasion of privacy claim because the plaintiff did not “allege \nany facts that would suggest that the data breach was an intentional violation of plaintiff’s  and \nother class members’ privacy, as opposed to merely a negligent one.”  Dugas v. Starwood Hotels \n& Resorts Worldwide, Inc. , No. 3:16 -CV-00014, 2016 WL 6523428, at *12 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 3, \n2016).  \n These cases are more on point  than the one cited by Schmitt , who argues that the  instant \ncircumstances are akin to the invasion of privacy that occurred in In re Facebook, Inc., Consumer \nPrivacy User Profile Litig. , 402 F. Supp. 3d 767 (N.D. Cal 2019).   See Oppo. to Mot. to Dismiss \n(“Oppo.”) [Dkt. No. 36] 16:19 -20.  In re Facebook  arose from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, \nalleging  that Facebook acted unlawfully by “making user information widely available to third \nparties” and “failing to do anything meaningful to prevent third parties from misusing the \ninformation they obtained.”  Id. at 777 -78.  According to Schmitt, “essentially the same conduct is \nalleged” here.  Oppo. at  16:24.   \n It is difficult to see how Schmitt draws this conclusion.  In re Facebook  involved \nFacebook’s alleged practice of intentionally sharing information about its users with a “non -\nexclusive list of business partners.”  In re Facebook , 402 F . Supp. 3d at 781.  In turn, those \ncompanies allegedly shared data with Facebook.  Id.  In addition, Facebook was accused of doing \nnothing to stop those  “business partners”  from misusing the user information that Facebook \nprovided.  Id.  In one instanc e—the Cambridge Analytica scandal that gave rise to the litigation —\na researcher gave the information that he obtained from Facebook to a British consulting firm, \nwhich then used personal information from millions of Facebook accounts to send targeted \npolitical  messages during the 2016 presidential campaign.  See id . at 777.  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 6 of 17 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   That is a far cry from the allegations at hand.  First, there is no indication of any intentional \nsharing of information by SNSC similar to that by Facebook.  Schmitt does not contend that SNSC \nwas in business with, purposefully shared consumers’ personal information with, or received data \nfrom the Unauthorized Party.  Schmitt claims that SNSC allowed access to consumers’ personal \ninformation by storing it in “a place where hackers would tar get and easily succeed in acquiring it \nas a result of SNSC’s unreasonable data security.”  Oppo. at 16:25 -27 (citing FAC at ¶ 25, 111).  \nBut procuring information via security breach is inherently different than obtaining it through a n \nagreed -upon exchange  between business partners , as alleged in In re Facebook .  See In re \nFacebook , 402 F. Supp. 3d at 781.   Schmitt repeatedly refers to the incident involving SNSC  as a \n“breach” and “attack,” underscoring this crucial difference.  See, e.g., FAC at ¶ 1, 14, 2 3, 107.   \nSchmitt also cites In re Facebook  in arguing that the “intimate details” regarding her and \nclass members was sufficiently sensitive to render the data breach an invasion of privacy .  Oppo. \nat 17:3 -10.  This argument also fails, as the compromise of any information resulted from alleged \nconduct that was (at most) negligent and not intentional.  See iPhone Application Litig. , 844 F. \nSupp. 2d at 106 3.  (“Even negligent conduct that leads to theft of highly personal information, \nincluding Social Security numbers, does not . . . constitute a violation of plaintiffs’ right to \nprivacy.”).   \n Because Schmitt  has not met the high bar for pleading invasion of privacy, I GRANT \nSNSC’s motion to dismiss the invasion of privacy claim  with prejudice.  \nII. UCL  \nThe UCL prohibits “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.”  Cal. Civ. \nCode § 17200.  Each prong provides a “separate and distinct theory of liability.”  Lozano v. AT&T \nWireless Servs., Inc. , 504 F.3d 718, 731 (9th Cir. 2007).  Schmitt  claims violations of two of the \nthree prongs, alleging unlawful and unfair actions by SNSC.  See FAC at ¶¶ 115 -122.   \nA. UNLAWFUL  \nThe unlawful prong of the UCL prohibits “anything that can properly be called a business \npractice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.”  In re Yahoo! Inc. Customer Data Sec. \nBreach Litig. , No. 16 -MD-02752 -LHK, 2017 WL 3727318, at *23  (N.D. Cal. A ug. 30, 2017)  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 7 of 17 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (citation omitted).  “By proscribing ‘any unlawful’ business practice, the UCL permits injured \nconsumers to ‘borrow’ violations of other laws and treat them as unlawful competition that is \nindependently actionable.”  Id.  However, the claim “must identify the particular section of the \nstatute that was violated , and must describe with reasonable particularity the facts supporting the \nviolation.”  Bros. v. Hewlett -Packard Co. , No. C -06-02254 -RMW, 2006 WL 3093685, at *7 (N.D. \nCal. Oct. 31, 2006) (internal citation omitted).  If a plaintiff cannot state a claim under the \n“borrowed” law, he or she  cannot state a UCL claim.  Golden v. Sound Inpatient Physicians Med. \nGrp., Inc., 93 F. Supp. 3d 1171, 1179 (E.D. Cal. 2015).  \nSchmitt alleges violations of  the FTC Act and of FTC “regulations, guidance, and \ndecisions” as grounds for her claim under the  UCL’s  unlawful prong.  FAC at ¶ 117  (citing in part \n15 U.S.C. § 45, et. seq .).  At oral argument, her counsel referenced a footnote in her brief that  \ncited a n electronic brochure published by the FTC, which was included in Schmitt’s Opposition \nbut not in her FAC.  See Oppo. at 18 n.3.   \nI previously held that because the FTC Act did not confer a private right of action, it could \nnot serve as a predicate for a UCL claim under the latter’s unlawful prong.  See First MTD Order \nat 16 -17 (“For purposes of alleging an unlawful business practice, plaintiffs cannot predicate their \nUCL claim on the FTC Act.”).  I thought that  O’Donnell v. Bank of Am., Nat. Ass’n , 504 Fe d. \nAppx. 566 (2013)  was more persuasive than the district court’s ruling in In re Anthem, Inc. Data \nBreach Litig. , 162 F. Supp. 3d 953 (N.D. Cal. 2016) , particularly because it came from the Ninth \nCircuit .  See First MTD Order at 16 -17.   \nNow, Schmitt cite s new cases supporting her argument that the FTC Act and guidelines \ncan provide the basis for a n unlawful UCL claim, the most compelling of which come from the \nNinth Circuit and the California Supreme Court.  See Oppo. at 20.  In Rubenstein v. Neiman \nMarcu s Grp. LLC , 687 Fed. Appx. 564, 567 (9th Cir. 2017), the court  held that “although the FTC \nGuides do not provide a private civil right of action, virtually any state, federal or local law can \nserve as the predicate for an action under the UCL.” (internal q uotation marks and citation \nomitted).  Although this contradicts O’Donnell , it too directly addresses the lack of the private \nright of action as it pertains to FTC guidelines and the UCL  and is later in time (though neither Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 8 of 17 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  case is precedential) .  It also aligns with the California Supreme Court’s decision in Rose v. Bank \nof America, N.A. , 57 Cal. 4th 390, 397 -98 (2013), which allowed UCL claims based on violations \nof the Truth in Savings Act, even though the statute’s private right of action for damages ha d been \nrepealed.  For those reasons, I agree with the reasoning in Rubenstein and Schmitt may predicate \nher UCL unlawful claim on the FTC Act and FTC guidelines.  \nThe problem , however, is that Schmitt again fails to plead violations of either the FTC Act \nor guidelines with the requisite particularity.   When alleging unlawful conduct, the FAC  predicate s \nher UCL claim on violations of the FTC Act or FTC regulations, guidance, and decisions.  See \nFAC at ¶ 117.  But Schmitt does not name which specific provisi on of the FTC Act was allegedly \nviolated, let alone how.  See id .  The same goes for the FTC guidelines.   Unlike in Rubenstein , \nwhere the plaintiffs alleged violations of specific FTC Guides (the Guides Against Deceptive \nPricing, 16 C ode of Federal Regulat ions Sections  233.1 and 233.2(c)), Schmitt only mentions \ngeneral FTC “guides” and “standards.”  See Rubenstein , 687 Fed. Appx. at 566; FAC at ¶¶ 37 -38, \n117.   \nThe footnote counsel mentioned does not save the claim.  It cites a n electronic  “guide for \nbusine ss” published by the FTC.  See Oppo. at 18 n.3  (linking to “Protecting Personal \nInformation: A Guide for Business”).   But the authority of this document is unclear.  It does not \nappear to cite to any federal regulations, as in Rubenstein .  See id.  It enco urages readers to “take \nstock of the law” and references three statutes that “may require you to provide reasonable \nsecurity for sensitive information,” but does not elaborate beyond providing a link to the FTC \nwebsite.  See id . at 6.  Moreover, the introd uction to the document describes it as a “brochure.”  Id. \nat 2.  There is no indication that this document constitutes a law or federal regulation , nor carries \nthe weight of such .  Without any argument from Schmitt showing this, this document cannot serve \nas a predicate for her unlawful UCL claim.  \nSchmitt also points to a Third Circuit case as well as SNSC’s Privacy Policy in arguing \nthat her allegations have the requisite particularity.  See Oppo. at 18 -19.  But neither resolve the \nongoing flaw in the plea dings: Schmitt has failed to (1) identify a particular section of the statute \n(in this case, the specific provision of the FTC Act or an FTC Guide); and (2) describe with any Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 9 of 17 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  particularity the facts supporting the purported violations of th at section.    \nAccordingly , I find that Schmitt has not adequately pleaded a violation of a statute giving \nrise to a claim under the unlawful prong of the UCL.   \nB. UNFAIR  \nThe unfair prong of the UCL creates a cause of action for a business practice that is unfair \neven if not proscribed by another law.  In re Yahoo! , 2017 WL 3727318, at *23 (citation omitted).  \nThe UCL does not define “unfair ,” and the “proper definition of ‘unfair’ conduct against \nconsumers ‘is currently in flux’ among California courts.”  Id.  Some courts apply what is referred \nto as the “tethering test,” where unfairness must “be tethered to some legislatively declared policy \nor proof of some actual or thr eatened impact on competition.”  Lozano , 504 F.3d at 735  (citation \nomitted) .  Others use the “balancing test,” which requires courts to “weigh the utility of the \ndefendant’s conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.”  Davis v. HSBC Ban k \nNevada, N.A. , 691 F.3d 1152, 1169 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs \n“may proceed with a UCL claim under the balancing test by either alleging immoral, unethical, \noppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious conduct by  defendants or by demonstrating \nthat defendants’ conduct violated an established public policy.”  In re Anthem , 162 F. Supp. 3d at \n990.  \nSNSC contends that Schmitt fails both tests .  First, SNSC asserts that because Schmitt has \nfailed to allege “any legiti mate violation of statutory law, there is no legislative policy” to which \nshe can tether her claim.  See MTD at 11:10 -18.  SNSC extends this argument to the first aspect of \nthe balancing test, again asserting  that Schmitt cannot show that SNSC violated an “clear, \nestablished public policy.”  Id. at 12:22 -13:12.  Regarding the second aspect  of the balancing test , \nSNSC asserts  that Schmitt has not alleged how the ransomware attack amounts to “immoral, \nunethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injur ious” acts, beyond “reciting the words” in \nthe FAC .  See id . at 12:14 -17.   \nTurning first to the tethering test, I agree  that Schmitt has not sufficiently pleaded a Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 10 of 17 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  violation of public policy.2  The FAC  contends that it is the “established public policy o f this state \nthat confidential information entrusted to financial institutions . . . be adequately protected from \noutside institutions.”  FAC at ¶ 116.  Schmitt also alleges that “SNSC’s practices were contrary to \nlegislatively declared and public policies  that seek to protect consumer data and ensure that \nentities who solicit or are entrusted with personal and financial data utilize appropriate security \nmeasures.”  Id.  \nSchmitt argues that these public policies are reflected  in the FTC Act, Section 1798.81.5 of \nthe California Civil Code, and Article I, Section 1 of the California Constitution .  See id.  But the \nFTC Act and cited section of the California Constitution make  no mention of personal  information \nor consumer data, nor the legislative intent behind either.  Cf. In re Adobe Sys., Inc. Privacy Litig ., \n66 F. Supp. 3d 1197, 1227 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (noting that “California legislative intent is clear” as \nto the cited sta tutes, allowing plaintiffs to adequately allege a claim under the UCL’s unfair \nprong); Diva Limousine, Ltd. v. Uber Techs., Inc. , 392 F. Supp. 3d. 1074, 1091 (N.D. Cal. 2019) \n(finding that plaintiffs adequately alleged a n unfair  UCL  claim because the Calif ornia Labor Code \n“expressly declares that ‘it is the policy of this state to vigorously enforce minimum labor \nstandards ’” relevant to the claim).  These provisions might in fact reflect the public policy that \nSchmitt alleges.  But she needs to draw a more direct line between the two in order to adequately \nallege that SNSC’s actions violated any public policy.  \nSection 1798.81.5 (a)(1) of the California Civil Code  expressly  declares  the Legislature’s \nintent to protect personal information .  As I have previousl y stated, however, case law indicates \nthat this section  only appl ies to California residents, suggesting that any associated public policy \nmay be similarly limited.  See First MTD Order at 17  (citing In re Sony Gaming Networks & \nCustomer Data Sec. Breach L itig., 903 F. Supp. 2d 942, 973 (S.D. Cal. 2012) ; see also  Cal. Civ. \nCode  § 1798.81.5(a)(1) (“It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure that personal information \nabout California residents is protected.”)  (emphasis added).  Schmitt does not argue otherwise.  \nThat said , I find that Schmitt  has plausibly  alleged “immoral, unethical, oppressive, \n \n2 Schmitt did not allege any actual or threatened impact on competition by SNSC.  See FAC at ¶¶ \n116-122. Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 11 of 17 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  unscrupulous or substantially injurious ” conduct by defendants , satisfying the balancing test at this \nstage of the litigation .  In re Anthem , 162 F. Supp. 3d at 990.  The FAC offers sufficient facts to \nallege this type of conduct, in part by claiming that SNSC represented in its Privacy Policy that “to \nprotect . . . personal information from unauthorized access and use” it used security measures \nincluding “computer safeguards, secured files and buildings ,” but knowingly failed to employ \nadequate safeguards.  See FAC at ¶ 119 ; Ex. A .  While I agree with SNSC that its own Privacy \nPolicy does not carry the same weight as a legislatively declared publi c policy, the key is that \nSNSC represented to customers that it would protect their personal information despite knowing, \naccording to Schmitt, that it had inadequate safeguards in place.   See Reply  [Dkt. No. 37]  5:25-27.  \nMoreover, Schmitt alleges that SN SC’s conduct was “immoral, unethical, oppressive, \nunscrupulous, unconscionable, and/or substantially injurious” when it failed to disclose the data \nbreach in a timely manner, now pleading that SNSC had a duty to so.  See, e.g. , FAC at ¶ 118.  \nTherefore , based on the balancing test, I find that Schmitt has sufficiently stated a claim under the \nunfair prong of the UCL.  \nFor these reasons, SNSC’s motion to dismiss is DENIED with respect to the claim brought \nunder the unfair prong of the UCL.  It is GRANTED on t he claim brought under the unlawful \nprong, with leave to amend.  \nIII. NEGLIGENCE  \nTo state a claim for negligence in California, a plaintiff must show duty, breach, causation, \nand damages.  Conroy v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. , 45 Cal. 4th 1244, 1 250 (2009).   \nA. PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION  \nAs an initial matter, in my prior Order, I held that Schmitt failed to adequately assert that \npersonal identifying information (“PII”) was among the information compromised during the data \nbreach —and thus, could not show that SNSC had a duty to protect that information.  First MTD \nOrder at 8:16 -19.  I stated that Schmitt could show this by “pleading what kind of information \n[she], and customers like [her], provided to SNSC.”  Id. at 8:19 -20.  “With allegations that certain \nless sensitive information was released during the data breach . . . and that SNS C at least had in its \npossession other more sensitive information (which rise to the level of PII), a reasonable inference Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 12 of 17 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  could be drawn that PII was also among the information compromised.”  Id. at 8:20 -24. \nSNSC asserts that Schmitt has again failed to d o this.  See MTD at 14.  SNSC relies \nheavily on the language of the Notice sent to customers , which it argues makes “abundantly clear \nthat plaintiff has no case because none of her PII was accessed and compromised.”  Id. at 14:11 -\n16.  SNSC cites excerpts, including:  \n \n• SNSC is “not aware of the misuse of any of your information. . . .”  \n• “[N]one of the information that was compromised included credit card information, or \nbanking account information. . . .”  \n• “The information compromised was largely limited to Mar ch 2018 Billing Statements \nand fee notices. . . .”  \n• “[Y]ou will be notified in the event we discover that any . . . personally identifiable \ninformation (‘PII’) pertaining to you was exposed.”  \n \nId. at 14 (citing FAC, Ex. B).   \nSchmitt responds by arguing  that she adequately amended her Complaint to include  the \ntypes of information about Schmitt and class members that SNSC possessed  at the time of the \nbreach .  See Oppo. at 7 :11-18.  She first cites SNSC’s Privacy Policy, which states that SNSC \ncollects and sha res information that can include Social Security numbers and account balances, \ntransaction and credit histories, credit scores , and mortgage rates and payments.  See Oppo. at \n7:12-15 (citing  FAC at ¶ 12).  Schmitt adds to this list later in the FAC, allegi ng that she and class \nmembers “provided their lenders, servicers, and SNSC with significant personal, income, and \nfinancial information that SNSC was able to acquire and to supplement by obtaining credit reports \nand banking information from third parties.”   Id. at ¶ 63.  That  information,  Schmitt asserts, \nincludes Social Security numbers, full names , property and insurance details, loan history \ninformation, and tax and credit information.  See id . \nIn deciding whether a plaintiff has stated a claim upon whic h relief can be granted, I must \naccept her allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor.  See Usher , 828 F.2d \nat 561.  California law recognizes the disclosure of a person’s name and Social Security number as \nthe disclosure of PII.  See Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.81.5(d)(1)(A)(i).  Schmitt proffers enough factual \nallegations —including SNSC’s own Privacy Policy —to reasonably infer that SNSC had Social Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 13 of 17 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Security numbers in its possession when the breach occurred.  See FAC at ¶¶ 12, 63.  This \nallegation is also supported by the supplemental disclosure sent to class members, stating that the \nUnauthorized Party “may have had access” to names, contact information, birthdates, Social \nSecurity numbers, and “loan/borrower information” during the data  breach.  Id. at ¶ 30 (citing Ex. \nC).  Although Schmitt did not receive the letter,  she notes that this lawsuit was pending at the time \nit was distributed.  Id. at ¶ 66.  Drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor, I find that Schmitt \nhas sufficiently pleaded that the information compromised in the data breach included PII.  \nB. DUTY OF CARE  \nCalifornia courts consider several factors when determining the existence of a legal duty.  \nThe “ Rowland  factors” include: (1) the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff; (2) the degree of \ncertainty that the plaintiff suffered injury; (3) the closeness of the connection between the \ndefendant’s conduct and the injury suffered; (4) the moral blame attached to  the defendant’s \nconduct; (5) the policy of preventing future harm; (6) the extent of the burden to the defendant and \nconsequences to the community of imposing a duty; and (7) the availability, cost, and prevalence \nof insurance for the risk involved.  Rege nts of Univ. of Cal. v. Superior Court , 4 Cal. 5th 607, 628 \n(2018).  The Regents  court noted that these factors fall into two categories: one involving \n“foreseeability and the related concepts of certainty and the connection between plaintiff and \ndefendant ,” and the other examining “public policy concerns of moral blame, preventing future \nharm, burden, and insurance availability.”  Id. at 629.  The court also noted that the factors “must \nbe evaluated at a relatively broad level of factual generality.”  Id. at 628 . \ni. Foreseeability Factors  \nSNSC argues that the first Rowland  factor is not met because Schmitt’s alleged harm —\n“expenses and/or time spent on credit monitoring” —was not foreseeable.  MTD at 15:14 -16 \n(citing FAC at ¶ 109).  SNSC describes the Schmitt’s actions as “entirely unnecessary” and \n“voluntary,” arguing that because her PII was not accessed or misused, there was no need for her \nto spend time or money monitoring her credit .  See id . at 15:16 -24.  SNSC cites the Notice  as \naffirming that Schmitt’s PI I was not access ed or misused, along with the supplemental disclosure \nin arguing that SNSC offered “complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft services” to Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 14 of 17 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  affected individuals.  Id. at 1 5:18-26 (citing FAC, Exs. B, C).  The latter, SNSC argues, fu rther \nshows there was “no reason to incur this ‘harm.’”  Id. at 1 5:19. \nAs Schmitt argues, this ignores the language of the Notice  itself.  See Oppo. at 10:26 -11:9.  \nIn the letter, SNSC encouraged recipients to “remain vigilant over [the] next twelve (12) t o \ntwenty -four (24) months, review your account statements and immediately report any suspicious \nactivity.”  See FAC , Ex. B.  It also recommended that recipients “regularly obtain credit reports \nfrom each nationwide credit reporting agency.”  Id.  SNSC’s ar gument that its own \nrecommendations were not foreseeable is not persuasive.  \nSNSC summarily challenges the second and third Rowland  factors —the degree of certainty \nthat Schmitt suffered injury and closeness of the connection  between SNSC’s conduct and the \nalleged injury —on the same grounds .  See MTD at 16:1 -7.  However, as explained  below , the \nmoney and time Schmitt spent monitoring her credit constitutes a sufficient injury for her claims \nto proceed.  She also adequately all eges that her injury is closely connected to SNSC’s purported \nfailure to protect the personal information of Schmitt and other class members, along with its \nrecommendation that customer s monitor their credit.  See Oppo. at 11:18 -24.  \nii. Policy Factors  \nTurning  to the policy -related factors, SNSC first argues that there is “no moral blame to \nattach to SNSC,” particularly when the ransomware attack and purported harm to Schmitt was not \nforeseeable.  See MTD at 16:9 -11.  In support, SNSC cites Castillo v. Seagate Tech., LLC , No. 16 -\nCV-01958 -RS, 2016 WL 9280242, at *6 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 14, 2016), which analyzed moral \nblameworthiness under the economic loss doctrine.  In Castillo , the court held that the plaintiffs \nfailed to adequately plead that the defendant’s actio ns were immoral because they had not \n“provided enough information to permit an inference that [the defendant] should have been on the \nlookout for fraudulent requests for W -2 information.”  See id .  Without “reckless or purposeful \nbehavior,” SNSC argues, “n o moral blame can attach.”  See MTD at 16:17 -18 (citing Castillo , \n2016 WL 9280242, at *6 ). \nBut Castillo  is distinguishable.  The Castillo plaintiffs alleged that the defendant owed \nthem a duty to “protect their personal identifying information and to infor m them reasonably Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 15 of 17 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  promptly about the phishing attack.”  See Castillo , 2016 WL 9280242, at *2.   Schmitt takes issue \nwith SNSC’s  purported mis representations in its Privacy  Policy, along with the delayed \nnotification to customers  after the data breach was di scovered.  Oppo. at 11-12; see also  FAC at ¶ \n105-106 (alleging “reckless disregard” by SNSC).  And while  the Castillo  plaintiff were informed \nof the breach either “a few days” or “about a week” after it occurred, Schmitt alleges she was not \nnotified for th ree months.  See Castillo , 2016 WL 9280242, at *1; FAC at ¶ 19.   \nI also find that the policy of preventing future harm favors  imposing  a duty of care, as it \nwould strengthen information security for customers like Schmitt, who entrust companies like \nSNSC  with their PII  and, in the event that something goes awry, expect prompt notification.  See \nOppo. at 12 -13.  Again, SNSC cites a  distin guishable  case when  arguing otherwise.  See MTD at \n16:26 -17:6.  It is true that the  court in Sakai v. Massco Invs. , LLC , 20 Cal. App. 5th 1178, 1189 -90 \n(2018), decline d to find liability for harm caused by a third party “as a matter of policy ,” citing in \npart the “onerous” burden of implementing preventative measures.   But that case involved \nmarkedly different circumstances , arising after a taco truck customer was struck  by a vehicle in a \ngas station parking lot.  See id . at 1181 -82.  Any burden imposed on SNSC to strengthen its \nsecurity measures or speed up  its notification processes would be incurred by a large company, not \nthe owner of a gas station .  See MTD at 17:7 -15.  The benefits would also reach a wider audience.  \nSchmitt has adequately alleged that any burden would be outweighed by the “significant” benefits \nof reducing “ identity fraud, phishing, and social engineering schemes ,” as well as lessening the \nrisks of c ustomers’ identity theft and fraud.  See Oppo . at 13:7 -15.  Although the parties disagree \nas to the expense and availability of insurance, the final Rowland  factor, it is not dispositive, as the \nremaining factors all weigh in favor of imposing a duty of ca se. \n For these reasons, I find that Schmitt has adequately alleged that SNSC had a duty of care \nto protect her PII.3 \n \n \n3 Schmitt also contends in her Opposition that SNSC had a duty of case based on a special \nrelationship, because it created the peril , and under the doctrine of negligence per se.  See Oppo. at \n8-9.  Because I find that Schmitt has adequately pleaded a duty of care under the Rowland  factors, \nI need not evaluate the duty in these other contexts.  Case 3:21-cv-03355-WHO   Document 40   Filed 11/12/21   Page 16 of 17 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  C. BREACH  \nSNSC does not challenge breach in its Motion to Dismiss.  I previously noted that if \nSchmitt were to adequately allege a plausible  legal duty, the burden to plead a corresponding \nbreach based on SNSC’s inadequate security measures was “not high .”  See First MTD Order at \n8:26-28.  Because Schmitt has adequately alleged a duty, I see no issue with breach .   \nD. CAUSATION AND DAMAGES  \nSNSC challenges causation and damages with familiar arguments.  It argues that Schmitt \n“does not make the requisite connection between the alleged breach and [her]  damages” because \nshe does not assert that: “(1) her PII was actually stolen and misused, (2)  she was a victim of \nidentity theft or fraud, and (3) she did not suffer identify theft or fraud prior to this incident.”  See \nMTD at 18:15 -18. \nThese arguments have been settled.  As stated in my prior Order, recent case law makes \nclear that “time and mone y” a plaintiff spends on credit monitoring in response to a data breach “is \ncognizable harm to support [a] negligence claim.”  See First MTD Order at 10 (citing Huynh v. \nQuora, Inc. , 508 F. Supp. 3d 633, 649 -50 (N.D. Cal 2020) and other cases).  Schmitt ha s clearly \nasserted plausible damages under existing law.  \nIn my prior Order, I also noted that if Schmitt were to plausibly plead that her PII was \ncompromised, “a reasonable inference would follow  that [her] decision to purchase monitoring \nservices was ‘rea sonable’ and ‘necessary.’”  See First MTD Order at 12:1 -2.  As explained above, \nSchmitt has done this.  Again, I see no reason to depart from my earlier thinking.  \nGiven these considerations, I find that Schmitt has sufficiently pleaded a claim for \nnegligen ce.  Accordingly , SNSC’s motion is DENIED on this claim.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, SNSC’s Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED \nin part, with leave to amend  in twenty days . \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  November 12, 2021  \nWilliam H.

    "summary": "1. Summary: In this case, DaJovan Pettit sued Allina Health System for racial discrimination where she alleged that she experienced explicit racist actions in her employment. Her attorney, Richard Hechter, filed complaints containing copied allegations from a different case, which led the Court to impose sanctions on him and his law firm. While AI was not directly involved in the case facts or claims, the defense argued that the use of templates in legal work, possibly facilitated by AI, should reduce the costs of filing such motions, contesting the fee amount claimed by the defendant.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: The primary legal issue is whether the behavior of Ms. Pettit's counsel, Richard Hechter, in making factually unsupported allegations and failing to handle the discovery process appropriately, warrants sanctions under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court granted Allina's motion for sanctions under Rule 11, ordering Hechter and his law firm to pay Allina $10,000 towards legal fees and recommended dismissing Pettit's claims with prejudice. Additionally, Hechter was ordered to pay $9,752.50 in costs related to Allina's motion to compel, due to his failure to comply with discovery obligations.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: A woman, Ms. Pettit, sued her former employer, Allina, for racial discrimination. Her lawyer made a big mistake by copying another lawyer’s work from a different case, putting false accusations in the complaint about things that did not happen to her. Because of this, the judge decided that the lawyer and his law firm should pay a fine to the employer for causing unnecessary trouble and expenses, and the case should not continue. The court also noted that cheaper legal motion costs should be expected because lawyers use technology and pre-made templates.",
    "full_text": "1 \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nDISTRICT OF MINNESOTA  \n \n \nDaJovan Pettit,  \n \n   Plaintiff, \n v. \n Allina Health System,  \n \n   Defendant. \n  \nCase No. 23-cv-2789 (JWB/JFD) \n \n \n \nORDER AND  \nREPORT & RECOMMENDATION \n \n \nBefore the Court is Defendant Allina Health System’s (“Allina”) Motion for \nAttorneys’ Fees (Dkt. No. 72) incurred in connection with its Motion to Compel (Dkt. \nNo. 58) and Allina’s Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions (Dkt. No. 91) against Plaintiff’s attorney, Richard Hechter, and Mr. Hechter’s firm, Morris Law Group, P.A. (“MLG”). The \nCourt finds that neither Mr. Hechter’s health nor staffing issues at his law firm excuse hi s \nconduct of responding to legitimate discovery responses two months late, only responding  \nafter a motion to compel was filed, and ignoring multiple communications from opposing counsel. The Court therefore orders Mr. Hechter and his law firm to pay Allina $9,752.50 in costs and attorneys’ fees in connection with Allina’s Motion to Compel.   \nThe Court also finds Allina’s request for Rule 11 sanctions justified and \nrecommends dismissal with prejudice of Ms. Pettit’s claims in their entirety as well as monetary sanctions against Ms. Pettit’s counsel and his firm as sanctions for serious contraventions of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 (“Rule 11”).The Court finds that Mr. Hechter filed a \ncomplaint in this case that was actually a complaint filed by another lawyer in another CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 1 of 262 \n employment discrimination case against Allina, ignored Ms. Pettit when she stated the \nComplaint was inaccurate and needed to be changed, and then tried to blame Ms. Pettit for the Complaint’s falsity.  \nThe Court rejects Allina’s request that Ms. Pettit, personally, be sanctioned. At \nmultiple points in this litigation, Allina’s counsel has sought sanctions against Ms. Pettit directly, a tactic which the Court cannot describe as anything but cruel. Ms. Pettit is a \nmember of the public who came to court seeking relief for what she sincerely saw, perhaps  \nincorrectly, as redressable injury. In seeking sanctions against Ms. Pettit personally for the \nmisbehavior of her attorney, Allina’s counsel has crossed the line separating zealous \nadvocacy on behalf of a client from mere bullying. While in some cases sanctions against a party for the misdeeds of their attorney may be warranted, that is not the case here. Ms. \nPettit is a working -class layperson who made a poor choice of lawyer. She told that lawyer \nthat the complaint he had filed on her behalf was incorrect and needed to be amended, but \nshe was ignored. This Court cannot require anything further of her and will not punish her financially for her lawyer’s conduct.   \nINTRODUCTION  \nMs. Pettit commenced this action in September 2023, alleging racial discrimination \nagainst Allina, where she was employed between 2012 and 2021. (Dkt. No. 6 ¶¶ 1–17.) \nThe complaint was filed and signed by her attorney, Richard Hechter, on September 11, 2023. (See Compl., Dkt. No. 1.) In her complaint, Ms. Pettit alleged, among other things, \nthat she endured a wide variety of despicable, explicitly racist actions, including racial CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 2 of 263 \n slurs, directed at her by supervisors and other employees at Allina.1 (See e.g. Compl. ¶¶ \n55–127, Dkt. No. 1.) The supervisors were identified by name in the Complaint. These \nallegations persisted in Ms. Pettit’s Amended Complaint, filed February 2, 2024. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 55, 58, 62 –133, Dkt. No. 25.) The February 2, 2024 amended complaint is the \noperative complaint for these motions.  \nI. Allina’s Motion for \n Attorneys’ Fees Regarding its Motion to Compel \nDiscovery  \n \nFirst, the Court address es Allina’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees Regarding its Motion \nto Compel Discovery. (Dkt. No. 72.) This is a non- dispositive motion that the Court \nresolves via Order. See D. Minn. LR 72.2(a).  \nA. Background \nOn March 20, 2024, Allina served Ms. Pettit with its First Set of Interrogatories, \nFirst Set of Requests for Production, and a Notice of Deposition of Ms. Pettit herself. (Dkt. \nNo. 59 at 3.) Ms. Pettit’s responses to the subject discovery were thus due by April 19, 2024. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30, 33, 34.  \nWhen no responses were received by the due date, Allina’s counsel reached out to \nMs. Pettit’s counsel on April 25, 2024, seeking an update. (Dkt. No. 59 at 3.) Plaintiff’s counsel then requested an extension of time to May 6, 2024. Allina’s counsel agreed, but \nnoted that Ms. Pettit’s deposition, originally scheduled for May 23, 2024, would need to \n \n1 The Court sees no value in describing in any detail the language Ms. Pettit’s complaint \nalleges, other than that it includes some of the viler words used to refer to Black Americans.  CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 3 of 264 \n be rescheduled. (Id.) Allina’s request for alternative deposition dates went unanswered. \n(Id.)  \nIn addition, according to the Court’s Pretrial Scheduling Order, all pre-discovery \ndisclosures were required by May 1, 2024. (Pretrial Scheduling Order 1, Dkt. No. 55.) \nWhen no disclosures were received by the deadline, Allina’s counsel again reached out to \nMr. Hechter on May 2 and May 7, 2024, to remind him. (Dkt. No. 59 at 4.) As of May 7, 2024, Ms. Pettit, through counsel, had neither responded to discovery requests nor provided the required initial disclosures, nor had she proposed new dates for her deposition as properly noticed. \nOn May 9, 2024, Allina’s counsel made multiple attempts to contact Mr. Hechter \nby phone, only to encounter technical issues. (Id. at 5.) The  next day , Allina requested an \ninformal discovery teleconference with the Court, but this required agreement from all \nparties and Mr. Hechter did not reply to Allina’s counsel’s emails on the subject. (Id.) \nAllina’s counsel sent a letter on May 15, 2024, by email and U.S. Mail, warning Mr. \nHechter that a motion to compel would be filed unless a response was received by 5:00 PM \nthe next day. (Id.) When no response was received , Allina informed  the Court that it \nintended to move to compel. (Id. ) Despite further emails involving the Court over the next \nfew days regarding scheduling, Mr. Hechter still did not engage. (Id.) The Court scheduled \na hearing on Allina’s motion to compel for June 27, 2024.  (Dkt. No. 57.) \nMs. Pettit eventually served discovery responses on Allina on June 11 and 12, 2024, \n53 days after they were due and one week after Allina filed its motion to compel. (Dkt. No. \n76 at 1.) On June 13, 2024, Mr. Hechter filed a response to the motion to compel, advised  CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 4 of 265 \n the Court that he had complied with discovery, and requested that the motion be stricken \nor stayed. (Dkt. No. 63 at 1–2.) \nIn a June 23, 2024 email the Court asked counsel for the parties whether there was \nstill a need for the hearing on the motion to compel. (Dkt. No. 76 at 7.) Allina responded, \nstating that it believed the hearing was “still necessary” and requested leave to file a short \nreply, which the Court granted. Mr. Hechter did not seek leave to file a response, and \ninstead emailed the Court Ms. Pettit’s discovery answers and later her supplemental discovery answers as well. In response, the Court issued an order, dated June 25, 2024, reminding counsel that  in federal court: “Discovery documents are only to be filed when \nthe Court orders them filed or when they are used in the proceeding. These documents were not requested by the Court . . . [and thus] will not be read.” (Dkt. No. 68.) \nOn June 27, 2024, the Court held a hearing on Allina’s motion to compel as \nscheduled. Mr. Hechter explained in court that the delay in responding to Allina’s discovery requests was due to staffing issues at his firm and the need for thoroughness in gathering information dating back to 2018. ( See Dkt. No. 76 at 1– 2.) Additionally, Mr. \nHechter was briefly unavailable due to a skin cancer diagnosis and related surgery on May 31, 2024. ( Id. at 2.) \nAt the hearing, the Court found that the circumstances did not justify Ms. Pettit’s \nfailure to comply with her discovery obligations and granted Allina’s motion to compel. (See Dkt. No. 69.) The Court now considers Allina’s request for attorneys’ fees incurred in \nconnection with the motion. (Dkt. No. 72.) \n  CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 5 of 266 \n B. Legal Standard \nIf a motion to compel is granted, “the court must, after giving an opportunity to be \nheard, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the motion, the party or \nattorney advising that conduct, or both to pay the movant’s reasonable expenses in curred \nin making the motion, including attorney’s fees,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(A), unless “the movant filed the motion before attempting in good faith to obtain the disclosure or discovery without court action,” “the opposing party’s nondisclosure, response, or objection was substantially justified,” or “other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(A)(i)–(iii). \nThe amount of fees “must be determined on the facts of each case, and the district \ncourt has wide discretion in making this determination.” Safelite Grp., Inc. v. Rothman, \n759 F. App’x 533, 535 (8th Cir. 2019) (quoting Rogers v. Kelly, 866 F.2d 997, 1001 (8th \nCir. 1989)). To determine the amount of a reasonable fee award, the Court begins by \nmultiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by hourly rates the Court finds to be \nreasonable. See Fish v. St. Cloud State Univ., 295 F.3d 849, 851 (8th Cir. 2002) (quoting \nHensley v. Eckerhart , 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983)).  \nThe party seeking fees is responsible for providing evidence of hours worked and \nthe rate claimed. Wheeler v. Mo. Highway & Transp. Comm’n, 348 F.3d 744, 754 (8th Cir. \n2003). A reasonable hourly rate is calculated based on the attorney’s regular hourly rates \nas well as the prevailing market rates in the community. Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 896 (1984). In determining a reasonable hourly rate, the Court may consider the skill of CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 6 of 267 \n representation, difficulty of work performed, counsel’s experience, and counsel’s \nreputation. Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433. \nC. Discussion \nAllina seeks $395.00 per hour for the services of attorney Holly M. Robbins, a \npartner at the law firm of Littler Mendelson with more than 29 years of experience, and $290.00 per hour for the services of attorneys Lehoan T. Pham and Stephanie A. Huisman, associates at the same law firm with 9 and 2 years of experience, respectively. (Dkt. No. 72 at 2–3.) Mr. Pham attests that these rates are reasonable. (Id.) The record does not provide substantial evidence of the prevailing rates in the community for attorneys with similar experience and reputation. However, based upon its independent knowledge of the prevailing rates, the Court concludes that the requested rates are reasonable for attorneys \nspecializing in employment litigation defending a case of alleged race-based job discrimination. The Court notes that the unpleasant allegations in this case risked not just the client’s money, as is true in all civil cases, but also presented a risk of reputational injury Considering the nature of the case, the Court’s observation of counsel’s written and oral work product, the number of years of experience of the lawyers involved, and the difficulty of the work, the Court finds that the requested hourly rates are reasonable. \nIn support of its fee petition, Allina also submitted summaries of the work its \nattorneys performed in connection with the motion to compel.\n2 (Dkt. Nos. 72 at 1, 75-1, \n \n2  Allina notes that the publicly available versions of the supporting exhibits have the \n“description” column redacted, but that it is prepared to file unredacted version s for the \nCourt’s in camera review, if necessary. (Dkt. No. 72 at 1.) CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 7 of 268 \n 75-2.) It seeks an award of fees of $9,752.50, including 4.5 hours of Ms. Robins’s time at \nthe rate of $395.00 per hour and 5.7 hours of Mr. Pham’s time and 1.8 hours of Ms. Huisman’s time, both at the rate of $290.00 per hour. \nPlaintiff is not challenging the sufficiency of Allina’s billing records. Plaintiff \nsimply notes that: “With the advent of word processing and even [artificial intelligence] and brief banks at large firms, motions to compel are largely templated. Plaintiff and her counsel [cannot] afford to pay $10,000.00 in fees for this motion to compel.” (Dkt. No. 76 at 3.) \nPlaintiff asserts that the Court must not order fees or costs when an “opposing \nparty’s nondisclosure, response, or objection was substantially justified” or “other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust.” (Dkt. No. 76 at 3 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 37(a)(5)(A)(ii), (iii)).) More specifically, plaintiff’s counsel maintains that: \nImposing a $10,000.00 sanction would likely cost Plaintiff the ability to \nhave her day in court. It is beyond what can be paid. The case has merit[,] \nand Plaintiff has just noticed a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition with requests for \nproduction of documents. Imposing a high sanction with no bad faith or continued failure of disregarding a court order would not be just and reasonable in this case. \n(Dkt. No.  76 at 4.) The Court finds little of this to be true. While more will be said in the \ndiscussion of the Rule 11 sanctions, it is not the sanction that has cost Ms. Pettit “her day \nin court,” but the Complaint that Mr. Hechter cut-and -pasted, when even superficial \nexamination would have showed that the facts alleged were not true, and in disregard of \nwarnings from Ms. Pettit about the complaint’s misstatements.  For example, the \nComplaint (and the Amended Complaint) allege that specific Allina supervisors, identified CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 8 of 269 \n by name, used racial slurs. These persons did not supervise Ms. Pettit (though they did \nsupervise the plaintiff in the case from which Mr. Hechter borrowed) and at her deposition Ms. Pettit testified that she had never heard these identified supervisors use this language. In short, the Court disagrees with Mr. Hechter that “the case has merit.” Since the case has \nno merit, it is of no moment that a 30(b)(6) deposition has been noticed, or that documents \nhave been requested. In support of his argument against sanctions, Mr. Hechter provides no authorities or verified facts, just Mr. Hechter’s word, the veracity of which, as discussed \nbelow, Mr. Hechter has unfortunately given the Court reason to doubt. (See id.) \nConsistent with its oral Order on Allina’s Motion to Compel, (See  Dkt. No. 69) the \nCourt does not find Mr. Hechter’s failure  to serve timely disclosures and discovery \nresponses justified on these facts. Mr. Hechter has failed to show that these circumstances \nmake an award of attorneys’ fees unjust. Mr. Hechter’s staffing and personal health issues \ndid not excuse his actions in failing to serve timely discovery responses for almost two months, ignoring opposing counsel’s repeated attempts to meet and confer, and failing to \nbring his health to the Court’s attention before the hearing on Allina’s Motion to Compel. “Plaintiff’s counsel had an ethical duty to handle this case properly and effectively,” and if he could not do so, regardless of the reason, “it was incumbent upon Plaintiff’s counsel to file a timely and appropriate motion for appropriate relief such as a motion to withdraw or \nto advise his client to obtain co-counsel or substitute counsel.” Landfall 2, Inc. v. \nDatascore- Ai, LLC, No. 22-CV-80801,  2022 WL 17815491, at *6 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 15, \n2022); Minn. R. of Pro. Conduct 1.3, cmt. 5 (“To prevent neglect of client matters …, the duty of diligence may require … a plan, … that designates another competent lawyer to CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 9 of 2610 \n review client files, notify each client of the lawyer’s death or disability, and determine \nwhether there is a need for immediate protective action.”). \nIn short, the Court finds that Mr. Hechter ’s failure to comply with discovery \nobligations that were legitimately a part of representing his client, including meeting Court-\nordered deadlines, was not substantially justified and that no circumstances exist that would \nmake an award of expenses unjust. The Court has worked with counsel who have staffing difficulties and with counsel who have health issues to craft litigation plans that allow cases \nto proceed. In this case, though, staffing and health issues were not even mentioned until the Court was considering sanctions because the discovery was nearly two months late with \nno explanation. The Court, however sympathetic it is to counsel’s staffing and personal \nhealth issues, cannot ignore the unjustified dilatory conduct throughout the discovery \nprocess in this case. \nCourts at times adjust the amount that is the product of reasonable hours worked \nmultiplied by reasonable fees charged. In this case, that is not necessary, because of \nAllina’s counsel’s attestation that there were “multiple entries that Allina would have a \ngood faith basis to seek recovery for as part of this Fee Petition,” but that it chose not to include in its petition in light of the Court’s observations of the mitigating circumstances—as discussed at the motion hearing. (Dkt. No. 72 at 4.) The excluded entries include \nAttorney Lehoan T. Pham’s travel time to and from the courthouse for the oral argument, \n“the majority” of his time spent reviewing and revising the motion papers, and “the majority” of his time reviewing the underlying discovery responses. (Id.) Those entries CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 10 of 2611 \n certainly appear relevant to Allina’s prosecution of its motion to compel, none of which \nwould have been incurred had Ms. Pettit’s counsel carefully observed his ethical duty. \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that an award of attorneys’ fees in the amount of \n$9,752.50—which is based on reasonable hours at reasonable rates, and which already \nreflects a discount based on mitigating circumstances— is reasonable in this case. This \naward is based on Allina’s Motion for Attorneys’ Fees (Dkt. No. 72) alone. The Court recommends additional and separate sanctions for violations of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 below. \nII. Allina’s Motion for Sanctions under Rule 11 \nOur system of justice is not self-applying; it takes individuals specially \nskilled and trained in fashioning and presenting legal arguments. … [S]ociety \nhas entrusted the legal profession with the unique privilege of representing \nthe rights of others and in applying the judicial machinery to individual cases. \nWith this unique privilege comes the uncompromisable responsibility for lawyers to conduct themselves in such a manner so as to maintain the \nintegrity of and public confidence in the legal system. The success of our \nsystem of justice requires that people have faith that justice can be obtained.  \nPublic confidence in law and lawyers may be eroded by irresponsible or \nimproper conduct of a lawyer. \n \nEsser v. A. H. Robins Co., 537 F. Supp. 197, 202–03 (D. Minn. 1982) (emphasis added) \n(internal quotations omitted). Attorney diligence, integrity, and compliance with the \nprocedural and ethical rules of the profession are fundamental to a civil justice system whose decisions will be accepted as legitimate.   \nUnfortunately, in addition to the extensive litigation and admonishments from the \nCourt over failures to comply with the rules and orders pertaining to discovery in this case, Ms. Pettit’s counsel, Mr. Hechter, failed to meet the obligations set forth in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Minnesota Rules of Professional Conduct. Mr. Hechter CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 11 of 2612 \n misrepresented the facts of this case to the Court in two separate certified complaints, \nmisrepresented those filings to his client, and attempted to blame his client for his own behavior. Rule 11 sanctions are justified and should be imposed against Mr. Hechter.  \nA. Background \nRichard Hechter is an attorney at Morris Law Group, P.A. in Edina, MN and has \npracticed under Minnesota Attorney License No. 193537 since 1988.\n3 The website of his \nlaw firm, MLG, states that he primarily practices in the areas of family law, personal injury, \nand medical malpractice and that he “is an accomplished and skilled litigator who has spent the last 30 years being widely recognized across Minnesota for his integrity, loyalty, and steadfast knowledge of state and federal law.” Morris Law Group, Richard Hechter, https://www.morrislawmn.com/richard-hechter/  (last visited Nov. 20, 2024).  \nMr. Hechter’s sanctionable behavior in this case started shortly after he agreed to \ntake Ms. Pettit’s case. In drafting Ms. Pettit’s complaint, he copied entire portions of the complaint in another case verbatim and passed it off as Ms. Pettit’s own pleading. Copying a pleading is not per se  a violation of Rule 11. In cases with the same or similar facts this \nis efficient. Here, however, Mr. Hechter copied portions of the previous complaint that made factual allegations that simply did not reflect Ms. Pettit’s experiences, knowledge, and claims.  \nThe complaint that was copied came from the case of Desmond Fielding v. Allina \nHealth System, 21-cv- 01407 DWF/DTS, (D. Minn.) (the “Fielding Complaint”). Mr. \n \n3 This information was obtained from the Minnesota Judicial Branch attorney license \ndatabase at https://mars.courts.state.mn.us/AttorneyDetail.aspx?attyID=0193537 .  CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 12 of 2613 \n Fielding also alleged racial discrimination by Allina, and his complaint detailed statements \nand experiences he alleged he had been subjected to at Allina, including racial slurs. (See Fielding Complaint.) As Allina states, Ms. Pettit’s complaint “took the most charged \nallegations from the Fielding Complaint … and then falsely passed off Fielding’s \nallegations as Pettit’s experiences.” (Def.’s Mot. for Sanctions 3, Dkt. No. 93.) Mr. Hechter \nfiled both Ms. Pettit’s original and amended complaints, both of which included false \nstatements about her experiences, without reviewing it in detail with her, even after Ms. Pettit advised him that it needed additional editing.\n4  \nIf this behavior was not enough, Mr. Hechter’s response to Allina’s Motion for Rule \n11 Sanctions also contained a material misstatement of the law in an entirely inapposite case, which he claims stood for the proposition that a “[f]ine of complete attorneys [sic] \nfees is a grossly improper amount.” (Pl.’s Mem. in Opp. 19, Dkt. No. 103.) Mr. Hechter’s Memorandum in Opposition to Allina’s Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions (Dkt. No. 103) cites “In Re The estate of Prince Rogers Nelson, Court File No. 10 PR 16 -46.” (Pl.’s Mem. in \nOpp. 19, Dkt. No. 103.) The Court read that case, a civil probate matter in state court, and was unpleasantly surprised to find it does not even mention Rule 11 or sanctions.  \n  \n \n4 During the hearing on Allina’s Motion for Sanctions and Mr. Hechter’s Motion to \nWithdraw, the Court held separate, in camera  discussion with both Mr. Hechter and Ms. \nPettit regarding privileged conversations between the two of them. Deciding Allina’s \nMotion requires the Court to address some of those conversations. Where necessary, the \nCourt does so in general terms to protect the rights that accompany the attorney-client \nprivilege that Ms. Pettit continues to hold in her conversations with Mr. Hechter, despite the fact that the Court granted Mr. Hechter’s Motion to Withdraw from representing Ms. \nPettit in this matter.  CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 13 of 2614 \n B. Legal Standard \nRule 11(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: \nBy presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper — \nwhether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it — an attorney \nor unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person’s knowledge, \ninformation, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the \ncircumstances: . . . \n \n(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing \nlaw or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing \nexisting law or for establishing new law; \n (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so \nidentified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity \nfor further investigation or discovery. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 11(b). The notes to Rule 11 make clear that “a litigant’s obligations with \nrespect to the contents of these papers are not measured solely as of the time they are filed \nwith or submitted to the court but include reaffirming to the court and advocating positions \ncontained in those pleadings and motions after learning that they cease to have any merit.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, 1993 amendment notes. \nRule 11 allows a district court to impose an “appropriate sanction” when a party \nfiles a complaint without making a reasonable inquiry that the claims are warranted by \nexisting law and that the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support. \nChandler v. Norwest Bank Minn., N.A. , 137 F.3d 1053, 1057 (8th Cir. 1998). A sanction \nimposed under Rule 11 “must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct \nor comparable conduct by others similarly situated.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(4). The sanction \nmay include “nonmonetary directives” and “payment to the movant of part or all of the \nreasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses directly resulting from the violation.” Id. “ In CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 14 of 2615 \n deciding whether an attorney is liable for sanctions for violating Rule 11, the standard is \nwhether the attorney’s conduct, viewed objectively, manifests either intentional or reckless \ndisregard of the attorney’s duties to the court.” Midwest Disability Initiative v. JANS \nEnterprises, Inc., No. 17-CV-4401 (JNE/FLN), 2017 WL 6389685, at *5 (D. Minn. Dec. \n13, 2017), aff'd, 929 F.3d 603 (8th Cir. 2019) (cleaned up) (citing Adams v. USAA Cas. Ins. \nCo., 863 F.3d 1069, 1077 (8th Cir. 2017)). \nAlso relevant here are the Minnesota Rules of Professional Conduct (“MRPC”), \nparticularly Rule 3.\n3: Candor Toward the Tribunal. Rule 3.3(a) states that a lawyer may \nnot knowingly: \n(1) make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal, or fail to correct a \nfalse statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the \nlawyer;  \n(2) fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling \njurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel; or  \n(3) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If a lawyer, the \nlawyer’s client, or a witness called by the lawyer has offered material \nevidence and the lawyer comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take \nreasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal. A lawyer may refuse to offer evidence, other than the testimony of \na defendant in a criminal matter, that the lawyer reasonably believes is false. \n \nMinn. R. of Pro. Cond. 3.3. Further, Comment 4 to that rule states that “[l]egal argument \nbased on a knowingly false representation of law constitutes dishonesty toward the tribunal.” Id. at cmt. 4. Pursuant to Local Rule 83.6(a), the Minnesota Rules for \nProfessional Conduct (“MRPC”) govern practice in this district. Schrader v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co. , No. 22-CV-241 (NEB/DJF), 2022 WL 19479776, at *1 (D. Minn. \nDec. 16, 2022) (citing D. Minn. LR 83.6(a) (“An attorney who is admitted to the court’s CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 15 of 2616 \n bar or who otherwise practices before the court must comply with the Minnesota Rules of \nProfessional Conduct, which are adopted as the rules of this court.”)). \nC. Discussion Mr. Hechter’s behavior in this case, in many ways, mirrors a 2011 case in this \nDistrict, Brown v. Ameriprise Fin. Servs., Inc. , 276 F.R.D. 599, 604 (D. Minn. 2011). In \nBrown, also a race-based employment discrimination case, the plaintiff’s complaint “parroted that in another case, in another Court, brought by different plaintiffs against a different company more than a decade earlier.” Brown, 276 F.R.D. 602 (D. Minn. 2011). As in Brown, “the Complaint here does not simply track the legal theories or claims advanced in [the previous case],  but rather copies large portions thereof \nverbatim, including those regarding specific employment policies and practices” and \n“merely changing the names of the parties.” Id. (emphasis in original) In fact, the copied \nparagraphs of Ms. Pettit’s complaint were more serious than those in Brown because they \nwere so charged, explicitly racist, and named specific supervisors who, Ms. Pettit \nacknowledged at her deposition, had never supervised her and who she had never heard \nuse the language alleged in the complaint. Further, the Court is persuaded that Allina is correct when it argues that had those false allegations not been included in the complaint, this case might well not have survived Allina’s original Motion to Dismiss.  \ni. Violations of Rule  11\n  \nHere, as in Brown, there is no question that Mr. Hechter has violated Rule 11. Both \ncomplaints Mr. Hechter filed, the original and the amended, included factual allegations copied straight from the Fielding Complaint, and Ms. Pettit testified under oath at her CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 16 of 2617 \n deposition that those factual allegations do not reflect her experiences. Mr. Hechter signed \nMs. Pettit’s amended complaint, knowing that it contained facts that he had copied from the Fielding Complaint, but despite that knowledge, he did not investigate the veracity of \nthose claims as to Ms. Pettit and, instead, he lied to the Court by claiming Mr. Fielding’s \nclaimed experiences were those of Ms. Pettit.  \na. Unsupported Factual Contentions \nRule 11 commands that all legal contentions must be warranted by existing law and \nall factual contentions in signed filings have evidentiary support or else the lawyer expects those contentions to have evidentiary support after discovery. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2),(3). Mr. Hechter violated Rule 11(b)(3) when he filed each complaint with the copied allegations from the Fielding Complaint. These violations were compounded each time \nMr. Hechter filed a signed document with the court without correcting those false allegations. The allegations in the Fielding Complaint are not true as applied to Ms. Pettit ,\n5 \nas Ms. Pettit confirmed in her deposition testimony. The following colloquies between Allina’s counsel and Ms. Pettit in her deposition, in which Allina’s counsel asked if Ms. Pettit had experienced the discriminatory acts described in her complaint, are illustrative: \nQ. So sitting here today, you have no evidence to support the allegation in \nyour complaint that states, \"Plaintiff would hear phrases like 'you people' \nreferring to blacks\"? You have no evidence to support that allegation, correct? \nA. That's correct. \nQ. Why is it in your complaint? \nA. I'm not sure. \n \n5 Nothing the Court says here should be construed as a finding as to the veracity of the \nallegations in the Fielding Complaint as they apply to Mr. Fielding’s case.   CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 17 of 2622 \n To be clear, though, even if microaggressions were actionable, dismissal would still \nbe warranted as a sanction for the factual misrepresentations in the complaint alone. Rule \n11 imposes on attorneys a duty to be truthful in their filings with the court. Their duty of \ntruthfulness includes not only a responsibility to refrain from submitting to the Court \nsomething the attorney knows not to be true, but the equally important responsibility to \nreasonably inquire into the truth of a factual allegation before claiming it as true in a submission. Mr. Hechter’s act of copying the allegations in the Fielding Complaint clearly \ndid not fulfill either responsibility. The copying was obviously done without much care or thought, as shown by the copying without amendment of allegations against specific, named individuals who supervised Mr. Fielding, but that Ms. Pettit testified at her deposition did not supervise her (and never had). (See Amended Compl. ¶20, Dkt. No. 25 \n(“Plaintiff has experienced harassment from her nurse manager Ms. Deb Scott”); Dep. of Pl. 71:5–72:6 (“Q: She was never one of your managers? Is that a fair statement? A: That’s \ncorrect. … Q: Ms. Scott never discriminated against you, correct? A: No, that’s correct. … she never did discriminate against me. Q: Ms. Scott is completely unrelated to your lawsuit, correct? A: That’s correct.”)). The Court can only speculate as to what lies behind such \nbehavior; Mr. Hechter might have thought nobody would read these complaints carefully, he might have been on a deadline he did not think he could meet, or any other reason. But \nthe Court does not need to speculate to note that Mr. Hechter accused individuals, by name \nand in a public document, of racism, and then he did it again in the amended complaint after Ms. Pettit had told him the allegations in the complaint were not true as to her. ( See \nDep. of Pl. 167:6–13 (“Q: Ms. Pettit … you seem a little surprised by what is in some of CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 22 of 2623 \n these allegations. … A: I didn’t say this, that’s why. And I pushed, I believe, for many of \nthese things to be amended.”).7  \nSecond, as noted above, Rule 11 not only sets it as desirable that a sanction for a \nviolation should be calibrated to deter similar misbehavior in the future, it states that courts \n“must” use that metric in determining the amount of an appropriate sanction. This amount \nis less than the amount Allina spent defending this lawsuit. After careful consideration, the \nCourt finds that Mr. Hechter and his firm, MLG, are jointly and severally liable  for payment \nto Allina of $10,000. The Court finds this amount sufficient, but not greater than, the amount needed to deter future behavior of this sort. To this, the Court adds $9,752.50, the amount ordered as a Rule 37 sanction related to Allina’s motion  to compel. The total \namount of sanctions imposed in this case is therefore $19,752.50.    \nThe Eighth Circuit recently held that it was in the discretion of the District Court to \naward the reasonable expenses incurred by a city in defending against duplicative litigation as monetary sanctions. Kezhaya v. City of Belle Plaine, Minnesota, 78 F.4th 1045, 1049 (8th Cir. 2023). For the purposes of sanctions, the Court sees no relevant difference between an attorney causing an opponent to incur legal fees as the result of a second, duplicative lawsuit (as in Kezhaya) and a litigant filing a complaint with allegations it knows to be false, which results in the otherwise unjust continuation of a single lawsuit. In \nKezhaya, the Eighth Circuit affirmed a District Court who awarded a defendant’s \nreasonably-incurred legal fees in their entirety against a single attorney for violations of \n \n7 Information provided by Ms. Pettit in camera, including email communication between \nMs. Pettit and Mr. Hechter corroborates this testimony.   CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 23 of 2624 \n Rule 11. Here, the Court recommends that Mr. Hechter, jointly and severally with his firm, \nbe ordered to pay Allina a sum that is considerably less than the amount Allina spent defending itself against a case that should not have been brought.   \nMr. Hechter has told the Court that he is “a working-class lawyer” on a small income \nand with modest savings, who cannot afford substantial sanctions. Mr. Hechter’s argument, if made a general rule of sanctions law, would allow lawyers who are not financially well off to commit sanctionable behavior without consequence. In addition, these sanctions are joint and several with a law firm. Finally, the Court has been given good reason not to believe Mr. Hechter unless what he says is corroborated  \nThe Court does not know and cannot speculate as to Mr. Hechter’s intent when he \nfiled a complaint with false statements and a brief with clearly misstated legal assertions, \nbut each of the offending documents was filed with the knowledge that they contained false \nstatements and without Mr. Hechter having exhibited the diligent review required of any \nlawyer filing papers with the Court under Rule 11. The sanctions here are sufficient, but not greater than, the amount needed to ameliorate the harm caused by Mr. Hechter’s actions and to prevent similar misstatements in the future. \nCONCLUSION \n As officers of the Court, attorneys are expected to act with professionalism and \ncandor to the Court and to their fellow litigants. Mr. Hechter failed to meet that expectation when he filed two different pleadings with the Court that made false statements about his \nclient’s experiences that accused certain individuals of using racial slurs. These filings were made even after his client told him that they were not ready to be filed. Further, in CASE 0:23-cv-02789-JWB-JFD     Doc. 114     Filed 01/30/25     Page 24 of 2625 \n defending against Allina’s motion for sanctions, he misrepresented the legal conclusions \nof a state court case which was entirely irrelevant to the issue he argued. These actions constitute violations of Rule 11 and the Minnesota Rules of Professional Conduct. As sanctions for his violations of Rule 11, the Court recommends that Mr. Hechter and his \nfirm be ordered to pay $10,000 towards Allina’s reasonably incurred fees and costs and  \nthat this case be dismissed with prejudice.  \nRECOMMENDATION \nBased upon the foregoing and all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS \nHEREBY RECOMMENDED that Defendant’s Motion for Rule 11 Sanctions (Dkt. No. \n91) be GRANTED in part and DENIED in part as follows: \n1. To the extent Allina seeks dismissal of Ms. Pettit’s claims, the motion should be GRANTED in full.  \n2. To the extent Allina seeks attorneys’ fees, the motion should be GRANTED in \npart. Mr. Hechter and Morris Law Group should be ordered to pay Allina $10,000 \ntowards Allina’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs associated with litigating this \nmatter. To the extent Allina seeks attorneys’ fees from Ms. Pettit herself as a \nsanction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, the motion should be DENIED. \nNOTICE \nFiling Objections: This Report and Recommendation is not an order or judgment of the \nDistrict Court and is therefore not appealable directly to the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. Under LR 72.2(b)(1), “a party may file and serve specific written objections to a \nmagistrate judge’s proposed finding and recommendations within 14 days after being \nserved a copy” of the Report and Recommendation. A party may respond to those objections within 14 days after being served a copy of the objections. D. Minn. LR \n72.2(b)(2).

    "summary": "### 1. Summary\n\nPlaintiffs Adam and Regan Moomaw filed a class-action lawsuit against GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd and GeoSnapShot, Inc., alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to the collection of facial biometrics via GeoSnapShot's platform during a Tough Mudder event in Illinois. GeoSnapShot's platform used AI to allow users to search for photographs taken at events by uploading a \"selfie,\" thereby extracting and comparing facial geometry data from the images. In ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the court denied GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd's motion and allowed limited jurisdictional discovery regarding GeoSnapShot, Inc.\n\n### 2. Key Legal Issue\n\nWhether the court has personal jurisdiction over GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd and its subsidiary GeoSnapShot, Inc., given their activities related to collecting biometric data from Illinois residents via an online platform.\n\n### 3. Court's Holding\n\nThe court denied GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, finding sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois due to their involvement with an online platform facilitating photography services at events, including Illinois locations. For GeoSnapShot, Inc., the court ordered limited jurisdictional discovery to further assess its connections to Illinois before a final ruling on jurisdiction could be made.\n\n### 4. ELI5 Explanation\n\nThe court case is about whether two companies, GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd (from Australia) and its U.S. arm, GeoSnapShot, Inc., can be sued in Illinois. They run an online photo service using AI technology tied to events like Tough Mudder. When users upload their selfies, AI matches them with photos taken at these events. The court decided that the Australian company could be sued in Illinois because they knew their technology was being used to serve Illinois residents. However, the court wants more information before deciding if the U.S. company can be tied to Illinois in the same way.",

BACKGROUND \nA. Overview \nGeoSnapShot created and owns and ope rates an online photo platform on a \nglobally accessible website: www.geosnapshot.com  (“Website”). (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). \nPhotographers who register with GeoSnapSho t (“Photographers”), thereby agreeing to \nits Terms of Service, can use the Website to upload (and in some instances, license to \nWebsite users) photos they take at events , and Website users can use the Website to \nsearch for, view, download (and in some case s, purchase licenses to) the photos. (Doc. 26-\n1 ¶ 5). For Photographers to be able to upload  photos, an “event organizer” (who is not a \nGeoSnapShot employee) first must create an  event on the Website. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 7).  \nGeoSnapShot’s business model is depend ent on its collection and use of the \nbiometrics of the people depicted in it s online photo platform. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 5). \nGeoSnapShot encourages event participants to find photos of themselves by uploading a \n“selfie” and allowing its artificial intelligence to compare that photo wi th the others in its \ndatabase. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 5). This can only be done by extracting from each photo data \nrepresenting the unique geometry of each fa cial image so that comparisons can be made. \n(Doc. 1-2 ¶ 5). Under BIPA, “scan[s] of  . . . face geometry” are biometrics, 740 ILCS 14/10 . \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs argue, GeoSnapShot ca nnot collect or use such scans unless it \ncomplies with BIPA.  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 2 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>3 \n In April 2019, GeoSnapShot contracted wi th Tough Mudder, an endurance event \ncompany, to allow Photographers to attend and take photographs of participants in \nTough Mudder events. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 33). On August 24, 2019, Plai ntiffs attended the “Tough \nMudder Chicago Saturday” event held in Rockford, Illinois. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 39). Thereafter, Plaintiffs used GeoSnapShot’s Website to loca te pictures of themselves participating in \nthe event. Plaintiffs “purchased” complim entary licenses to those photographs and \ndownloaded the same, receiving a receipt from GeoSnapShot.   \nB. GeoSnapShot \nGeoSnapShot is a proprietary limited comp any under the laws of Australia and is \nbased in Sydney, Australia. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 10;  Doc. 26-1 ¶¶ 2-3). Ge oSnapShot does not \nmaintain a place of business in Illinois. (D oc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnapShot does not employ \nanyone in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnapS hot does not own, lease, or occupy any \nproperty in Illinois, and it does not own an y investments in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). \nGeoSnapShot employs seven full-time employees , and none of those employees are based \nin Illinois. GeoSnapShot’s Website is not ho sted in Illinois and GeoSnapShot does not \nprocess photographs in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3; Doc. 27 p. 3).  \nC. GeoSnapShot Delaware \n GeoSnapShot Delaware is wholly owned by GeoSnapShot and is a conduit \nthrough which GeoSnapShot conducts business in the United States. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 12). \nGeoSnapShot Delaware was incorporated in  Delaware on or about January 13, 2023, and Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 3 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>4 \n has its principal place of business in Denv er, Colorado. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 14). GeoSnapShot \nDelaware does not maintain a place of busine ss in Illinois; does no t employ anyone in \nIllinois; and does not own or lease any property in Illinois.  (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 15). GeoSnapShot \nDelaware has three employees, and those em ployees are based in Denver, Colorado. \n(Doc. 26-1 ¶ 15).  \nD. GeoSnapShot Website  \nGeosnapshot.com is a globally accessible website created and owned and operated \nby GeoSnapShot. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 4; Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). The Website includ es an online photo \nplatform that is operated by GeoSnapShot.  (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 4; Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). GeoSnapShot \nmarkets its platform to both event organi zers and photographers. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 21).  \nFor Photographers to be able to upload ph otos to the Website, an event organizer, \nsuch as Tough Mudder, must first create an event on the GeoSnapShot website. (Doc. 26-\n1 ¶¶ 5, 7; Doc. 1-2 ¶ 22). Photographers who a ttend the event can then upload photos \nthey take at the event to the Website. (Doc . 1-2 ¶¶ 23-25; Doc. 26-1 ¶¶ 5, 7; Doc. 27-1).  \nE. GeoSnapShot Terms and Conditions \nAs a condition to using the Website, Photographers must register with the \nWebsite. (Doc. 27-1 pp. 2-4).

GeoSnapShot and Tough Mudder  \nIn 2019, GeoSnapShot contracted with Toug h Mudder for Photographers to attend \nand take photographs of participants in Tough Mudder events. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 33). Tough \nMudder promotes endurance events where participants attempt 10-to-12-mile-long \nobstacle courses that feature hazards such as fields of mud and tanks of cold water. (Doc. \n1-2 ¶ 34). In an article promoting the p artnership between GeoSnapShot and Tough \nMudder, GeoSnapShot founder and chief executive Andy Edwards (“Edwards”) emphasized that GeoSnapShot’s biometric-base d Selfie Search feature was central to the Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 8 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>9 \n agreement. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 36). As Edwards stat ed in the article, because Tough Mudder \nparticipants “come out from the muddy depths , face recognition is the only thing that \nwill find photos of them.” (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 36). In the same article, Edwards touted that the \nTough Mudder partnership would help GeoS napShot realize “500% growth” in 2019. \n(Doc. 1-2 ¶ 37). Between August 2019 and December 2022, GeoSnapShot’s Website has hosted thousands of photographs from at least ten Tough Mudder events located in \nIllinois. (Doc. 1-2 ¶¶ 45, 46).  \nG. Plaintiffs  \n On August 24, 2019, Plaintiff’s attended the “Tough Mudder Chicago Saturday” \nevent in Rockford, Illinois. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 39). At  the event, photographers took photographs \nof Plaintiffs and uploaded them to GeoSnapS hot. (Doc. 1-2 ¶¶ 41-42). During the upload \nprocess, GeoSnapShot extracted facial bi ometrics from the photographs without the \nPlaintiff’s consent. (Doc. 1-2 ¶¶ 41-42). Re gan Moomaw later used the GeoSnapShot \nwebsite to “purchase” and download complim entary licenses to the photographs and \nwas issued a receipt from GeoSnapShot (D oc. 26-1 ¶ 13, Doc. 27 p. 2). The receipt \nconfirmed that each photograph was from th e “Tough Mudder Chicago Saturday” event. \n(Doc. 27-2).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nUnder Rule 12(b)(2), a court may dismiss a claim for lack \nof personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) . A plaintiff need not \nallege facts about personal jurisdiction in his or her complaint, but in the face of a Rule Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 9 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>10 \n 12(b)(2)  motion, “the plaintiff bears the burd en of demonstrating the existence of \njurisdiction.” Curry v. Revolution Labs., LLC , 949 F.3d 385, 392 (7th Cir. \n2020)  (quoting Purdue Research Found. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. \n2003) ). When a court rules on a Rule 12(b)(2)  motion based only on written submissions, \na plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction. GCIU-Employer \nRet. Fund v. Goldfarb Corp. , 565 F.3d 1018, 1023 (7th Cir. 2009) . Where, as here, a defendant \nsubmits an affidavit regarding personal jurisd iction, this Court accepts as true any facts \nin the affidavit that do not conflict with the complaint or the plaintiff's \nsubmissions. Curry , 949 F.3d at 393 . Further, where a defendant challenges \nby declaration a fact alleged in the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff must go beyond the \npleadings and submit affirmative evidence supporting the exercise of jurisdiction. Purdue \nResearch Foundation , 338 F.3d at 783 . If the plaintiff “fails to refute a fact contained in the \ndefendant's affidavit, that fact is accepted as true.” Mold-A-Rama Inc. v. Collector-\nConcierge-Int'l , 451 F.Supp.3d 881, 884 (N.D. Ill. 2020) .  \nIII.   DISCUSSION \nA. Applicable Law \nWhen a federal court sits in diversity,4 the court exercises personal jurisdiction to \nthe same extent as a state court. Philos Techs., Inc. v. Philos & D, Inc ., 645 F.3d 851, 855 n.2 \n(7th Cir. 2011) . The Illinois long-arm statute permits jurisdiction to the same limits as the \n \n4 Defendants have shown that diversity jurisdiction exists under the Class Action Fairness Act because \nPlaintiffs are citizens of Illinois, GeoSnapShot Delaware is a citizen of Delaware and Colorado, GeoSnapShot is a citizen of Australia, the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million, and plaintiff seeks to \nrepresent a class in excess of 100 members.

Revolution Lab'ys, LLC , 949 F.3d 385, 393 (7th Cir. \n2020) ;  735 ILCS 5/2-209(c) . The Due Process Clause  allows personal jurisdiction over an \nout-of-state defendant if the defendant has “c ertain minimum contacts with [the state] \nsuch that the maintenance of the suit does no t offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and \nsubstantial justice.’ ” Kipp v. Ski Enter. Corp. of Wisconsin , 783 F.3d 695, 697 (7th Cir. \n2015)  (quoting Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) ). Jurisdiction may be \ngeneral or specific, J.S.T. Corp. v. Foxconn Interconnect Tech. Ltd. , 965 F.3d 571, 575 (7th Cir. \n2020) , but only specific jurisdiction is in issue here.5 \nSpecific jurisdiction is about “the rela tionship among the defendant, the forum, \nand the litigation.” Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 284 (2014)  (quoting Keeton v. Hustler \nMag., Inc. , 465 U.S. 770, 775 (1984) ). Specific jurisdiction  arises when there is:  \n(1) purposeful availment – the defendant must have purposefully directed \nhis activities at the forum state or purposefully availed himself of the \nprivilege of conducting business in the forum;  \n(2) relatedness – the alleged injury mu st arise out of or relate to the \ndefendant’s forum-related activities; and  \n(3) fairness – the exercise of person al jurisdiction must comport with \ntraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. \n \nB.D. by & through Myer v. Samsung SDI Co.,  91 F.4th 856, 861 (7th Cir. 2024)   \n“For purposeful availment, a defendant must have ‘certain minimum contacts’ \nwith the forum state.” Id. (quoting Int’l Shoe Co. v. Wash Off. Of Unemployment Comp.  \nPlacement, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) ). “Requiring minimum contac ts protects the defendant \n \n5 Plaintiffs only raise arguments as to the presence  of specific personal jurisdiction.

HANWJH, 46 F.4th 614, 619 (7th Cir. 2022) . The contacts must create a \n“substantial connection” with the state and no t be the result of “random,” “fortuitous” \nor “attenuated” contacts. Burger King Co. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 475 (1985) .  Rather, \n“the ‘defendant’s conduct and connection with  the forum State’ must be such that it \nshould ‘reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.’” Citadel Grp. V. Washington \nRegional Medical Center, 536 F.3d 757, 761 (7th Cir. 2008)  (quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at \n474). Nonetheless, physical presence in the foru m state is not required for the defendant \nto have sufficient minimum co ntacts with the forum state.  NBA Properties, Inc. v. \nHANWJH , 46 F.4th 614, 624 (7th Cir. 2022) .  \nThe contacts must come from the activity of  the defendant, not from the activity of \nthe plaintiff or a third party.

HANWJH , 46 F.4th 614, 621 (7th \nCir. 2022) .  \nThe Seventh Circuit has refused “to fash ion a special jurisdictional test for \nInternet-based cases.”  Curry v. Revolution Lab'ys, LLC, 949 F.3d 385, 398 (7th Cir. 2020)  \n(citation omitted). Specific personal jurisd iction, however, is not established merely \nbecause a website is available in the forum. NBA Properties, Inc. v. HANWJH , 46 F.4th 614, \n619 (7th Cir. 2022) . Rather, the website operator must  stand ready and willing to do \nbusiness with residents of the forum and then knowingly do business with those \nresidents.” Id. (internal citations and quotations removed).  \nB. GeoSnapShot6  \n1. Purposeful Direction or Purposeful Availment  \n GeoSnapShot contends the Court cannot asse rt jurisdiction over it because it has \nno physical presence in the state and because its Website’s transactions are not stored or \nprocessed in Illinois. But “physical presence  is not necessary for a defendant to have \nsufficient minimum contacts  with a forum state,” Curry, 949 F.3d at 398 . Rather, \nestablishing minimum contacts s ufficient for the exercise of sp ecific personal jurisdiction \ndepends on whether the defe ndant has “purposefully dire cted [its] activities” or \n \n6 In evaluating personal jurisdiction, the Court addresses each Defendant separately. See Purdue Rsch. \nFound. v. Sanofi-Sunthelabo, S.A., 338 F.3d 773, 784 (7th Cir. 2003)  (“[E]ach defendant's contacts with the \nforum State must be assessed individually.”).

In other \nwords, the “inquiry boils down to this: has [GeoSnapShot] purposely exploited the \nIllinois market?”  be2 LLC v. Ivanov,  642 F.3d 555, 558 (7th Cir. 2011) .  \n GeoSnapShot contends that it has not purposely exploited the Illinois market \nbecause, among other things, it is merely a technology vendor, and any contacts it has \nwith Illinois are random, fortuitous, or atte nuated: the result of a third party’s conduct \nand/or a Website user’s unilateral conduct. It’s  true, for specific personal jurisdiction to \nexist, the contacts must come from the activity of GeoSnapShot, and not from the activity \nof a plaintiff or third party. Purdue Research Found. V. Sanofi-Synthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, \n780 (7th Cir. 2003) . See also Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 285 (2014) ; Curry , 949 F.3d at 396 . \nBut this case is distinguishable from other cases involving technology vendors where courts have found specific personal jurisdiction lacking. \nFor example, GeoSnapShot cites to Redd v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc ., 2023 WL \n3505264 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2023)  for the proposition that GeoSnapShot, an out-of-state \ntechnology vendor, is not subject to pe rsonal jurisdiction in Illinois. In Redd , the plaintiff \nfiled a putative class action  against Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“AWS”), alleging \nviolations of BIPA. AWS provided cloud comp uting services and was registered to do \nbusiness in Illinois. AWS marketed and sold  a program called “Rekognition” (an image-\nrecognition technology) to businesses and ot her entities. A third party, Wonolo, Inc. \n(“Wonolo”) ran a mobile application that a llowed users to apply for jobs in various \nindustries. Wonolo contracted with AWS to  utilize its Rekognition technology on its \nmobile application. The plaintiff downloaded Wonolo’s application to apply for jobs at Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 14 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>15 \n several locations in Illinois. Each time sh e accepted a job through Wonolo, she scanned \nher image, thereby utilizing the Rekognition te chnology. The district court dismissed the \nplaintiff’s BIPA claims for lack of personal ju risdiction because, other than registering to \ndo business in Illinois, AWS’s only contac t with Illinois was providing its facial \nrecognition technology to Wonolo who used it in Illinois.  \nGeoSnapShot urgers this Court to find  that, like AWS, a third-party stands \nbetween GeoSnapShot and its contacts with Illinois. But unlike AWS, GeoSnapShot was \nnot merely involved in a one-off transaction with a third party who, without \nGeoSnapShot’s knowledge, utilized GeoSnapShot’s technology in Illinois for its own \npurposes. On the contrary, GeoSnapShot create d and operated a self-hosted interactive \nwebsite and allowed users, including Illinoi s users, to engage in commerce on that \nwebsite.7  \nFurther, the record reflects that, as th e owner and operator of the Website, \nGeoSnapShot stood “ready and willing” to do business with Illinois residents and then \nknowingly did business with Illinois residents. NBA Properties, Inc. v. HANWJH, 46 \nF.4th 614, 619-22 (7th Cir. 2022) . See also Illinois v. Hemi Grp. LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 758 (7th \nCir. 2010) . GeoSnapShot contends that there is no basis for concluding that it was “ready \nand willing” to do business with Illinois re sidents because (1) Tough Mudder events are \nheld throughout the United Stat es and the United Kingdom; (2 ) no advertising is directed \nat Illinois; and (3) GeoSnapShot is not involv ed in selecting the location of Tough Mudder \n \n7 The fact that GeoSnapShot’s website was available in Illinois, standing alone, does not establish specific \npersonal jurisdiction over GeoSnapShot. NBA Properties, Inc. v. HANWJH, 46  F.4th 614, 619 (7th Cir. 2022) .  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 15 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>16 \n events.8 GeoSnapShot further contends there is no basis for concluding that GeoSnapShot \nknowingly did business with Illinois resi dents because it does not know where \nphotographed individuals reside (Photographe rs do not provide residential information \nfor individuals pictured in ph otographs and event participants  do not provide residential \ninformation when they purchase and/or license photographs from the Website).  \nBut “[t]here is no per se requirement that  the defendant especia lly target the forum \nin its business activity; it is sufficient that the de fendant reasonably co uld foresee that its \nproduct would be sold in the forum. Curry v. Revolution Lab'ys, LLC , 949 F.3d 385, 399 (7th \nCir. 2020) . See also  Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781 (1984)  (with a \nnationwide market, the publisher reasonably should have anticipated that it could be \nheld accountable in the forum state for activi ties arising from the “substantial number” \nof sales in the forum state). Here, there is  ample evidence supporting a finding that \nGeoSnapShot reasonably should have foreseen that it would be licen sing (and in some \ncases selling) photographs from its online photo platform to Illinois residents.  \nFirst, GeoSnapShot entered into a co ntract with Tough Mudder to store \nphotographs taken at Tough Mudder events an d to make those photographs available to \nevent participants. The location of the even ts GeoSnapShot hosted on its Website was \nknown to GeoSnapShot. For example, GeoSnapShot’s Website hosts over 22,000 photographs from an event identified on the Website as “Tough  Mudder Chicago 2022 \nSaturday.” The address for that page is https://geosnapshot.com/e/tough-mudder-\n \n8 GeoSnapShot also contends it had no control ov er the Photographers attending Tough Mudder events. \nThe Court addresses this contention below.  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 16 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>17 \n chicago-2022-saturday/16028.  (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 46 & n.8). Second, GeoSnapShot admits that it \n“operates” an “online photo platform” (Doc. 26-1), and that Website users can license \nphotographs from that platform. This includes  thousands of photographs taken at Illinois \nevents. In the instant case, GeoSnapShot provided Plaintiffs with a license for \nphotographs taken at an Illinois event, an d after Plaintiffs licensed the photographs, \nGeoSnapShot issued a receipt identifying ea ch photograph as “Tough Mudder Chicago \nSaturday.” (Doc. 27-2).  \nThese contacts are not “random,” “fortuitou s,” or “attenuated.” They are the result \nof decisions made by GeoSnapShot, including:  the decision to enter into a contract with \nTough Mudder, an entity that GeoSnapShot kn ew held events nationally, including in \nIllinois; the decision to operate a website that hosts thousands of photographs from \nIllinois events; and the decision to license and/ or sell photographs take n at Illinois events \nto Website users. As such, even assuming  GeoSnapShot did not specifically direct \nadvertising at Illinois and did not know ea ch Website user’s address, GeoSnapShot \n“reasonably could foresee” that it would be t ransacting business with Illinois residents. \nCurry , 949 F.3d at 399–400 . See also NBA Properties, Inc. v. HANWJH, 46 F.4th 614, 625 \n(7th Cir. 2022)  (specific personal jurisdiction pres ent where website operator “structured \nits sales activity in such a manner as to in vite orders from Illinois and developed the \ncapacity to fill them.). In other words, Ge oSnapShot purposely exploited the Illinois \nmarket in a way that it should have reason ably foreseen its technology being used by, Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 17 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>20 \n being representatives of GeoSnapShot.13 Thus, GeoSnapShot’s Terms of Service support \na finding that the Photographers are acting as GeoSnapShot’s agents when they photograph events in Illinois.\n 14 See e.g., Blockmon v. McClellan , 143 N.E.3d 279, 289–92 (Ill. \nApp. Ct. 2019) (evidence showing that princi pal “had the right to control whether sales \nrepresentatives could make sales over the in ternet” and “had control over whether . . . \nsales representatives could use business card s with [the alleged principal’s] names” \nsupported finding of agency relationship); Grillo v. Yeager Constr ., 900 N.E.2d 1249, 1264 \n(Ill. App. Ct. 2008)  (An alleged principal’s identification  of a person as its “representative” \nsupports a finding that person was its agent) . Thus, the Photographers’ physical presence \nin Illinois can be attributed to GeoSnapShot, establishing purposeful availment. Walden \nv. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 285 (2014)  (“[P]hysical entry into the State—either by the defendant \nin person or through an agent, goods, mail, or some other means—is certainly a relevant \ncontact.”). \n \n \n \npublicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate,  excerpt . . . and distribute copies of your Media \nMaterial.” (Doc. 27-1 § 4.3.2).  \n \n13 The Terms of Service state that photographers who “book onto a GeoSnapShot event . . . are deemed to \nbe representing GeoSnapShot at that event.”  \n14 GeoSnapShot’s Terms of Service state that Sellers “are not considered or  classified as employees, agents, \nrepresentatives, independent contractors, dependent co ntractors, sub-contractors, licensees, franchises or \nany other form of employee of the Site or the Compan y.” (Doc. 27-1 § 10). But, when determining whether \nan agency relationship exists, “the declaration of th e parties is not controlling where the conduct of the \nparties demonstrates the existenc e of an agency relationship.” McNerney v. Allamuradov , 84 N.E.3d 437, 454  \n(Ill. App. Ct. 2017). Additionally, as argued by Plaintiffs, GeoSnapShot’s disclaimer of any legal relationship \nwith Photographers is particularly questionable given that Photographers agree that they are “representing \nGeoSnapShot” at any event they “book onto.” (Doc. 27-1 § 8.2).  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 20 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>21 \n 2. Arise Out of or Relate to the Forum Contacts \nThe Court next addresses whether Plaintiffs’ BIPA claims arise out of or relate to \nGeoSnapShot’s forum-related activities. A “defendant’s minimum contacts with the \nforum state [must] be suit-related.” Curry , 949 F.3d at 400  (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). But a strict causal connect ion between the defendant’s in-state activity \nand the plaintiff’s suit is not required. Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 141 S. \nCt. 1017, 1026 (2021) . In the instant case, GeoSnapShot’ s forum related contacts include \nexploiting the Illinois market by operating an online photo platform for Tough Mudder \nevents, including events located in Illinois ; licensing photograph s to individuals who \nparticipated in Tough Mudder events located in  Illinois; and physical presence at Illinois \nevents attributable to GeoSnapShot by virtue of its relationship with the Photographers who upload photographs to the Website. Plaintiffs’ lawsuit is about GeoSnapShot \nimproperly extracting their biometrics from  photographs that were uploaded to its \nWebsite. GeoSnapShot was only able to extract that data because of the contacts described \nabove. As such, there is a substantial conne ction between GeoSnapShot’s forum contacts \nand the Plaintiffs’ alleged injury. See e.g., Dzananovic v. Bumple, Inc., 2023 WL 4405833, at \n* 6 (N.D. Ill. July 7, 2023)  (BIPA suit alleging defendants used their facial recognition \ntechnology to collect plaintiff’s biometri c information while he used the photo \nverification feature on online dating application substantially connected to defendants’ marketing activity and exploita tion of Illinois market); Kukovec v. Estee Lauder Cos., Inc., \n2022 WL 16744196, at *1 (N .D. Ill. Nov. 7, 2022)  (BIPA suit – which alleged that the \ndefendant’s optional makeup try-on tool on  its website collected plaintiff’s facial-Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 21 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>22 \n geometry data – related to the defendant’s sale  of cosmetics in Illinois because the virtual \ntry-on tool was part of the defendant’s sales and marketing of its cosmetics).  \n3. Fair play and substantial justice \nThe exercise of specific jurisdiction shou ld not “offend the traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice”. Int’l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Off. Of Unemployment \nComp. & Placement , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) . If sufficient contacts to the forum state are \nshown, then the defendant must make a “com pelling” case that jurisdiction would be \nunfair. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 477 (1985) . GeoSnapShot has not \naddressed whether exercising specific jurisdic tion would be unfair, focusing instead on \nwhether minimum contacts exist, and the Co urt finds no factors that militate against \nexercising personal jurisdiction.  Indeed, where, as here, a defendant “structure[s] its [online \nconduct] so that it can easily serve [Illinoi s] consumers,” and “h[olds] itself [out] as \nconducting business nationwide,” there is no thing unduly burdensome about subjecting \nit to suit in Illinois. Curry , 949 F.3d at 402 . Further, Illinois has an interest in providing a \nforum for its residents, such as Plaintiffs an d other class members, to seek redress for the \ncollection of their biometric information in violation of BIPA, an Illinois statute.  \nC. GeoSnapShot Delaware \nDefendants contend that, because GeoSna pShot Delaware was not formed until \nJanuary 13, 2023, it did not have contact with I llinois during the period in question and \nmust therefore be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.15 Plaintiffs, however, allege \n \n15 The Tough Mudder event from which the claim arose occurred on August 24, 2019. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 39.). Plaintiffs \nallege that ten other Tough Mudder events occurred in  Illinois between August 24, 2019 and December 4, 2022. ( Id. \n¶ 45.). Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 22 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>23 \n that GeoSnapShot Delaware “is wholly owned,  directly or indirectly, by GeoSnapShot \nPty Ltd, and is a conduit through which GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd conducts business in the United States.” (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 12). Because Defendants do not refute GeoSnapShot Delaware’s alleged role in assisting GeoSnapShot in conducting business in the United States, Plaintiffs contend they are en titled to jurisdictional discovery.  \n District courts have discretion to author ize limited discovery into jurisdictional \nissues. See In re Sheehan , 48 F.4th 513, 526 (7th Cir. 2022). Howev er, “[a] plaintiff must be \nable to establish a colorable or prima faci e showing of personal jurisdiction before \ndiscovery should be permitted.” Id. Meeting this standard is  not particularly onerous; \ncourts typically allow jurisdictional discove ry if the plaintiff can show an ambiguity \nexists or that some jurisdictional facts are unclear. JT's Frames, Inc. v. Casares , 2018 WL \n835225, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 13, 2018) .  \nThe Court finds that the alleged corporat e relationship between the Defendants, \nwarrants further exploration. Without juri sdictional discovery, Plaintiffs cannot \nreasonably be expected to offer contrary evid ence of Defendants’ corporate structure or \noperations in the United States during the relevant time. Accordingly, the Motion to \nDismiss Defendant GeoSnapShot Delaware will be DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE \npending limited jurisdictional discovery, at  the conclusion of which, GeoSnapShot \nDelaware may re-file its motion.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, Defend ant GeoSnapShot PTY LTD’s Motion to \nDismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction (Doc. 26) is DENIED .

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nThe court case concerns Kenneth Lenk's lawsuit against Monolithic Power Systems, Inc., alleging discrimination and retaliation in employment. The court addresses multiple motions, including Monolithic's motion to dismiss Lenk's First Amended Complaint (FAC), which is partially granted, and Lenk's motion for default judgment and to amend the complaint, which are denied. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is referenced concerning Monolithic's use of AI in its hiring process, AI is not central to the court's decision.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe key legal issue is whether Lenk's FAC states plausible claims for discrimination and retaliation that are not barred by preclusion doctrines or other legal deficiencies such as failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court grants in part and denies in part Monolithic's motion to dismiss, allowing some of Lenk's claims to proceed while dismissing others. Lenk's motions for default judgment and to amend to add BlackRock as a defendant are denied.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation:\nKenny sued his old boss, saying they didn't hire him back because they didn't like him for reasons like his age and past lawsuits. The judge said he couldn't make the same arguments he lost before and told him to fix his legal paper. Kenny tried to add another company to blame, but the judge said no because his reasons didn’t make sense and he needed real facts, not guesses. Some parts of Kenny's case get to move ahead, but not all of them.",

No. CV-23-02083 -PHX -SHD  \n \nORDER  \n \n  \n Pending before the Court are (1) Defendant Monolithic Power Systems Inc.’s \n(“Monolithic”) motion to dismiss Plaintiff Kenneth Lenk’s First Amended Complaint \n(“FAC”), (Doc. 31), and related request for judicial notice, (Doc. 32); (2) Lenk’s motion \nfor defau lt against  Monolithic, (Doc. 42); and (3) Lenk’s motion for leave to amend the \nFAC, (Doc. 48).  For the reasons explained below, the Court grants in part and denies in \npart Monolithic’s motion to dismiss  and grants  its request for judicial notice, denies  \nLenk’s motion for default, and denies  Lenk’s motion for leave to amend the FAC  to add a \ndefendant .1 \nI. BACKGROUND  \nThe parties are familiar with the factual background of this case, ( see generally Doc. \n25 at 1–5), so it is unnecessary to recount it in detail .  In short, as recognized previously, \n“[t]his case is merely the latest entry in a long -running litigation saga that commenced in \n2015.”  ( Id. at 1.)  See Lenk v. Monolithic Power Sys. Inc. , No. 15 -cv-01148 -NC, 2015 WL \n \n1  The parties did not request oral argument, so the Court decides these motions \nwithout holding a hearing.  See LRCiv 7.2(f).  Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 1 of 36 \n- 2 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 6152475 (N.D. Cal. 2015), 2015 WL 7429498 (N.D. Cal. 2015), 2016 WL 1258862 (N.D. \nCal. 2016) (“ Lenk I ”); Lenk v. Monolithic Power Sys. Inc. , No. 16 -cv-02625 -BLF,  2017 \nWL 2491597 (N.D. Cal. 2017),  2017 WL 1832198 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (“ Lenk II ”); Lenk v. \nMonolithic Power Sys. Inc. , No. 19 -cv-03791 -BLF, 2020 WL 619846 (N.D. Cal. 2020) \n(“Lenk III ”); Lenk v. Monolithic Power Sys., Inc. , No. 20 -cv-08094 -BLF, 2021 WL \n5233078 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (“ Lenk IV ”).  In his previous  cases, Lenk generally alleged that \nMonolithic,  his former employer, discriminated against him, harassed him, subjected him \nto adverse employment actions, constructively discharged him , and prevent ed him from \nobtaining other employment .  (See Doc. 25 at 2.)  The courts in  Lenk II –IV ultimately \ndismissed those  suits largely  under the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion.  ( See id.  at \n2–5.) \nLenk filed the instant case (“ Lenk V ”) in October 2023.   (Doc. 1.)  His “90 -page \nComplaint recapitulate[d] all of the facts that he [had] already presented to the courts in \nLenk I –IV, focusing heavily on the constructive discharge, retaliation, harassment, and \nblacklisting that [Lenk] believes he has suffered and continues to suffer at the hands of \n[Monolithic].”  (Doc. 25 at 5.)   Monolithic’s motion to dismiss the Complaint  was granted \nbecause  Lenk was “collaterally estopped under the doctrine of issue pre clusion from \nreasserting the same facts that undergirded his unsuccessful lawsuits in Lenk IV .”  (Id. at \n9.)  Th is, “standing alone [,] merit[ed] dismissal ,” because Lenk’s “various claims [were] \nthoroughly entangled with the issues that [were]  subject to preclusion by virtue of Lenk \nIV,” such that “the precluded issues upon which [Lenk] relie[d] ” could not be disaggregated  \n“from those that might not be precluded.”  ( Id.) \nLenk , however,  had “allege[d] new facts that might provide sufficient independent \nsupport for his claims such that portions of the Complaint might withstand [Monolithic’s] \nMotion to Dismiss.”  ( Id. at 10.)  These allegations included that “Halo Semiconductor, \nSiTime, Infineon, Microchip, and Renesas ” did not hire him  “and that the interviewers at \neach of those companies pursued a line of questioning that indicated they had conferred \nwith [Monolithic] beforehand.”  ( Id.)  Lenk had not “adequately connect[ed]  the dots,” Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 2 of 36 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n though .”  (Id. at 10 –11.)  \nNevertheless, the Court “indulge [d] the assumption that [Lenk] failed to adequately \nallege his claims not because he [had] no claim to allege, but instead because he became \ncaught up in portraying the narrative as a continuing course of conduct going back to 2012.”  \n(Id. at 11.)  Thus, because a “few of [Lenk’s] claims might have merit, and in light of [his] \nstatus as a pro se litigant,” Lenk’s Complaint was dismissed with leave to amend .  (Id.)  \nBut because  Lenk was warned that “his amended complaint (1) must not allege any facts \nor claims predicated thereon already rejected in Lenk I –IV and (2) must comply with Rule \n8(a).”  ( Id. at 11 –12.)  Lenk was informed that any failure to comply with the Order would \n“result in dismissal of [Lenk’s] amended pleading and the possible imposition of sanctions, \nincluding but not limited to an order to pay attorney fees and a formal declaration that \n[Lenk] is a vexatious litigant.”  ( Id. at 12.)  \nOn October 3, 2024, Lenk filed the FAC.  (Doc. 26.)  The FAC asserted the same \nfifteen claims that were dismissed .  (Compare Doc. 25 at 5, with Doc. 26 at 13 –28.) \nOn October 24, 2024, Monolithic filed the instant motion to dismiss the FAC.  (Doc. \n31.)  In support, Monolithic filed a request for judicial notice .  (Doc. 32 .) \nOn November 5, 2024, Lenk requested  an extension of time to respond  to \nMonolithic’s motion, arguing  that Monolithic did not comply with L RCiv  12.1(c), which \nrequires the parties to meet and confer before filing a motion to dismiss.  (Doc. 34.)  \nMonolithic’s motion  was not struck,  because although Monolithic did not comply with \nLRCiv  12.1(c), “striking [the] motion to dismiss would be an inapt remedy” because it was \n“clear from the record that a curative amendment is not possible in this particular case.”  \n(Doc. 35 at 1. )  Instead, Monolithic was required to meet and confer with Lenk “regarding \nthe issues identified in its Motion to Dismiss and the possibility of a curative amendment \nrelating to those issues” and file either a certificate of consultation  (the “Certificate”)  in its \nreply brief or as a standalone notice.  ( Id. at 2.)  On November 15, 2024, Monolithic filed \nthe Certificate .  (Doc. 36.)  \nOn November 14, 2024, Lenk filed his response to the motion to dismiss.  (Doc. Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 3 of 36 \n- 4 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 37.)  On November 22, 2024, Monolithic filed its reply.  (Doc. 38.)  \nOn November 25, 2024, Lenk filed a response in opposition to the Certificate.  (Doc. \n39.)  On December 2, 2024, Monolithic filed a reply in support of the Certificate.  (Doc. \n40.) \nOn December 9, 2024, Lenk filed a motion for default against Monolithic , arguing \nthat because Monolithic did not file the Certificate with its motion to dismiss, Monolithic’s  \nmotion did not constitute a valid response to the FAC, and default was proper .  (Doc. 42  at \n2–3.)  On December 13, 2024, Monolithic filed a response, (Doc. 43), and on December \n20, 2024, Lenk filed a reply, (Doc. 44).  \nOn February 24, 2024, Monolithic filed its disclosure statement identifying \nBlackRock, Inc., (“BlackRock”) as owning 10% or more of Monolithic’s stock.  (Doc. 47 \nat 2.)  Then , on April 24, 2024, Lenk moved  for leave to amend the FAC to add BlackRock \nas a defendant .  (Doc. 48 .)  This motion is now fully briefed.  ( Doc. 49 (response) ; Doc. 50 \n(reply);  Doc. 52 ( sur-reply) .)2 \nII. MOTION FOR DEFAULT  \nLenk’s motion for default will be considered first because he argues Monolithic’s \nmotion to dismiss cannot be considered and Monolithic must be defaulted for failing to \nrespond to the FAC.  (Doc. 42 at 2 –3.)  For the following reasons, Lenk’s motion  is denied . \nA. Legal Standard  \nUnder Rule  55, “[w]hen a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is \nsought has failed to plead or otherwise defend, and that failure is shown by affidavit or \notherwise, the clerk must enter the party’s default.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a).  This Court’s \nLocal Rules provide that “[n]o motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim . . . will be \nconsidered or decided unless the moving party includes a certification that, before filing \nthe motion, the movant notified the opposing party of the issues a sserted in the motion” \nthrough personal consultation and the “parties were unable to agree that the pleading was \ncurable in any part by a permissible amendment offered by the pleading party.”  LRCiv \n \n2  On June 13, 2025, Lenk also filed a “sur -sur-reply” without authorization from the \nCourt.  (Doc. 53.)  Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 4 of 36 \n- 5 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 12.1(c).  Any motion that “does not contain the required certification may be stricken \nsummarily.”  Id. \nB. Discussion  \nIt is undisputed that  Monolithic did not comply with LRCiv  12.1(c).   (See Doc. 35 \nat 1.)   This rule  required Monolithic to meet  and confer with Lenk before filing its motion \nto dismiss, yet it did not do so.   (See Doc. 36 at 1 .)  Accordingly, Monolithic’s motion \ncould be struck for failure to comply.  See LRCiv 12.1(c).   But the Court already declined \nto do so.  (Doc. 35.)  \nThat said,  it is not  clear that Monolithic complied with the previous O rder requiring \nit to meet and confer with Lenk on the issues in the motion to dismiss.  ( Id. at 2.)  Monolithic \nproffered its November 5, 2024, email exchange with Lenk that pre-dated the previous \nOrder , (Doc. 36), but the Order required a new meet -and-confer between the parties.  (Doc. \n35 at 2.) \nStriking Monolithic’s motion is not warranted , however .  Although  LRCiv 12.1(c)  \nis mandatory as the previous Order noted, ( Doc. 35 at 1 ), in this instance only , Monolithic’s \nnoncompliance is excused , given the unique circumstances of this case.  See LRCiv 83.6 \n(“[A]ny Judge of this Court may suspend any of these Local Rules for good cause shown.”).  \nThis case has been pending since October 2023, the parties and the Court have already \nproceeded through one round of motion -to-dismiss briefing, and proceedings should not \nbe delayed any further by requiring new briefing .  Additionally, Lenk has not suggested \nany amendments he would have made to the FAC if Monolithic had complied .  See Wine \nEduc. Council v . Ariz. Rangers , 2020 WL 7352632, at *9 (D. Ariz. 2020) (declining to \nstrike motion to dismiss for failure to comply with L RCiv  12.1(c) where the movant \n“offered to withdraw the motion if . . . any deficiencies could be cured by amendment” and \nthe non -movant “declined”).   Good cause exists to consider Monolithic’s motion , LRCiv \n83.6, as it will further the “just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of” this case, Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 1.   See Hoffard v. County of Cochise , 2021 WL 2685637, at *1 n.2 (D. Ariz. \n2021) (considering a motion to dismiss on the merits, even after noncompliance with Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 5 of 36 \n- 6 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n LRCiv  12.1(c), “in the interest of judicial economy”).  \nBecause Monolithic’s motion  is not str icken and  it is undisputed that the motion was \ntimely filed, ( see Docs. 30 , 31), the motion is a valid response to the FAC.  Accordingly, \ndefault is not proper  and Lenk’s motion for entry of default is denied.  \nIII. MOTION TO DISMISS THE FAC  \nMonolithic argues the FAC has not cured the deficiencies raised in the Order \ndismissing Lenk’s  first Complaint and, in fact, “violates both of the Court’s admonitions” \nfrom the Order.  (Doc. 31 at 2 –3.)  Specifically, Monolithic  argues the \n“retaliation/whistleblower claims are predicated on [Lenk’s]  allegations of [Monolithic’s ] \nconduct during his one -year employment . . . and on his filing of the meritless Lenk I –IV \ncases that were dismissed with prejudice” and, if there is any new material, “it contains \nnothing more than pure speculation about his inability to obtain employment in 2021 -\n2022.”  ( Id. at 3.)  Further more , “even assuming Lenk could get past his pleading hurdles, \nhe has failed to exhaust administrative remedies and some of his claims are time barred.”  \n(Id. at 4.)  \nA. Legal Standard  \nThe Court liberally construes the pleadings of pro se plaintiffs.  Draper v. Rosario , \n836 F.3d 1072, 1089 (9th Cir. 2016).   “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true” and construed in a light most favorable \nto the plaintiff, “to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quotation marks omitted).  A claim is plausible if the plaintiff \npleads “factual content that allows the court to draw th e reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  In making this determination, the Court \ndoes not accept legal conclusions as true, nor does the Court consider “[t]hreadbare recitals \nof the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements.”  Id.; see \nalso id.  (“Nor does a complaint suffice if it tenders naked assertion[s] devoid of further \nfactual enhancement.” (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted)).  That said, “a \ncomplaint attacked b y a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed  factual Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 6 of 36 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n allegations.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (emphasis added).  A \n“well -pleaded complaint may proceed even if” actual proof of those facts “is improbable [] \nand . . . a recovery is very remote and unlikely.”  Id. at 556 (quotation marks omitted).  \nB. Discussion  \n1. Request for Judicial Notice  \nMonolithic’s request for judicial notice of certain documents  will be addressed \nbefore the merits of Monolithic’s motion to dismiss .  (Doc. 32.)  Monolithic requests \njudicial notice of the following:  (1) Lenk’s October 2022 charge filed with the Arizona \nCivil Rights Division (the “CRD”), (2) the July 2023 notice of right to sue from the CRD, \n(3) Lenk’s October 2023 amended charge fil ed with the CRD, (4) the CRD’s October 2023 \ndismissal notice, (5) Lenk’s November 2023 EEOC charge withdrawal notice, and ( 6) two \norders from Lenk IV .  (Id. at 1–2.)  Lenk did not oppose Monolithic’s request or dispute  \nany document’s  authenticity.  \nMonolithic ’s request to  take judicial notice of the requested documents  is granted .  \nSee, e.g. , Trigueros v. Adams , 658 F.3d 983, 987 (9th Cir. 2011)  (stating courts “may take \nnotice of proceedings in other courts, both within and without the federal judicial system, \nif those proceedings have a direct relation to matters at issue”  (citation omitted)); Doria v. \nYelp Inc. , 2024 WL 1740015, at *3 (D. Ariz. 2024) (taking judicial notice of documents \nfiled with the CRD and right -to-sue letter from the EEOC  and collecting cases in whic h \ncourts took judicial notice of EEOC filings ).   \n2. Hiring Discrimination Claims  \nLenk’s first five causes of action relate to his allegations that Monolithic \ndiscriminated against him based on  his age and his race in declining to hire him for several \npositions between 2021 and 2022.  ( See Doc. 26 ¶¶  59–71 (Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act (“ADEA”)  claims), 72 –76 (California F air Employment and Housing Act \n(“FEHA”) discrimination claim), 77 –82 ( Arizona Civil Rights Act (“ACRA”)  \ndiscrimination claim), 83 –91 (W ashington Law Against Discrimination (“WLAD”)  Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 7 of 36 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n discrimination claim).)3  Monolithic argues  these claims should be dismissed because Lenk \nhas not sufficiently pled that Monolithic’s  decision to not hire him was based on a \ndiscriminatory reason.  (Doc. 31 at 8–9.) \na. Race Discrimination Claims ( ACRA  and WLAD ) \nMonolithic contends “Lenk did not list either his race or ethnicity on [his] job \napplication,” and there is “nothing to suggest that . . . people who knew Lenk were involved \nin the decision”  not to hire him.   (Id. at 9.)  Lenk responds that Monolithic would be \nunlikely to forget him considering Monolithic “spent more than nine years . . . and more \nthan $840,000” litigating against him.   (Doc. 37 at 5 (emphasis and quotation marks \nomitted).)4 \nMonolithic is correct that Lenk has not pled sufficient facts to support an inference \nthat Monolithic declined to hire him because of his race.  A “plaintiff must prove intentional \ndiscrimination to make out a discrimination claim using a disparate treatment theory.”  \nRobinson v. Adams , 847 F.2d 1315, 1316 (9th Cir. 1987) ; see also Bodett v. CoxCom, Inc. , \n366 F.3d 736, 742 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[T]he Arizona Civil Rights Act is generally identical \nto Title VII, and therefore federal Title VII case law [is] pers uasive in the interpretation of \n[the Arizona] Civil Rights Act.” (second and third alteration s in original) (quotation marks \nomitted)); Hedenburg v. Aramark Am. Food Servs., Inc. , 476 F. Supp. 2d 1199, 1208 n.6 \n(W.D. Wash. 2007) (“In interpreting the WLAD, Washington courts rely upon cases \ninterpreting Title VII.”) ; cf. Peña v. Clark County , 2023 WL 5822421, at *5 (W.D. Wash. \n2023) (noting, however, that the WLAD “directs that its provisions shall be construed \nliberally” (quotation marks omitted) ).  Accordingly, an “employer cannot intentionally \ndiscriminate against a job applicant based on race unless the employer knows the \napplicant’s race.”  Robinson , 847 F.2d at 1316.    \nAs one application shows, Lenk did not identify his race or ethnicity , (Doc. 26 at \n34–35.), nor does Lenk allege he identified his race or ethnicity in any subsequent \n \n3  Lenk’s FEHA claims will be addressed in a separate section of this Order.  \n4  Lenk attached several exhibits to his response , (Doc. 37  at 19 –27), which  may not \nbe considered because they were not included in the FAC and are not  subject to judicial \nnotice.  See Gibson v. Cmty. Dev. Partners , 2022 WL 10481324, at * 3 n.7 (D. Or. 2022).  Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 8 of 36 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n application , (see id.  ¶¶ 9–17).  Although Lenk argues Monolithic is “certainly not  going to  \nforget” him and his race given the ir litigation history, (Doc. 37 at 5),  it is conjecture  to \nassume that this played a role in Monolithic’s hiring application process .  Accepting Lenk’s \nargument would require speculation —without any factual support —that whoever or \nwhatever5 reviewed his application knew him from his one year of employment  with \nMonolithic  almost a decade ago, (Doc. 26 at 37) , or knew of his litigation history with \nMonolithic ; independently knew his race ; and decided not to hire him because of it.   Cf. \nAli v. ServiceNow, Inc. , 2019 WL 11542365, at *4 (N.D. Cal. 2019) (dismissing claims of \nrace discrimination where the plaintiff did not allege that the “hiring managers and \ninterviewers ” who allegedly only hired individuals of a certain race “were involved in the \ndecision -making process for the positions to which he applied ” and because he had not \nalleged “anyone at [the employer] was actually aware of his national origin, race, religion, \nor age ,” noting that  the argument that the employer “deduced his religion from his last \nname and deduced his national origin from an entry on his resume [was]  speculative”).6  \nAlthough all reasonable inferences must be made in Lenk’s favor, the logical leaps \nnecessary  to bridge Lenk’s pled facts to an inference of discrimination are not reasonable.  \nSee, e.g. , Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos , 145 S. Ct. 1556, \n1565  (2025) (“Plausib ly does not mean probably, but it asks for more than a sheer \npossibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” (quotation marks omitted));  Khoja v. \nOrexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, 1008 (9th Cir. 2018) (“[T]he court [is not] \n \n5  Lenk suggests that Monolithic employs artificial intelligence to screen applicants .  \n(Doc. 26  ¶ 75; id. at 62 (warning Lenk in application process that Monolithic “may use an \nartificial intelligence algorithm to provide an initial comparison of an applicant’s \neducation, experience, and skills . . . . [to] produce[] a Profile Relevancy score, which is \nintend ed to be one of many factors that a potential employer will review in making its \ninterview decisions”).)  \n6  At times, the FAC suggests that, merely because Monolithic  employs many Asians , \nMonolithic de facto  discriminates against non-Asians .  (See Doc. 26 ¶  39 (“[Monolithic’s] \nUS Asian employment occurs at 10 times the rate of [Bureau of Labor Statistics ] \nemployment  . . .  These significant statistical deviations support prima facie discrimination; \nfurther supported by  . . . photos  [in a report]  . . . indicating the demographics they seek .” \n(citation and emphasis omitted).)  “[I]t is not self -evident that decision -makers who \nhappened to be [Asian], by virtue of their status as such, would discriminate against [Lenk] \nbased on his race  . . . and the [FAC] fails to allege factual allegations e xplaining [his] \npremise.”  See Ali, 2019 WL 11542365, at *4.  These allegations are thus speculative as \nwell.  See id.

Klemp , 2007 WL 14 68686, at *4 (D. Idaho 2007) (“[A]n inference based on speculation \nand conjecture is not reasonable.” (citation omitted)).    \nBecause there are not sufficient facts  pled in the FAC to infer Monolithic’s hiring \ndecision discriminated  on the basis of race , these theories are dismissed in the \nACRA/WLAD claims .7  Cf. Hunter -Rainey v. N.C. St ate Univ. , 2018 WL 1092963, at *3 \n(E.D.N.C. 2018) (granting summary judgment to employer on race discrimination claim \nwhere “nothing in the record show[ed] that the decisionmaker (or anyone involved in the \nprocess) discriminated against [the plaintiff] because of her race (or anything else)”);  White \nv.

Cal. 2018) (holding a plaintiff could not establish \na prima facie case of disparate treatment under Title VII where the “selecting official [did \nnot know] of Plaintiff’s race . . . at the time of the selection”) .    Lenk is not granted lea ve \nto amend th is theor y of his ACRA and WLAD claims  for the reasons addressed  later in \nthis Order.  \nTo the extent Lenk asserts  a disparate impact theory of race discrimination8 in his \nACRA and WLAD claims,  he has failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim.  To \nestablish a “prima facie case of employment discrimination using a disparate impact \ntheory,” a plaintiff must “show that a business practice, neutral on its face, had a \nsubstantial, adverse impact on some [protected] group,” typically using “statistical \nevidence showing that an employment practice selects members of a protected class in a \nproportion smaller than their percentage in the pool of actual applicants.”  Robinson , 847 \nF.2d at 1317 –18.   \n \n7  Lenk’s ACRA and WLAD claims encompass both race and age discrimination \ntheories.  (Doc. 26 ¶¶ 77–86.)  Dismissal of the race discrimination theories does not affect \nthe age discrimination theories.  \n8  Lenk’s ACRA/WLAD claim s are  not separated  into distinct disparate impact and \ndisparate treatment theories, unlike  his ADEA claims.  However, Lenk mentions disparate \nimpact in his response in connection with his race discrimination claims.  (Doc. 37 at 6.)   \nFurther, the ACRA and the WLAD recognize both theories.  Kumar v. Gate Gourmet Inc. , \n325 P.3d 193, 196–97, 204 (Wash. 2014);  Cisneros v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. , 660 P.2d \n1228, 1229 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1982).

Construing \nLenk’s allegations liberally, a policy to reach a certain number of individuals in various  \nracial groups  might  be sufficient for a disparate impact theory , cf. Ames v. Ohio Dep’t of \nYouth Servs. , 145 S. Ct. 1540 , 1545  (2025) (affirming applicability of Title VII disparate -\ntreatment provision to discrimination  against plaintiffs who are members of a majority \ngroup ), although this result is unclear , particularly on the nonspecific allegations in the \nFAC , see Smith v. City of Jackson , 544 U.S. 228, 241 (2005)  (“[I]t is not enough to simply \nallege that there is a disparate impact on workers, or point to a generalized policy that leads \nto such an impact.   Rather, the employee is responsible for isolating and identifying the \nspecific  employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical \ndisparities. ” (quotation marks omitted)); Freyd v. Univ. of Or ., 990 F.3d 1211, 1224 (9th \nCir. 2021)  (“Plaintiffs generally cannot attack an overall decisionmaking process in the \ndisparate impact context, but must instead identify the particular element or practice within \nthe process that causes an adverse impact.”  (citation omitted)) .  Compare Am. Fed’n of \nState, Cnty., & Mun. Emps., AFL -CIO (AFSCME)  v. Washington , 770 F.2d 1401, 140 6 \n(9th Cir. 1985) (holding compensation system that was the “result of a complex of market \nforces ” did not “constitute a single practice that suffice [d] to support a claim under \ndisparate impact theory ”), and Hayden v. County of Nassau , 180 F.3d 42, 51 (2d Cir. 1999) \n(“Even in the absence of specific and identified discrimination, nothing in our \njurisprudence precludes the use of race -neutral means to improve racial and gender \nrepresentation. ”), with Hung Ping Wang v. Hoffman , 694 F.2d 1146, 1149 (9th Cir. 1982) \n(noting a  specific  job requirement  that “seem[ed] on its face to have a disparate impact on \nminority applicants”  was sufficient ).   \nAnother  problem is that Lenk has not sufficiently pled causation, i.e., that such a \npolicy caused the alleged disparate impact.  See Moussouris v. Microsoft Corp. , 2016 WL \n4472930, at *10 (W.D. Wash. 2016) (dismissing disparate impact claim where the Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 11 of 36 \n- 12 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n plaintiff’s “allegations that would close [the] logical gap” between the employment \npractice and the alleged disparate impact  “[were] conclusory”).   The FAC does not contain \nany allegations that Monolithic’s E nvironmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) \nreporting is a factor in its personnel decisions.   Cf. Mompoint v. Dep ’t of Elementary & \nSecondary Educ. , 2019 WL 1921631, at *3 (D. Mass. 2019)  (“Although [the plaintiff]  does \nallege certain statistics regard [ing]  the diversity (or lack thereof) . . . , she does not plausibly \nallege how such statistics reflect the disparate impact of any particular policy or practice \nor the causal relationship between the two .”). \nAdditionally, t he FAC alleges Monolithic reported “more than two -thirds of [its] \nemployees self -identified as non -Caucasian,” ( Doc. 26  ¶ 37 (emphasis omitted)), but Lenk \ndoes not allege any facts suggesting that Monolithic hires White  employees “in a \nproportion smaller than their percentage in the pool of actual applicants,” see Robinson , \n847 F.2d at 1318.  Put another way, the FAC does not contain any allegations concerning \nthe racial breakdown of Monolithic’s applicant pool, so it cannot be inferred, from  Lenk’s \ncited statistics alone, that Monolithic’s hiring practice is unproportional  or potentially \ndiscriminatory .  Consequently, it cannot be inferred  that Monolithic engaged in any \nbusiness practice that had a “substantial, adverse impact” on members of Lenk’s race , or \nthat any such impact was caused  by Monolithic’s alleged demographics goals .  See \nRobinson , 847 F.2d at 1317 ; see also Moussouris , 2016 WL 4472930, at *10 (“Plaintiffs \nmust allege something more than the conclusory assertion that the faciall y neutral policy \nthey oppose in fact causes the disparate impact they challenge.”) . \nAccordingly, to the extent Lenk also asserts a disparate impact theory in his ACRA \nand WLAD claims , it is dismissed.   Leave to amend will not be granted, as discussed later \nin this Order.    \nb. Age Discrimination  Claims  \nAs for the age discrimination claim s under the ADEA, the ACRA, and the WLAD , \nMonolithic argues that Lenk has not “eliminate [d] an obvious alternative explanation for \nhis failure to get the job —his outdated and insufficient qualifications ,” or his lawsuits Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 12 of 36 \n- 13 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n against Monolithic.   (Doc. 31 at 3, 9 (quotation marks omitted) ; Doc. 38 at 4 .)9  Monolithic \nnotes the publicly available worldwide report cited by Lenk actually shows the “number of \nemployees in the 45+ age group [at Monolithic] steadily increased  from 2018 through \n2022, with an additional 31 such employees in 2021 and 73 more in 2022.”  ( Id.) \nLenk responds that holding a gap in an applicant’s resume against the applicant is \nitself discriminatory against older applicants.  (Doc. 37 at 4.)  He also argues that \nMonolithic’s use of graduation data was unlawful and that the requirement to provide \ngraduation data has a disparate impact on older applicants.  ( Id. at 2–3.)  Finally, Lenk \npoints to Monolithic’s “measly 4% . . . hiring of persons age 45 or older,” which he argues \nis evidence of Monolithic’s discrimination.  ( Id. at 4.)  \nThe ADEA prohibits an employer from “fail[ing] or refus[ing] to hire . . . any \nindividual or otherwise discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual’s \nage.”  29 U.S.C. §  623(a)(1).  “A litigant can establish a violation of ADEA using either of \ntwo related theories”: (1) “he can show disparate treatment —that he suffered intentional \ndiscrimination in employment because of his age,” or (2) “he can show an adverse or \ndisparate impact —that facially neutral employment practices in fact trea ted more harshly \nemployees in the protected age group.”  Cotton v. City of Alameda , 812 F.2d 1245, 1247 \n(9th Cir. 1987).  The former requires a showing of “intentional discrimination”: the plaintiff \nmust have been “between forty and seventy years of age,” he must have “applied for a \nposition for which he was qualified,” and a “younger p erson with similar qualifications \nreceived the position.”  Id. at 1248.   “In a disparate treatment case, liability depends on \nwhether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age ) actually motivated the employer’s \ndecision.”  Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins , 507 U.S. 604, 610 (1993).   The latter requires that \nthe plaintiff “show that a neutral practice had a significant discriminatory impact upon a \nprotected class.”  Cotton , 812 F.2d  at 1247.  In such instances, “statistical evidence usually \n \n9  Monolithic’s argument that Lenk’s lawsuits could have been an explanation for why \nhe was not hired seems to support  Lenk’s argument that Monolithic knew who he was in \nresolving his application.  (Doc. 31 at 3.)  Because counsel’s arguments cannot alter  the \nFAC’s deficiencies discussed above, however, this argument is not discussed further.   See \nFin. Indem. Co. v. Messick , 606 F. Supp. 3d 996, 1002 (E.D. Cal. 2022) (“New averments \nin a brief cannot cure a complaint’s shortcomings.”).  Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 13 of 36 \n- 14 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n provides the only rational means of determining whether a facially neutral employment \npractice had a discriminatory impact.”  Id.  ACRA and WLAD age discrimination claims \nare analyzed under the same framework as claims under the ADEA.  See, e.g. , Knowles v. \nU.S. Foodservice, Inc. , 2010 WL 3614653, at *3 (D. Ariz. 2010) (ACRA); Robinson v. \nPierce County , 539 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1325 ( W.D. Wash.  2008) (WLAD).  \nLenk’s disparate treatment claim  is considered first .  Although the parties quibble \nabout whether the experience on Lenk’s resume qualif ied him for the jobs he sought, (Doc. \n31 at 8; Doc. 37 at 3 –5), resolution of th ese factual issue s are not proper on a motion to \ndismiss, see, e.g. , Rat Pack Filmproduktion GMBH v. RatPac Ent., LLC , 2024 WL \n4452483, at *5 (C.D. Cal. 2024) (“The motion to dismiss stage  . . . is not the time to dive \ninto the merits of a claim or make other fact -intensive inquiries.”) ; Angelucci v. Mayorkas , \n2021 WL 4523690,  at *4 n.7 (S.D. Cal. 2021) (“[F]actual disputes are not meant to be \nresolved at the motion to dismiss stage.”) .  Lenk’s allegations that he was qualified for \nvarious roles for which he applied , based on previous experience in the same roles , must \nbe accepted as true .  (See Doc. 26 ¶¶  7–11, 15, 20 –22.) \nMonolithic also disputes Lenk’s use of Monolithic’s  worldwide employment data , \narguing that the metrics show “the 45+ age group steadily increased from 2018 through \n2022,” and argues that any comparison between its worldwide metrics and the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics for the United States labor force is “meaningless.”  (Doc. 31 at 9.)  “A \nplaintiff may use statistics to show an intent to discriminate .”  Pottenger v. Potla tch Corp. , \n329 F.3d 740, 747 (9th Cir. 2003).  But regardless of whether the data suppo rts his \nallegations, Lenk specifically pled that (1) he is over 40 years of age, (2) he applied for \nseveral jobs with Monolithic for which he was not hired, (3) he was qualified for those \njobs, and (4) younger, less qualified individuals were hired for the se roles.  (Doc. 26 ¶¶  6, \n8–11, 17 –19, 22 –24.)  Monolithic does not challenge any of these allegations.  ( See \ngenerally Doc. 31 at 9 –10; Doc. 38 at 4.)  Lenk sufficiently  pled a disparate treatment claim \nunder the ADEA.  See Cotton , 812 F.2d at 1248.  \nFurther, although Monolithic argues Lenk’s claim must fail because of an Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 14 of 36 \n- 15 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n “obvious,” “alternative explanation,” (Doc. 31 at 8 –9; Doc. 38 at 4), questions about \nwhether Monolithic had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason  are immaterial at this \nstage.  See Austin v. Univ. of Or. , 925 F.3d 1133, 1136 –37 (9th Cir. 2019) (stating that the \nMcDonnell Douglas framework is an “evidentiary standard” and is not the appropriate \nstandard at the pleading stage); Palmer v. United States , 794 F.2d 534, 537 (9th Cir. 1986) \n(the second and third steps of the McDonnell Douglas framework concern whether there \nexists a  non-pretextual,  “legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for the alleged \ndiscriminatory action ).  At this stage, Lenk need only “state a claim to relief that is plausible \non its face.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quotation marks omitted).  Even if actual proof of the \nfactual allegations in the FAC is “improbable [] and . . . a recovery is very remote and \nunlikely,” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556 (quotation marks omitted), Lenk’s disparate treatment \nallegations are sufficient to survive dismiss al.  Because Monolithic does not argue any \nother bas is for dismissal of Lenk’s disparate treatment theories , its motion is den ied as to \nLenk’s ADEA disparate treatment claim (Count One) and any disparate treatment theory \nunder the ACRA (Count Four) or the WLAD (Count Five)  premised on age , if asserted . \nConsidering Lenk’s disparate impact claim, Lenk has stated a plausible claim on its \nface.  Construing the FAC liberally, Lenk alleges that a specific practice by Monolithic —\nrequesting and utilizing graduation data —has a disparate impact on older applicants.  (Doc. \n26 ¶¶  8, 25; Doc. 37 at 2 –3.)  Lenk also alleges Monolithic’s practice of using photographs \nand testimonials on its website “favoring younger age groups” —such as only including \nphotos and testimonials from employees under 40 years of age —and “focu s[] on education \nof younger employees” also results in  age discrimination.  (Doc. 26 ¶¶  34–35.)  Lenk again \ncites Monolithic’s public reporting data, which shows a smaller p ercentage  of employees \nover 45 years of age compared to all other age groups.  ( Id. ¶¶ 26–33.) \nMonolithic only disputes whether Lenk’s cited statistics are sufficient to show \nevidence of discrimination.  (Doc. 31 at 9.)   Even if Monolithic is correct, this would not \nnecessarily be fatal to Lenk’s disparate impact claim.  See Bolden -Hardge v. Off. of Cal. \nState Controller , 63 F.4th 1215, 1227 (9th Cir. 2023) ( stating that “s tatistics are not strictly Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 15 of 36 \n- 16 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n necessary”  for disparate impact claims under Title VII ); Sanford v. Landmark Prot., Inc. , \n2011 WL 1877904, at *5 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (“The analysis of an ADEA claim is the same \nas the analysis of a Title VII claim.”) .  Moreover, Monolithic  does not address Lenk’s \nclaims that Monolithic’s use of graduation data has a disparate impact on older applicants, \nnor does it address the images and information contained on its website.   \nAccordingly, Monolithic’s motion is denied as to Lenk’s disparate impact claim \nunder the ADEA and any disparate impact theories under the ACRA and WLAD  premised \non age , if asserted.   See Indep. Towers of Wash. v. Washington , 350 F.3d 925, 929–30 (9th \nCir. 2003) (stating that courts “cannot manufacture arguments for [a party]” but instead \n“review only issues which are argued specifically and distinctly” because courts “require \ncontentions to be accompanied by reasons” (quotation marks omitted)); Greenwood v.  \nF.A.A, 28 F.3d 971, 977 (9th Cir. 1994) (holding an appellant’s challenge was “waived due \nto his failure to present a specific, cogent argument for [the court’s] consideration”) ; Kuhl \nv. McDonough , 2024 WL 3463350, at *10 (N.D. Cal. 2024) (“Rule 12(b)(6) places the \nburden of persuasion on the moving party, meaning that the party who files a motion to \ndismiss must explain why dismissal is warranted.”) . \n3. FEHA Claims  \nMonolithic next argues Lenk’s FEHA claims should be dismissed for lack of \nexhaustion of administrative remedies.  (Doc. 31 at 10 –11, 13.)  Because exhaustion is a \ncondition precedent, this issue is addressed first.  See Rodriguez v. Airborne Express , 265 \nF.3d 890, 900 (9th Cir. 2001) (“California courts describe exhaustion as a jurisdictional \nprerequisite to suit under FEHA . . . . equivalent to statutes of limitations  . . . .”). \nAs Monolithic argues, (Doc. 31 at 10), the FAC only allege s that Lenk  filed a \ncomplaint with the EEOC and received a right to sue letter in July 2023, (Doc. 26 ¶  57).  \nLenk has not alleged he filed a charge with the California Department of Fair Employment \nand Housing (“DFEH”) or received from a right -to-sue letter  from the DFEH .  See \nRodrigue v. Wal -Mart Stores, Inc. , 2019 WL 13042079, at *16 (C.D. Cal. 2019) \n(explaining administrative requirements under California law).  Nor  does Lenk dispute Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 16 of 36 \n- 17 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n that he never  filed a charge with the DF EH; rather, he  argues that because he filed a charge \nwith the EEOC, and there is a work -sharing agreement between the EEOC and California, \nhe was not required to also file a charge with the DEFH.  (Doc. 37 at 7 –8.)   \nAs Monolithic correctly notes, (Doc. 38 at 11), several courts have rejected the \nargument that an EEOC right -to-sue letter can exhaust FEHA administrative remedies.  \nMartin v. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. , 35 Cal. Rptr. 2d 181, 184 (Ct. App. 1994) (“[A]n \nEEOC right -to-sue notice satisfies the requirement of exhaustion of administrative \nremedies only for purposes of an action based on Title VII.”); see also Reynoso v. County \nof Ventura , 2022 WL 2092909, at *5 –11 (C.D. Cal. 2022) (concluding, upon review of \nCalifornia and Ninth Circuit precedent, that a plaintiff does not “bec[o]me entitled to \nreceive [a DFEH right -to-sue letter] merely by virtue of filing an EEOC charge”); Foroudi \nv. Aerospace Corp. , 271 Cal. Rptr. 3d 803, 810 ( Ct. App. 2020)  (“[T] he exhaustion of \nEEOC remedies does not satisfy the exhaustion requirements for state law claims. ”).    \nAccordingly, because Lenk does not dispute he has not filed a charge  with or \nreceived a right -to-sue letter from the DFEH , his FEHA claims  (Counts Three and Ten)  \nare dismissed.  Leave to amend is not granted because it would be futile in light of Lenk’s \nfailure to exhaust his administrative remedies.  (Doc. 37 at 8 ( Lenk admitting he  “is barred” \nfrom filing a charge with the DFEH) .)  See, e.g. , Donley v. Cooper , 2010 WL 1608883, at \n*2 (E.D. Wash. 2010) (dismissing complaint for lack of exhaustion where the plaintiff \n“admit[ ted] he . . . failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to bringing [the] \naction”);  Foroudi , 271 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 814 (affirming denial of leave to amend on futility \ngrounds where the plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies with the DFEH).  \n4. Retaliation Claims  \nLenk asserted claims for unlawful retaliation under the WLAD (Count Six), \nCalifornia Labor Code (Count Seven), Title VII (Count Eight), 42 U.S.C. §  1981 (Count \nNine), and the Sarbanes -Oxley Act (Count Twelve).10 \nMonolithic argues Lenk’s retaliation claims fail because (1) the alleged protected \n \n10  Lenk also asserted a retaliation claim under FEHA, but because it has been \ndismissed for lack of exhaustion, the merits of the claim  are not addressed . Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 17 of 36 \n- 32 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n to grant Lenk leave to amend these theories, given Lenk’s history of insufficient pleadings \nand meritless suits against Monolithic , and given Monolithic has spent almost $1 million \ndefending against them.   Denial of leave to amend is justified.  \nAll other claims and/or theories may proceed.  \nIV. MOTION FOR LEAVE TO AMEND  \nLenk seeks to amend his complaint to add BlackRock as a defendant.  (Doc. 48.)  \nHe argues that Monolithic’s identification of BlackRock in its corporate disclosure \nstatement is “of concern” because BlackRock “uses their financial leverage to drive \nESG/DEI policies onto companies they invest in,” citing several articles and website pages.  \n(Id. at 1–5.)  He claims BlackRock’s “significant ownership of [Monolithic] drove \n[Monolithic ] to follow ESG/DEI policies” for BlackRock’s  own benefit and that \nBlackRock’s  policies “may be the true source of [Monolithic’s] discrimination.”  ( Id. at 4.)  \nLenk vaguely assert s BlackRock’s “unjust influence . . . violated Title VII  and other laws.”  \n(Id. at 5.)  \nMonolithic opposes the motion, arguing that (1) Lenk violated this Court’s Local \nRules by failing to attach the proposed amended pleading , and (2) amendment would be \nfutile because (a) Lenk  “asserts nothing that would justify piercing the corporate veil to \nreach [Monolithic’s] shareholders” and  (b) Title VII only provides liability against \nemployers, not the owners or investors of such employers.  (Doc. 49 at 3 –4.) \nIn his reply, Lenk attached a proposed Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), which \nadded BlackRock to Lenk’s claims for race and age discrimination (Counts One through \nFive and Count Nine).  (Doc. 50 at 31 –36, 39 –40.)  The proposed SAC alleges BlackRock \nforce s companies in which it invests, like Monolithic, to adopt ESG or DEI policies that \ncaused Monolithic to discriminate against Lenk , so BlackRock is  vicariously liable for the \ndiscrimination against him.  (Id. at 19 –31.) \nMonolithic was given  the opportunity to file a sur -reply, (Doc. 51), which \nMonolithic filed, (Doc. 52).  Monolithic argues Lenk’s motion should be denied because \n(1) the proposed claims against BlackRock suffer from the same deficiencies as Lenk’s Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 32 of 36 \n- 33 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n claims against Monolithic, (2) BlackRock cannot be held vicariously liable in its capacity \nas a shareholder of Monolithic, and (3) even if BlackRock could be held vicariously liable, \nLenk has not alleged any facts to suggest that BlackRock engaged in any leveraging \npractices  with Monolithic specifically, when it did so, or how the policies are unlawfully \ndiscriminatory.  (Doc. 52 at 3 –6.) \nA. Legal Standard  \nRule 15 provides that the “court should freely give leave [to amend] when justice \nso requires.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).   As the term “freely” suggests, this “policy is to be \napplied with extreme liberality.”  Hoang v. Bank of Am., N.A. , 910 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th \nCir. 2018) (citation omitted).   “Although leave to amend should be given freely, denying \nleave is not an abuse of discretion if it is clear that granting leave to amend would have \nbeen futile.”  In re Cloudera, Inc. , 121 F.4th 1180, 1189 –90 (9th C ir. 2024) (citation \nomitted).  The Court also “has discretion to deny leave to amend when there are \ncountervailing considerations such as undue delay, prejudice, [or] bad faith.”  Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. U.S. Forest Serv. , 80 F.4th 943, 956 (9th Cir. 2023) (quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nB. Discussion  \nMonolithic is correct that Lenk’s proposed claims against BlackRock lack merit, so \ngranting Lenk leave to amend to add BlackRock as a defendant would be futile.  Chinatown \nNeighborhood Ass’n v. Harris , 794 F.3d 1136, 1144 (9th Cir. 2015) (stating that leave to \namend “may be denied if the proposed amendment . . . lacks merit”).13  First, Lenk’s FEHA \ndiscrimination claim (Count Three) is meritless because Lenk has not exhausted his \nadministrative remedies, as discussed above regarding his FEHA claim against Monolithic.   \n \n13  Monolithic submitted a declaration of  its Executive Vice President and Chief \nFinancial Officer, which contains statements about BlackRock’s engagement with \nMonolithic.  (Doc. 52 -1.)  This declaration may not be considered in resolving the motion \nfor leave to amend, because the “challenged pleading is to be evaluated based on its \nallegations and documents that are incorporated by reference.”  LMNO Cable Grp., Inc. v. \nDiscovery Commc ’ns, LLC , 2017 WL 5479614, at *3 (C.D. Cal. 2017) ; see also \nEntrepreneur Media, Inc. v. Roach , 2021 WL 4134836, at *7 (C.D. Cal. 2021) (rejecting \nan argument that was “grounded in the submitted declaration outside the pleadings that the \nCourt [would] not consider on a motion to amend”) .  Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 33 of 36 \n- 34 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n The race discrimination claims are also meritless for the reasons discussed in this Order, \nand Lenk does not have leave to amend.  \nSecond, Lenk could not hold BlackRock vicariously liable for the remaining claims \nLenk proposes , under the facts alleged in the proposed SAC.   Even parent companies —\nwhich the proposed SAC does not allege BlackRock is —are generally not liable for the \n“alleged discrimination of its subsidiary absent special circumstances.”  Ozkan v. Am. \nCasino & Ent. Props., LLC , 2014 WL 4105065, at *4 (D. Nev. 2014) ; see also Burnet v. \nClark , 287 U.S. 410, 415 (1932) (“A corporation and its stockholders are generally to be \ntreated as separate entit [i]es.  Only under exceptional circumstances . . . can the difference \nbe disregarded.”) ; Lusk v. Foxmeyer Health Corp. , 129 F.3d 773, 777 (5th Cir.  1997) \n(holding that the ADEA “contains no basis for disregarding the venerable corporate law \nprinciple of limited liability or for otherwise extending liability to a parent corporation for \nthe discriminatory acts of its subsidiary”) ; Sanford , 2011 WL 1877904, at *5 (“The analysis \nof an ADEA claim is the same as the analysis of a Title VII claim.”);  Knowles , 2010 WL \n3614653, at *3 (ACRA analyzed the same as ADEA); Robinson , 539 F. Supp. at 1325 \n(same for WLAD) .  The proposed SAC does not allege  facts to mak e this case the exception \nto the rule:  Lenk alleges BlackRock is inclined toward certain policies and goals , but as \nMonolithic notes, (Doc. 52 at 5 –6), Lenk does not allege any non -conclusory facts that \nBlackRock accordingly  influenced  Monolithic’s employment policies, or that BlackRock \neven had such influence as a minority shareholder.  \nFurther, even if BlackRock had exerted such influence o ver Monolithic, Lenk does \nnot allege any non -conclusory  or non -speculative  facts that any policies BlackRock \ninfluenced Monolithic to implement were in fact discriminatory or had any effect on Lenk’s  \nattempts to be hired by Monolithic.  ( See Doc. 50 at 19–20 (conclusory allegations that \nBlackRock forces companies in which it invests, and consequently Monolithic, to adopt \nundefined ESG policies that “caused” discrimination); id. at 23 –24 (conclusorily  stating \nBlackRock has “operational and financial control over [Monolithic], especially to \nimplement BlackRock’s ESG/DEI agenda” but citing to statements or articles issued at Case 2:23-cv-02083-SHD     Document 55     Filed 08/06/25     Page 34 of 36 \n- 35 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n different points in time about BlackRock’s overarching practices or goals); id. at 25 (citing \narticle that BlackRock took “voting action against . . . 22%” of non -specific companies ); \nid. at 27 (conclusorily alleging BlackRock “exercised control over essential terms and \nconditions of employment of [Monolithic’s] employees”); id. at 28 (citing letter concerning \nvoting action taken “against companies on climate  issues” (emphasis added)); id. at 29 \n(citing article asserting BlackRock “pressure[ed] utility comp anies to phase out traditional \nenergy investments”) .)   \nSimply put, Lenk alleg ations  concerning BlackRock do not  tie BlackRock to \nMonolithic’s alleged conduct apart from BlackRock’s  mere status as a minority \nshareholder.  This is not enough for Lenk’s proposed claims to be viable.   Cf. Corrigan v. \nU.S. Steel Corp. , 478 F.3d 718, 724 (6th Cir. 2007) (“A parent corporation generally is not \nliable for the acts of its subsidiary, even if its subsidiary is wholly owned .” (emphasis \nadded)).   The Court thus denies Lenk’s motion for leave to amend to add claims against \nBlackRock, without prejudice to Lenk filing a future motion for leave to amend if he can \nallege facts that would cure the deficiencies raised in this Order .14   \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED that Monolithic’s  motion to dismiss the FAC (Doc. 31) is \ngranted in part and denied in part , as follows:  \n(1) Count Eleven (UCL) is dismissed with leave to amend ; \n(2) Counts Thirteen (California blacklisting), Fourteen (Washington \nblacklisting), and Fifteen (Arizona blacklisting) are dismissed with leave to \namend ; \n(3) Counts Three and Ten (FEHA) are dismissed without leave to amend ; \n(4) Lenk’s race discrimination theories under Counts Four (ACRA) and Five \n(WLAD) are dismissed without leave to amend ;   \n \n14  Lenk’s “sur -sur-reply ,” (Doc. 53), was filed without authorization , so it will not be \nconsidered .  See, e.g. , Bond v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. Admin. , 2020 WL 2615970, at *1 n.1 \n(D. Ariz. 2020) (“Surreplies are not permitted in the District of Arizona without the court’s \napproval.”); Kuc v. MTC Fin. Inc. , 2012 WL 5269208, at *2 (D. Ariz. 2012) (“The Local \nRules do not authorize filing a surreply without leave of court.”).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion pertains to the case of Alonzo Shipp, who sought to suppress evidence obtained from his Facebook account in connection to a shooting incident. The critical legal issue is whether the search warrant for Shipp's Facebook data was overbroad or lacked specificity. Although the court acknowledged concerns regarding the warrant's breadth, it ultimately denied the motion to suppress based on the \"good faith exception\" to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the search warrant for Shipp's Facebook data was overly broad or lacked sufficient particularity under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that while the warrants raised concerns about their breadth, they fell under the \"good faith exception\" because they were not so facially deficient that the executing officers could not reasonably presume them to be valid. Hence, the motion to suppress the evidence was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine the police need to search your house because they think you did something wrong, but they didn't describe exactly what they're looking for clearly. This can be a problem because they might end up looking through your whole house without a clear reason for doing so. In this case, Alonzo Shipp wanted the court to ignore evidence found from searching his Facebook account because the search was too broad. While the court found the search a bit too wide-ranging, it decided not to throw out the evidence because the police acted in good faith, thinking they were following the rules.",

GARAUFIS, United States District Judge.\nDefendant Alonzo Shipp (\"Shipp\" or \"Defendant\") moves to suppress evidence obtained\nfrom his Facebook account. (See Mots, to Suppress (Dkt. 20); Mem. in Support of Mots, to\nSuppress (\"Mem.\") (Dkt. 20-1).)^ For the following reasons, the court DENIES Defendant's\nmotion.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Facts^\n1. Alleged Shooting\nOn or about July 20, 2018, an uimamed individual, referred to herein as John Doe, was\nshot in the vicinity of 117-26 147th Street in Queens, New York. (Compl. (Dkt. 1) ^ 2.) Doe\nthen ran south down 147th Street and east on 119th Street to the comer of 119th Avenue and\nSutphin Boulevard, where he collapsed. (Id.)\n' Shipp also moved to suppress post-arrest statements and identification evidence, or in the alternative for an\nevidentiary hearing as to whether law enforcement engaged in a deliberate two-step interrogation of Shipp, and a\nWade hearing. CSee Mem. at 5.) Only the motion to suppress the Facebook warrant (the \"Facebook Motion\") is\nbefore the court at this time. (\"See May 23,2019 Order (granting Government's request to address only the\nFacebook Motion at this time in light of the Government's representation that it would not seek to introduce post-\narrest statements or an identification of Shipp if the comt denied his motion to suppress the Facebook warrant).)\n^ The court assumes the parties' familiarity with the factual backgroimd and sets forth here only those facts relevant\nto the Facebook Motion.\n1Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 1 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>Video of the incident shows an individual wearing a white t-shirt pointing an object at\nanother individual. (1413.) A muzzle flash is visible. (Id) The video then shows Doe running\nsouth on 147th Street. (Id.)\nDoe then called 911 and stated in part; \"I've been shot... My shooter's coming to me\nright now... My shooter is on me ... My shooter is right here, my shooter is right here\" and \"I\ndon't want to die Pump, please. Please [inaudible] Pump. Pump. Pump. I don't want to die\nPump. Pump I don't want to die. Pump.\" (Id H 4, 6.)\nVideo cameras captured footage of Doe on Sutphin Boulevard. (Idl?.) The footage\nshows an individual approach Doe, take an item out of his pants or waistband, stand over Doe,\npoint an object at him, and then walk away. (Id) As he walked away, his face was visible on a\nsurveillance camera. (Id) Surveillance video of the incident also appears to show the alleged\nshooter wearing a bandage or similar object on his lower left arm. (Aff. in Supp. of an Appl. for\na Search Warrant (\"Aff.\") (Dkt. 25-1) If 7.)\nOn January 2,2019, Shipp was arrested and charged with possession of the firearm\nalleged to have been used in the July 20,2018 incident. (S^ Mem. at 6; Indictment (Dkt. 7)\nIfl.)\n2. Facebook Warrant\nOn February 8,2019, Magistrate Judge Vera M.

CSee Facebook Warrant (Dkt. 25-1) at EOF p. 17-\n22.) The warrant application was based on the affidavit of Special Agent Joanna Beck of the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (the \"Affidavit\"). (See Aff. at ECF p. 2-\n16.) The Affidavit set forth the basis for probable cause, which included the following:Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 2 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>• During a 911 call placed during the alleged shooting, the victim can be heard\ncalling the shooter \"Pump.\" (Id.)\n• Surveillance video of the incident on July 20,2018 appear to show the shooter\nwearing a bandage or similar object on his lower left arm. (Id, f 7.)\n• Shipp has admitted that he uses the nickname \"Pump.\" (Id.)\n• Publicly accessible photos, including a profile picture, on a Facebook accoimt\nbelonging to a user calling himself \"Sts Pistol Tony\" appear to be photos of\nShipp, indicating that the account may belong to Shipp. (Id, ^ 9.)\n• Individuals wish the account holder \"Happy Birthday\" on October 31, the date of\nShipp's birthday.

To date, the Government has seized several pieces of evidence pursuant\nto Attachment B-II, including;\n• Evidence demonstrating that the account belongs to Shipp.\n• A status update posted by the accormt user six days before the shooting, in which\nhe referred to himself as \"Pump,\" and a message in November 2018 in which the\naccount user told another individual to call him and stated: \"my name is pump\";\n• Messages sent by the account user six days after the shooting, in which he stated\nthat he needed money and was on the run. When asked why he was on the run,\nthe account user responded, \"I know u seen the news a shooting.\" When the\nindividual said she had not seen the news and asked where the shooting has\nhappened, the account user stated, \"119 sutphin.\" When the other individualCase 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 6 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>asked if anyone was hxut, the account user wrote, \"of course they got my pics.\"\nHe later added that he had already left town.\n• Messages sent by Defendant in November 2018, in which he forwarded a post by\nthe NYPD from September 10,2018 that included a photograph of Shipp and an\nappeal for the public to help locate him \"in regards to a nonfatal shooting.\" The\nperson to whom the account user sent the post responded, \"O, my goshhh. sigh.\"\nand the account user responded, \"I know.\" Later hi the conversation, when the\nindividual told the accovmt user that this information hurts them, the accoimt user\nwrote, \"Im hurt to cuz I was chilling into this incident.\"\n(Id. at 4-6.)\nB. Procedural History\nOn January 2,2019, Shipp was arrested and charged with possession of the firearm\nalleged to have been used in the July 20,2018 incident. (See Mem. at 6; Indictment (Dkt. 7)\n^1.) He was denied bail on January 10,2019. (See Jan. 10,2019 Min. Entry (Dkt. 4); Order of\nDetention (Dkt. 5).) Shipp was arraigned on February 1,2019 before Magistrate Judge Scanlon,\nat which point he entered a plea of not guilty. (Feb. 1,2019 Min. Entry (Dkt. 11).)\nShipp now seeks to suppress evidence uncovered from the Facebook accoimt because, he\ncontends, the warrant was overbroad and not sufficiently particular. (See Mots.; Mem.) The\nGovernment opposes the motion, arguing that the Facebook Warrant met the particularity\nrequirement and was not overbroad, and that in any case, the good-faith exception would apply.\n(Id at 12-13.)Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 7 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>II. LEGAL STANDARD\nThe Fourth Amendment explicitly commands that warrants must be based on probable\ncause and must \"particularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\nseized.\" U.S. Const, amend. IV. The warrant requirement is intended to ensure that \"those\nsearches deemed necessary should be as limited as possible.\" Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403\nU.S. 443,467 (1971). \"It is familiar history that indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted\nunder the authority of 'general warrants' were the immediate evils that motivated the framing\nand adoption of the Fourth Amendment.\" United States v. Ulbricht 858 F.3d 71,99 (2d Cir.\n2017), cert, denied. 138 S. Ct. 2708 (2018) tquoting Pavton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573,583\n(1980)). \"Those general warrants 'specified only an offense,' leaving 'to the discretion of the\nexecuting officials the decision as to which persons should be arrested and which places should\nbe searched.'\" Id. (quoting Steagald v. United States. 451 U.S. 204, 220 (1981)). The principal\ndefect in such a warrant was that it permitted a \"general, exploratory rummaging in a person's\nbelongings,\" Andresen v. Maryland. 427 U.S. 463,480 (1976) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted), a problem that the Fourth Amendment attempted to resolve by requiring the\nwarrant to \"set out with particularity\" the \"scope of the authorized search,\" Kentucky v. King,\n563 U.S. 452,459(2011).\nThe appropriate scope of a search \"is defined by the object of the search and the places in\nwhich there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.\" United States v. Ross, 456 U.S.\n798, 824 (1982). Therefore, \"[j]ust as probable cause to believe that a stolen lawnmower may be\nfound in a garage will not support a warrant to search an upstairs bedroom, probable cause to\nbelieve that undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a warrantlessCase 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 8 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>search of a suitcase.\" 14, Similarly, \"[p]robable cause to believe that a container placed in the\ntrunk of a taxi contains contraband or evidence does not justify a search of the entire cab.\" Id\nTo be sufficiently particular ruider the Foruth Amendment, a warrant must satisfy three\nrequirements. Ulbricht 858 F.3d at 99. First, \"a warrant must identify the specific offense for\nwhich the police have established probable cause.\" United States v. Galpin, 720 F.3d 436,445\n(2d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). Second, \"a warrant must describe the place to be searched.\"\nId. at 445-46 (citations omitted). Finally, the \"warrant must specify the items to be seized by\ntheir relation to designated crimes.\" Id at 446 (intemal quotation marks omitted).\nDespite their fi:equent conflation, \"[overjbreadth and particularity are related but distinct\nconcepts. A warrant may be broad, in that it authorizes the government to search an identified\nlocation or object for a wide range of potentially relevant material, without violating the\nparticularity requirement.\" Ulbricht. 858 F.3d at 102. Similarly, \"[wjhenthe criminal activity\npervades [an] entire business, seizure of all records of the business is appropriate, and broad\nlanguage used in warrants will not offend the particularity requirements.\" Id (quoting U.S.\nPostal Serv. v. C.E.C. Servs.. 869 F.2d 184,187 (2d Cir. 1989)). In determining whether a\nwarrant is overbroad, courts must focus on \"whether there exists probable cause to support the\nbreadth of the search that was authorized.\" United States v. Zemlvanskv. 945 F. Supp. 2d 438,\n464 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)\n\"Even if a warrant lacks particularity, ' [t]he fact that a Fourth Amendment violation\noccurred. .. does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary mle applies.'\" United States v. Lin,\nNo. 15-CR-601 (DLI), 2018 WL 3416524, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. July 11,2018) (quoting Herring v.\nUnited States. 555 U.S. 135, 140 (2009)). The Supreme Court has held that \"exclusion 'has\nalways been om last resort, not our first impulse,' and our precedents establish importantCase 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 9 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>principles that constrain application of the exclusionary rule.\" Herring, 555 U.S. at 140 (internal\ncitation omitted). \"Although in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an\naffidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal\ncases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\"\nUnited States v. D'Amico. 734 F. Supp. 2d 321, 359 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (quoting United States v.\nSmith. 9 F.3d 1007,1012 (2d Cir. 1993)).\nin. DISCUSSION\nA. Overbreadth and Particularity\nThe court has serious concerns regarding the breadth of Facebook warrants like the one at\nissue here.'^ The Second Circuit has observed that \"[a] general search of electronic data is an\nespecially potent threat to privacy because hard drives and e-mail accounts may be 'akin to a\nresidence in terms of the scope and quantity of private information [they] may contain.'\"\nUlbricht. 858 F.3d at 99 (quoting Galnin. 720 F.3d at 445); see also Galpin. 720 F.3d at 447\n(explaining that \"[tjhis threat demands a heightened sensitivity to the particularity requirement in\nthe context of digital searches\"). This threat is further elevated in a search of Facebook data\nbecause, perhaps more than any other location—^including a residence, a computer hard drive, or\na car—^Facebook provides a single window through which almost every detail of a person's life\nis visible.^ Indeed, Facebook is designed to replicate, record, and facilitate personal, familial.\n\" Courts have recognized a Fourth Amendment interest in the data contained in an individual's Facebook account.\nSee United States v. Mereeildo. 883 F. Supp. 2d 523, 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (noting that \"[w]hen a social media user\ndisseminates his postings and information to the public, they are not protected by the Fourth Amendment,\" but that\n\"postings using more secure privacy settings reflect the user's intent to preserve information as private and may be\nconstitutionally protected\" (citing Katz. 389 U.S. at 351-52 (1967)).\n' Modem cell phones may provide the closest analogy to a Facebook account because, as the Supreme Court\nexplained in Rilev v, California. 573 U.S. 373 (2014), mobile phone applications \"offer a range of tools for\nmanaging detailed information about all aspects of a person's hfe\" such that \"many of the more than 90% of\nAmerican adults who own a cell phone keep on their person a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives—\n10Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 10 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>social, professional, and financial activity and networks. Users not only voluntarily entrust,\ninformation concerning just about every aspect of their lives to the service, but Facebook also\nproactively collects and aggregates information about its users and non-users in ways that we are\nonly just beginning to understand. See, e.g.. Josh Constine, Facebook's new Studv app pavs\nadults for data after teen scandal. TechCrunch, Jtme 11,2019, https;//techcrunch.com/\n2019/06/11/study-from-facebook/ (describing various apps Facebook has built and launched that,\nonce installed, send all the data on a person's phone to Facebook); Sarah Frier and Todd Shields,\nZuckerberg Savs Facebook Collects Internet Data on Non-Users.

Particularly troubling,\ninformation stored in non-Facebook applications may come to constitute part of a user's\n\"Facebook accoxmt\"—and thus be subject to broad searches—^by virtue of corporate decisions,\nsuch as mergers and integrations, without the act or awareness of any particular user. See Alex\nHem, EU data watchdog raises concerns over Facebook integration. The Guardian, Jan. 28,\n2019, https ://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/j an/28/eu-data-watchdog-raises-concems-\nfrom the mundane to the intimate.\" Id at 395 (explaining that \"[t]he average smart phone user has installed 33 apps,\nwhich together can form a revealing montage of the user's life).\n11Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 11 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>facebook-integration (discussing privacy concerns arising from Facebook's plans to merge three\nmessaging networks that it owns—^Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram). It is thus\nhard to imagine many searches more invasive than a search of all the data associated with a\nFacebook account. Ct Rilev. 573 U.S. at 394 (\"The sum of an individual's private life can be\nreconstructed through a thousand photographs labeled with dates, locations, and descriptions.\").\nThe Second Circuit has cautioned that \"[b]ecause of the nature of digital storage, it is not\nalways feasible to 'extract and segregate responsive data from non-responsive data.'\" Ulbricht,\n858 F.3d 99-100 (quoting Galpin. 720 F.3d at 447 (internal quotation marks omitted)). As the\nGovernment notes, courts in this circuit have applied this rationale to Facebook data in\nupholding warrants similar to the one at issue here. (Opp'n at 9-10.) See, e.g.. United States v.\nWestlev. No. 17-CR-171 (MPS), 2018 WL 3448161, at *12 (D. Conn. My 17,2018) (in\nupholding Facebook warrant, equating Facebook information to other \"electronic evidence\" and\nasserting that \"extremely broad\" disclosure is a \"practical necessity when dealing with electronic\nevidence\"); United States v. Liburd. No. 17-CR-296 (PKC), 2018 WL 2709199, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nJune 5,2018) (upholding broad Facebook search warrant \"because of the nature of digital\nsearches\"); United States v. Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh. No. 15-CR-00116 (NGG), 2015 WL\n9450598, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 21,2015) (upholding Facebook warrant where the affidavit\nindicated that the defendant used his Facebook accoimt as a means and method of committing\nthe charged crime—attempting to join a terrorist group, and analogizing Facebook searches and\nother digital searches). However, Facebook is different from hard drives or email accounts in\nmany ways, including that the information associated with the account is categorized and sorted\nby the company—^not by the user. For this reason, Facebook is less like other areas of the\n\"digital realm, where the size or other outwardly visible characteristics of a file may disclose\n12Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 12 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>nothing about its content,\" see Galnin. 720 F.3d at 447, and more akin to a physical location, in\nwhich \"the physical dimensions of the evidence sought will naturally impose limitations on\nwhere an officer may pry: an officer could not properly look for a stolen flat-screen television by\nrummaging through the suspect's medicine cabinet, nor search for false tax documents by\nviewing the suspect's home video collection,\" id The concerns present in the search of a\nhard drive or email account—^that evidence sought could be located almost anywhere—and\nwhich necessitate broad digital search protocols do not, therefore, exist in the Facebook context.\nFor example, there is no possibility that a user could have filed an incriminating photo as a\n\"poke,\" and there is no chance that an incriminating message will be stored as a third-party\npassword or a rejected friend request. As the Eleventh Circuit has observed:\nThe means of hiding evidence on a hard drive—obscure folders,\nmisnamed files, encrypted data—are not currently possible in the\ncontext of a Facebook account. Hard drive searches require time-\nconsuming electronic forensic investigation with special\nequipment, and conducting that kind of search in the defendant's\nhome would be impractical, if not impossible. By contrast, when it\ncomes to Facebook account searches, the government need only\nsend a request with the specific data sought and Facebook will\nrespond with precisely that data. That procedure does not appear\nto be impractical for Facebook or for the government. Facebook\nproduced data in response to over 9500 search warrants in the six-\nmonth period between July and December 2015.\nUnited States v. Blake. 868 F.3d 960, 974 (11th Cir. 2017), cert, denied sub nom. Moore v.\nUnited States. 138 S. Ct. 753 (2018), and cert, denied. 138 S. Ct. 1580 (2018) (citations omitted).\nCompared to other digital searches, therefore, Facebook searches both (1) present a greater \"risk\nthat every warrant for electronic information will become, in effect, a general warrant,\" Ulbricht\n858 F.3d at 99, and (2) are more easily limited to avoid such constitutional concerns. In light of\nthese considerations, courts can and should take particular care to ensure that the scope of\nsearches involving Facebook are \"defined by the object of the search and the places in which\n13Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 13 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.\" See United States v. Ross, 456 U.S.\n798, 824 (1982); see also Blake. 868 F.3d at 974 (citations omitted) (where Facebook warrant\n\"required disclosure to the government of virtually every kind of data that could be found in a\nsocial media accoimt,\" observing that if the request before them had been more limited in time\nand limited to the crime at issue, it \"would have undermined any claim that the Facebook\nwarrants were the internet-era version of a 'general warrant'\"). In so doing, courts should be\nsensitive to the substantive differences between different tjqjes of digital data. See Rilev, 573\nU.S. at 395 (observing that \"certain types of [digital] data are also qualitatively different\").\nLike many Facebook search warrants, the warrant at issue here authorized a very broad\nsearch, but permitted the actual \"seizure\" only of certain information constituting evidence of the\ncrime of being a felon in possession after January 1,2018. (See Facebook Warrant.) The\nFacebook Warrant required the disclosure to the government of sixteen categories of information\nassociated with the Facebook accovmt, a seemingly boilerplate list apparently designed to capture\nall information associated with the account. Accordingly, Facebook provided 21,000 pages of\ninformation to the government, which included all contact and personal identifying information,\nall private messages and chat histories, all video history, all activity logs (including logs of\nactivity in associated Facebook applications), all friend requests, all rejected friend requests, all\nphotoprints, all Neoprints, and all past and present lists of friends. The Facebook Warrant even\nrequired the disclosure of information generated in connection with services that appear entirely\nunrelated to the facts in the Affidavit and the crime charged—^for example, there was no fact in\nthe Affidavit suggesting that the account holder used Facebook Marketplace, a service that can\nbe used to buy and sell items and services online, let alone that Facebook Marketplace would\n14Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 14 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>contain evidence of the charged crime of being a felon in possession or even additional evidence\nthat the account belonged to Shipp.\nMoreover, although the Facebook Warrant only permitted the government to seize\n\"evidence of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) involving ALONZO SHIPP since January 1,\n2018,\" the government was permitted to search the entire Facebook account since its creation.\n(Facebook Warrant, Attach. B-II.) \"A warrant's failure to include a time limitation, where such\nlimiting information is available and the warrant is otherwise wide-ranging, may render it\ninsufficiently particular.\" Zemlvanskv. 945 F. Supp. 2d at 464 (citation, quotation marks, and\nalterations omitted) (finding that the absence of a temporal limit on items to be searched\n\"reinforces the Court's conclusion that the [] warrant functioned as a general warrant\").\nAlthough a temporal limitation for the data being searched is not \"an absolute necessity,\" s^\nUnited States v. Hernandez. No. 09-CR-625 (HB), 2010 WL 26544, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6,\n2010) (noting that a \"temporal limitation\" is an \"indic[ium] of particularity\"), it would appear to\nhave been feasible to include such a limitation here.^ Doing so could have mitigated the court's\nconcerns about the breadth of this warrant. See Blake. 868 F.3d at 974 (observing that Facebook\nwarrants \"should have requested data only from the period of time during which [the defendant]\nwas suspected of taking part in the [charged crime]\"). For example, the Affidavit did not\narticulate probable cause to believe that a search of Shipp's rejected friend requests firom years\nearlier would reveal evidence shovdng that Shipp possessed a firearm in 2018.\nFinally, the court notes that the warrant did not set any limits on what the Government\nwas required to do with the information that they collected and searched, but did not \"seize.\"\n® Given that Facebook controls the storage and cataloging of associated data, and that digital data is generally\nsortable by date stamps, temporal limitation of Facebook searches appears feasible.\n15Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 15 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>This is concerning in light of the breadth of information that Facebook was required to provide to\nthe Government pursuant to the Facebook Warrant.

But cf. Galpin, 720 F.3d at 451 (noting that the\nSecond Circuit has \"not required specific search protocols or minimization undertakings as basic\npredicates for upholding digital search warrants,\" and declining to \"impose any rigid\nrequirements in that regard at this jvmcture\").\nIn sum, the court is concemed that Facebook warrants of the kind at issue here\nunnecessarily \"authorize precisely the type of'exploratory rummaging' the Fourth Amendment\nprotects against.\" S^ United States v. Bradburv. No. 14-CR-71,2015 WL 3737595, at *4 (N.D.\nInd. June 15,2015) (finding that warrant that did not limit the scope of a search of defendant's\nFacebook account appeared on its face to permit an \"inappropriate\" \"exploratory search\").\nIndeed, the format of the Facebook Warrant—an enumerated list of sixteen different categories\nof information associated with the account—suggests the organized nature of data associated\nwith a Facebook account. It thus provides support for Defendant's contention that the search\nauthorized by the Facebook Warrant could have been more clearly defined by its object—i^,\nevidence of possession of a firearm in 2018—^and limited to the categories of information\nassociated with the Facebook account in which there was probable cause to believe that such\nevidence might be found. (\"See Reply at 5.) ^ Galpin. 720 F.3d at 451-52 (explaining that the\n16Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 16 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>plain view exception is not available to the extent that \"digital search protocols target\ninformation outside the scope of the valid portion of the warrant,\" noting that there was little\nevidence in the record as to whether the search at issue was \"directed—^much less properly\nlimited—^to those files that would substantiate [the charged crime],\" and ordering the district\ncourt on remand to \"determine whether a search limited to evidence of a registration violation\nwould have necessitated the opening of image files or the playing of video files\").\nB. Good Faith Exception\nThat said, the court need not decide whether the Facebook Warrant violated the Fourth\nAmendment because, even if it did, the Facebook Warrant falls into the \"good faith exception\" to\nthe exclusionary rule established by United States v. Leon. 468 U.S. 897 (1984). See Blake, 868\nF.3d at 974 (declining to decide whether broad Facebook warrants violated the Fourth\nAmendment because the court formds that the good-faith exception applied). As the Second\nCircuit has noted, \"suppression is 'our last resort, not our first impulse' in dealing with violations\nof the Fourth Amendment.\" United States v. Clark, 638 F.3d 89,99 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting\nHerring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135 (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted)). The\nextent to which exclusion is justified \"varies with the culpability of the law enforcement\nconduct.\" Id (quoting Herring. 555 U.S. at 143). Thus, evidence should not be excluded where\nit was \"obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search\nwarrant.\" Id (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 922). When an officer genuinely believes that he has\nobtained a valid warrant from a magistrate and executes that warrant in good faith, there is no\nconscious violation of the Fourth Amendment, \"and thus nothing to deter.\" United States v.\nRavmonda, 780 F.3d 105,118 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Leon. 468 U.S. at 920-21).\n17Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 17 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>\"The burden is on the government to demonstrate the objective reasonableness of the\nofficers' good faith reliance on an invalidated warrant.\" Clark. 638 F.3d at 100 (citation and\nquotation marks omitted). In assessing whether it has carried that burden, the Second Circuit has\ncautioned that \"in Leon, the Supreme Court strongly signaled that most searches conducted\npursuant to a warrant would likely fall within [the] protection [of the good-faith exception].\" Id\n\"[A]gainst this presumption of reasonableness,\" the Supreme Court has identified four\ncircumstances where an exception to the exclusionary rule would not apply:\n(1) where the issuing magistrate has been knowingly misled; (2) where the issumg\nmagistrate wholly abandoned his or her judicial role; (3) where the application is so\nlacking in iadicia of probable cause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable; and (4)\nwhere the warrant is so facially deficient that reliance upon it is unreasonable.\nId.

With respect to\nthe other two parameters, the court finds that the Facebook Warrant was\\not \"based on an\naffidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence\nentirely unreasonable,\" Leon. 468 U.S. at 923 (citation and quotation marks omitted), nor was it\n\"so facially deficient— in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be\nseized—that the executing officers c[ould not have] reasonably presume[d] it to be valid,\" id.\n(citation omitted). The Affidavit articulated probable cause to search at least certain categories\nof information or services associated with the Facebook account, and as the Government notes,\nother district courts have declined to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to facially similar\nwarrants. e^, Liburd. 2018 WL 2709199, at *3; Westlev. 2018 WL 3448161, at *12; Pugh.\n2015 WL 9450598.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The United States District Court for the District of Columbia denied Apple Inc.'s motion to intervene in the antitrust case against Google LLC. Apple sought to intervene to protect its contractual rights with Google in light of potential remedies proposed by the plaintiffs that could affect these agreements. The court found Apple's motion untimely, but allowed Apple to participate as amicus curiae and submit a post-hearing brief.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Apple Inc.'s motion to intervene as a defendant in the remedial phase of the antitrust litigation against Google was timely under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that Apple's motion was untimely due to the significant delay between the inception of the suit and Apple’s motion to intervene, and the lack of immediate action once Apple recognized a potential inadequacy of representation of its interests. However, Apple was permitted to participate as amicus curiae and submit a post-hearing brief.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine there's a big game between two teams, and Apple wants to join as a player right before the last minute of the game. The referee says it's too late because Apple should have joined earlier when they first saw that the game could impact their scorecard. But the referee allows Apple to sit on the side, watch closely, and share its thoughts after the game ends.",

Apple’s Mot. for Limited \nIntervention, ECF No. 1111 [hereinafter Apple’s Mem.].  Apple seeks intervention as of right or , \nalternatively,  permissive intervention to protect its “property interest in its existing contract with \nGoogle and in its ability to enter into future contracts with Google.”  Id. at 6.  The United States \nand Colorado Plaintiff States oppose d Apple’s motion; Google took no position on it.  Apple’s \nmotion ripened on January 15, 2025, and the court heard argument two days later.  See Tr. of \nJan. 17, 2025 Status Conf. Proc., ECF No. 1147 [hereinafter Jan. 17, 2025 Tr.], at 30–77. Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 1 of 192 Because Apple’s motion is untimely , the court must deny it .  The court, however, will \npermit Apple to participate as amicus curiae  and file post-hearing submission s to ensure \nconsideration of Apple’s views when  crafting the remedial decree. \nI. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 governs intervention as of right and  permissive \nintervention, both of which require a timely motion .  See NAACP v. New York , 413 U.S. 345, 365 \n(1973) (“Whether intervention be claimed of right or as permissive, it is at once apparent, from \nthe initial words of both Rule 24(a) and Rule 24(b), that the application must be ‘timely.’  If it is untimely, intervention must be denied.”); United States v. Brit. Am. Tobacco Australia Servs., \nLtd., 437 F.3d 1235, 1238 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (describing timeliness as a “threshold” requirement under Rule 24). \nThe timeliness of a motion to intervene is committed to the “sound discretion” of the \ndistrict court and must be “judged in consideration of all the circumstances.”  NAACP, 413 U.S.  \nat 366; Roane v. Leonhart , 741 F.3d 147, 151 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Smoke v. Norton, 252 \nF.3d 468, 471 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).  When  making this determination , the D.C. Circuit has instructed \ncourts to “especially weigh []” four factors : (1) the “time elapsed since the inception of the suit”; \n(2) “the purpose for which intervention is sought”; (3) “the need for intervention as a means of preserving the applicant’s rights”; and (4) “the probability of prejudice to those already parties in the case.”  Smoke, 252 F.3d at 471 (quoting United States v. AT&T , 642 F.2d 1285, 1295 \n(D.C.  Cir. 1980) ).  As discussed below, a ll four factors weigh against finding that Apple timely \nsought to intervene in this case. Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 2 of 193 II. \nA. Time Elapsed  \nAt the threshold, the parties dispute the point from which timeliness is measured .  \nApple contends that the clock starts  ticking “when the ‘potential inadequacy of representation \n[comes] into existence.’”  Apple’s Mem. at 13 (alteration in original) (quoting Smoke , 252 F.3d \nat 471, and citing Amador Cnty. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior , 772 F.3d 901, 904 (D.C. Cir. 2014)).  \nApplying that standard here, Apple asserts that the relevant starting point is when Plaintiffs filed \ntheir Proposed Final Judgment (“PFJ”) on November 20, 2024.  Apple’s Mem. at 14. \nPlaintiffs frame the inquiry slightly differently.  In their view , “[t]imeliness is measured \nfrom when the prospective intervenor knew or should have known that any of its rights would be directly affected by the litigation.”  Roeder v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 333 F.3d 228, 233 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); Pls.’ Mem. in Opp’n to Apple’s Mot., ECF No. 1121 [hereinafter Pl s.’ Opp’n], at 6–7.  Under that standard, Plaintiffs argue, Apple’s \nmotion comes four years too late, because Apple was on notice from the outset of this case, in \nlate 202 0, that its contractual rights were implicated.  Pls.’ Opp’n at 6.  \nThe D.C. Circuit recently  articulated  a third variation.  Quoting Supreme Court precedent, \nit said that “‘[t]he most important circumstance relating to timeliness ’ is whether a party ‘sought \nto intervene as soon as it became clear’ that its ‘i nterests would no longer be protected by the \nparties in the case. ’”  Campaign Legal Ctr. v. FEC , 68 F.4th 607, 610 (D.C. Cir. 2023)  (quoting \nCameron v. EMW Women’s Surgical Ctr., P.S.C., 595 U.S. 267, 279–80 (2022)) ; see id.  at 610 \n(applying Smoke ’s “potential inadequacy” standard  to distinguish the instant action ). \nRegardless of how the timeliness inquiry is framed, the court finds that Apple unduly \ndelayed filing its motion.  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 3 of 194 Rights Directly Affected.   Apple does not dispute that it knew or should have known since \nthis suit’s inception that its contractual rights would be directly affected.  See Reply  in Supp. of \nApple’s Mot., ECF No. 1135 [hereinafter Apple’s Reply], at 3 –7 (disputing only the proper \nstandard for measuring timeliness).  Nor could it.  As Apple itself acknowledges , exclusive search \ndistribution agreements, including Apple’s Information Services Agreement (“ISA”) with \nGoogle, are at the heart of this antitrust action , and have been since the beginning.    See Apple’s \nMem. at 7 (asserting a protectable property interest in “its contractual rights under the ISA and \nits right to enter future contracts with Google”); id. at 3 ( recognizing that “Plaintiffs alleged [in \ntheir complaints ] that Google engaged in anticompetitive conduct via exclusionary agreements to \n‘secure default status for its general search engine’”).   Furthermore, Plaintiffs’ complaints made \nclear the risks th is litigation posed for Apple.  Plaintiffs indicated that they might seek structural \nremedies and injunctive relief to put an end to Google’s anticompetitive conduct —relief that \nwould limit  Apple’s ability  to contract with Google  now and in the future.  See United States \nCompl., Case  No. 20- cv-3010, ECF No. 1, ¶ 194 (requesting that the court “[e]nter structural \nrelief” and “[e]njoin Google from continuing to engage in the anticompetitive practices described herein”); Colo. Pl. States Compl., Case No. 20- cv-3715, ECF No. 3, ¶ 233 (seeking “structural \ndivestitures” as well as  relief addressing harms from “agreements that limit the distribution to \nand/or use of potential or competitive general search engines by consumers”). \nUsing the inception of this suit in October 2020 as the relevant starting point, Apple waited \nover four years before moving to intervene.  Such an extensive delay weighs heavily against \ntimeliness.  \nPotential Inadequacy Developed.  Apple responds that its motion would have been denied \nhad it moved to intervene when this  case was first filed (and its interests were first implicated), Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 4 of 195 because at that point its interests were still adequately represented by Google.  Apple’s Reply at \n4–5.  According to Apple, the divergence in interests did not arise until the remedial stage, when \nPlaintiffs’ PFJ revealed that they might seek remedies that “go well beyond the ISA” and “exceed \nthe bounds of this Court’s liability decision” “ by requiring a major structural remedy—the \ndivestiture of Google Chrome —and specifically targeting Google’s contractual relationship with \nApple.”1  Apple’s Mem. at 1, 4.  More specifically, Apple argues that Plaintiffs’  PFJ—in \n“prohibit[ing] Apple and Google from agreeing to even standard- fare revenue share agreements \nthat Apple maintains with every other [ general search engine] provider  . . . for 10 years” and \n“threat[ening] to reshape Google’s business in other ways,” including “the spinoff of its Chrome browser”—may reduce Google’s incentive to “defend[] the right for Apple to receive commercial value for distributing third -party search to its users” and prompt Google to focus its efforts on  \nremedies  “that may more directly impact its own operations.”  Id. at 14.  In short, Google might \nstop paying Apple, and Google might not “offer a full -throated defense” of the ISA or Apple’s \nright to pursue future agreements  with  Google.  Id.  \nThe problem with Apple’s argument is that these potential inadequacies materialized  a \nfull six weeks  earlier, when Plaintiffs filed their Proposed Remedy Framework on October 8, \n2024.  Pls.’ Proposed Remedy Framework, ECF No. 1052.  In that document, Plaintiffs identified four broad categories of remedies , one of which —“search distribution and revenue sharing” —\nencompassed  “remedies that would, among other things, limit or prohibit default agreements, \npreinstallation agreements, and other revenue -sharing arrangements related to search and search -\nrelated products[.]”  Id.  at 4–6.  Plaintiffs  also stated  that they were considering “structural \nremedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to \n \n1 The parties’ Revised Proposed Final Judgments, which will be the subject of the evidentiary hearing scheduled to \nbegin on April 22, 2025, are due by March 7, 2025.   Scheduling Order, ECF No. 1043, at 2.  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 5 of 196 advantage Google search and Google search- related products and features,” and observed that \n“Google’s longstanding control of the Chrome browser, with its preinstalled Google search \ndefault, significantly narrows the available channels of distribution and thus disincentivizes the emergence of new competition.”  Id.  at 6 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nCiting Plaintiffs’ framework, news outlets widely reported that the Justice Department \nwas weighing a breakup of Google.\n2  See NAACP, 413 U.S. at 366 (considering “an informative \nFebruary article in the New York Times discussing the controversial aspect of the suit ” when \nassessing timeliness) .  Google itself  interpreted Plaintiffs’ framework that way.3  Thus, Plaintiffs’ \nProposed Remedy Framework laid bare the very cleavage that Apple claims  is the reason Google \ncan no longer adequately represent its interests  in this case .  Yet Apple waited 76 days —until \nDecember 23, 2024—to seek intervention. \nSeventy -six days is lengthy, even under Apple’s own cases  granting intervention.  \nSee Cameron v. EMW Women’s Surgical Ctr., P.S.C., 595 U.S. 267, 280 (2022) (motion filed \ntwo days after learning that the existing party would not continue to defend the challenged law); Dimond v. D istrict of Columbia , 792 F.2d 179, 193 (D.C. Cir. 1986)  (motion filed two days after \nthe district court clarified the effect of its ruling ); United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.S. \n385, 390, 394 (1977) (motion filed 18 days after entry of final judgment  and learning that the \nexisting parties did not intend to file an appeal) ; Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Costle , 561 F.2d 904, \n \n2 See, e.g. , Eva Dou & Aaron Schaffer, Justice Dept. Sees Google Breakup as a Possible Remedy in Antitrust Case , \nWash.

Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 6 of 197 907 (D.C. Cir. 1977)  (motions filed within 23 days of receiving notice of the settlement \nagreement); Roeder , 333 F.3d at  233 (motion filed “ less than thirty days ” after receiving  notice \nof the potential conflict ); Karsner v. Lothian, 532 F.3d 876, 886 (D.C. Cir. 2008)  (motion filed \n“less than one month” after petition to confirm the  stipulated award ); Ctr. for Food Safety v. \nConnor , No. 8- cv-484 ( JSW ), 2009 WL 4724033, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2, 2009) (motion filed \n“less than one month” after decision on the parties’ cross -motions for summary judgment and \nbefore the remedies portion had begun); Benjamin ex rel. Yock v. Dep’t of Pub. Welfare of \nPennsylvania, 701 F.3d 938, 950 (3d Cir. 2012) (motions filed after  receiving notice of the \nsettlement agreement, which had been preliminarily approved 67 days before  the second motion  \nwas filed ). \nApple’s delay is even more pronounced when “cast against the backdrop of ” this \nparticular case.   Moten v. Bricklayers, Masons & Plasterers, Int ’l Union of Am., 543 F.2d 224, \n228 (D.C. Cir. 1976) .  Seventy- six days  comprises nearly half  (49%) of the remedies -phase fact \ndiscovery period, which commenced on September 26, 2024, and will end on February 28, 2025.   \nScheduling Order, ECF No. 1043 [hereinafter Scheduling Order] , at 1 –2.  And it amounts to \nnearly  one- third  (31%) of the remedies phase as a whole.  Id.  at 1 (setting September 26, 2024 \nstart date  for fact discovery ); Amended Scheduling Order, ECF No. 1145 [hereinafter Am. \nScheduling Order] , at 1  (setting May 30, 2025 end date for closing arguments ). \nFurthermore, this court has been clear from the first status conference following the \nliability decision , held on September  6, 2024, that the remedies  phase would need to proceed on \na compressed  schedule .  See Tr. of Sept. 6, 2024 Status Conf. Proc., ECF  No. 1040, at  6:14–7:3 \n(stating that the remedies decision  must be issued by early August  2025, to preserve the court’s Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 7 of 198 institutional knowledge about this case ); id. at 29:6 -18 (stating that closing arguments must be \nheld no later than  June 1, 2025, to give the court enough time to write its opinion ). \nThe court’s September 18, 2024 Scheduling Order  reflected that imperative.  The court \nallotted eight months for the entire remedies phase, from late September 2024 to late May 2025, \nbased on the parties’ representations, the court’s own schedule, and the public ’s interest  in prompt \nresolution of this matter .  That tight timetable necessarily left little breathing room between \ndeadlines (a fact the parties do not hesitate to mention when raising discovery disputes with the \ncourt).   And as the court’s order clearly indicated, those deadlines were unlikely to move.  \nSee Scheduling Order at 3 (stating that “[m] otions for extension of time are discouraged”). \nSince then, the court  has told parties and non- parties alike that “we, frankly, just don’t \nhave the luxury of [  ] time here” and has ordered them to produce documents on an expedited \nbasis .  Tr. of Dec. 13, 2024 Status Conf. Proc., ECF No. 1096, at 13:4-20; see also Tr. of Oct. 24, \n2024 Status Conf. Proc., ECF No. 1060, at 23:2-6 (considering the “fairly compressed time \nperiod” for discovery when resolving discovery disputes) .  The court  has also  informed  Plaintiffs \nthat, “if there ’s going to be a reevaluation of the remedies that are being  requested” by the new  \nadministration, “ it needs to be done quickly and promptly; the trial is not going to move for that \npurpose [.]”  Tr. of Nov. 26, 2024 Status Conf. Proc., ECF No. 1081 [hereinafter Nov. 26, 2024 \nTr.], at 76:21–77:3. \nDespite the court’s repeated indications that time is  of the essence, Apple did not act  \nexpeditiously.  As noted, it waited 76 days after Plaintiffs filed their remedies framework before seeking intervention on the eve of Christmas Eve.  And when it finally did move to intervene , it \ndid not seek expedited resolution of its motion.  Nor did it oppose Plaintiffs’ request for more \ntime to file their response  given “the multiple intervening federal holidays  between Apple ’s Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 8 of 199 motion and the deadline for Plaintiffs ’ response .”  Consent Mot. for Extension of Time, \nECF No. 1120, at 1 . \nTo sum up: Apple knew (or should have known) from the outset of this litigation, in late \n2020, that this suit would directly  affect its contractual rights .  Apple knew (or should have \nknown) since October 8, 2024, when Plaintiffs filed their Proposed Remedy Framework, that the \nremedies sought could be expansive in scope and, consequently, that Google may not be capable \nof adequately defending Apple’s interests  during the remedial  phase of this litigation .  And Apple \nknew (or should have known) that  waiting two -and-a- half months to intervene in a proceeding \nscheduled to last  just eight months altogether would constitute a significant delay.  The time \nelapsed therefore weighs against the timeliness  of Apple’s motion. \nB. Purpose of Intervention  \nApple states that its purpose in intervening is “to ensure that this Court has the complete \nrecord required to issue a fair and effective remedial decree.”  Apple’s Mem. at 2 ; accord Jan. 17, \n2025 Tr. at 50:11- 13 (Apple’s counsel affirming that Apple is “really intervening because we \nthink Apple  has information that is going to be of service to the Court  in reaching a proper \nremedy ”).  More specifically , Apple seeks intervention on a “ limited ” basis “to present only two \nor three witnesses, engage in limited cross -examination at the remedies proceeding to the extent \nother witnesses address remedies relating to Apple, and participate alongside Google in briefing \nand arguing issues before the Court insof ar as they impact Apple.”  Apple’s Mem. at 15.  Apple’s \nevidence and arguments would cover at least three topics: (1) Apple’s intentions regarding \ngeneral search ; (2) the proposed remedies’ effects on Apple ’s commercial relationship with \nGoogle and on Apple’s customers ; and (3) the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence landscape.  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 9 of 1910 Id. at 18 –19 (leaving open the possibility that Apple would “respond to any additional points that \nmay arise during the trial of the remedies phase and directly impact Apple’s interests”).  \nDuring oral  argument, Apple elaborated on the scope of its intervention.  Regarding \ndiscovery, Apple stated that it “would not be issuing written discovery requests,” but “would seek \nto attend depositions going forward and potentially ask limited questions at the end of the  \ndepositions [.]”  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 51:3- 8.  As  to witnesses, Apple clarified  that it intended to \ncall three in total, including an expert, which  would require adding “a couple of additional days ” \nto the evidentiary hearing.  Id.  at 51:9–52:5.  Finally , with respect to post -hearing submissions, \nApple expressed “definite[] interest[] in proposing a remedy,” in addition to filing  a post -hearing \nbrief  and participating in closing arguments  (as stated  in its motion).  Id. at 52:10-14; Apple’s \nMem. at 15.   Apple further represented  that it is “ not interested in weighing in on the entire \nbreadth of the  proposed final judgments” submitted by the parties , but did not  specify  which \nremedies  it believes would affect  Apple’s interests  and, therefore, which remedies it intends to \nweigh in on.  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 52:14-19. \nAs a preliminary matter, the court doubts that the scope of Apple’s  intervention is truly as \ncircumscribed as it believes.   Apple insists that its “involvement in the proceedings” would be \nconfined “to the extent the remedy affects Apple,” Apple’s Reply at 2, but that hardly imposes a \nmeaningful limitation.   See United States v. Heinz , 790 F.3d 365, 367 (2d Cir. 2015)  (“The verb \n‘to affect’ expresses a broad and open -ended range of influences.”  (alteration and citation \nomitted)).   Is the court to defer to Apple’s own judgment as to which witnesses’  testimony or PFJ \nterms  “affect” Apple?  Or is the court to adjudicate that question each time Apple wishes to \nparticipate?  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 10 of 1911 In any event, Apple, by its own telling, seeks  to present “evidence and argument .”  \nApple’s Mem. at 19; accord  id. at 1 (“Apple must be able to present facts and arguments  \nconcerning [Plaintiffs’] PFJ’s actual effects on competition[.] ”).  That is the very purpose the \nD.C. Circuit has suggested would render intervention untimely where, as here, the movant \n“permitted significant time to elapse”  before filing its motion .  United States v. AT&T , 642 F.2d \n1285, 1294–95 (D.C. Cir. 1980)  (stating  that “ intervention would be untimely” “[h]ad [the \nputative intervenor] sought to intervene for the purpose of presenting evidence or argument ,” \nrather than “for the limited purpose of taking an appeal”).  \nWhat’s more, Apple has not established that the information it wishes to present is any \ndifferent than that the court already considered —and largely credited —during the liability phase.  \nTo describe the content of its proposed “testimony, documents, and briefing,” Apple submit ted a \ndeclaration from Edd y Cue , Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services .  Apple’s Mem. at 18–19; \nDecl. of Eddy Cue, ECF No. 1111- 1, ¶ 1; see also Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 51:16 (Apple’s counsel \nconfirming that Apple intends to call Cue as a witness  if granted intervention) .  Cue was one of \ntwo Apple witnesses to testify at the liability trial ( over Apple’s vehement opposition) , and he is \ncurrently included on Google’s witness list for the remedies hearing.  Apple’s Mem. at 4; Jan. 17, \n2025 Tr. at 44:18 -19; see Apple’s Mot. to Quash Trial Subpoenas, ECF No. 643, at 3 (“ The parties \nshould not be permitted to require Apple’s executives or this Court to undergo the burden presented by live testimony in this case when their deposition testimony could be reviewed by the Court in camera .”). \nAs the court observed during oral argument, however, the statements in Cue’s declaration \n“tracked perfectly  with” Cue’s testimony at trial.   Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 53:16 -21.  Based in part on \nhis testimony, and the testimony of one other Apple witness, the court found that Apple has Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 11 of 1912 business reasons  beyond the loss of revenue share to stay out of the general search services \nmarket —the very fact Apple seeks to emphasize at the remedial stage.

Op.],  at 104, 241–42; see Apple’s Mem. at 1 ( asserting that \n“Apple must be able to present facts and arguments concerning [Plaintiffs’]  PFJ’s actual effects \non competition,” including “evidence dispelling the PFJ’s erroneous assumption that, absent the \nISA, Apple will  enter the general search market ”); Apple’s Reply at 2 (arguing that intervention \nis warranted because “ only Apple can explain that it has no intention of entering the general \nsearch market, regardless of the injunction’s terms ”); Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 57:6- 12 (Apple’s \ncounsel stating that the court’s remedies decision “presumably will depend, in not insignificant \npart, on assumptions about Apple ’s own behavior with respect to  how the remedy would affect \nits incentives to enter the  search market or not into the future ,” and stressing that “[o] nly Appl e \nis in a  position to ensure that the record is complete on that ”). \nApple responds that the market has changed since the court made its liability \ndetermination.  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 54:3- 17.  Maybe so.  But Apple offer s no reason why party \nstatus  is necessary  to present such evidence, especially when Google is likely to call Cue as a \nwitness .4 \nApple’s case authorities do not help its cause.   According to Apple, “[c]ourts  routinely \npermit limited intervention to allow affected parties to participate in remedial proceedings in similar circumstances.”  Apple’s Mem. at 6 , 15 (citing cases).  But none of the cases  Apple cites  \n \n4 Nor is the court convinced that Google lacks incentive to make Apple’s position known to the court.  G oogle’s \nProposed Final Judgment specifically authorizes revenue share agreements  with Apple (and other browser developers) \nin exchange for setting Google Search as the default general search engine, while permitting Apple to reevaluate such \nagreement s on an annual basis and even promote rival products  across devices and browser settings.  Google’s \nProposed Final Judgment, ECF No. 1108- 1, at 4 –5.  Apple nowhere explains why Google’s proposal does not align \nwith its stated interests.  See Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 60:7 -15.  ( Indeed , Google’s proposal would arguably put Apple in a \nbetter position than it is today. )  And when given the opportunity at oral argument to articulate how its proposed \nremedy would differ  from Google’s, Apple demurred.  See id. at 59 :12–60:25 . Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 12 of 1913 involved an antitrust enforcement action, and none involved a remedial phase featuring extensive \ndiscovery and a contested evidentiary hearing.  See Hodgson v. United Mine Workers of Am. , \n473 F.2d 118, 126, 129–30 (D.C. Cir. 1972)  (intervention granted to comment on proposed decree  \ndissolving unlawful trusteeships in labor case); Costle , 561 F.2d at 906–08, 906 n.7 (intervention \ngranted  to participate in implementation and oversight of EPA settlement agreement , where the \ncourt had earlier allowed eight intervenors ); Forest Conservation Council v. U.S. Forest Serv., \n66 F.3d 1489, 1491–93, 1496 (9th Cir. 1995)  (intervention granted, where timeliness was \nundisputed, to present evidence weighing against proposed injunction prohibiting timber sales \nand other forest management activities ), abrogated on other grounds by Wilderness Soc. v. U.S. \nForest Serv. , 630 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir. 2011) ; Humane Soc’y of the United States v. U.S. Dep’t of \nAgric. , No. 19- cv-2458 (BAH), 2023 WL 3433970, at *1–2, *8 (D.D.C. May 12, 2023)  \n(intervention granted to submit cross -motion and reply brief addressing whether federal animal \nwelfare rule should be revived) ; Ctr. for Food Safety , 2009 WL 4724033, at *1–3 (intervention \ngranted  in NEPA suit to address  whether injunction should issue and appropriate scope of \ninjunctive relief, where the court had already  permitted 13 intervenors and the remedies portion \nhad not yet begun). \nThe closest Apple comes is Benjamin ex rel. Yock v. Department of Pub lic Welfare of \nPennsylvania, an out -of-circuit case in which the court of appeals held  that appellants  should have \nbeen granted intervention as of right to fully participate in a fairness hearing on a  proposed class -\naction settlement agreement , instead of merely allowed  to submit objections and question the \nparties’ witnesses.  701 F.3d 938, 941–42, 946 (3d Cir. 2012) .  Apple , however, offers no \nexplanation as to how a fairness hearing in a class -action lawsuit is similar to a contested \nevidentiary hearing in an antitrust case, beyond the fact that both take place at the remedies  stage.   Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 13 of 1914 See Apple’s Mem. at 6.  Moreover, the circumstances  in Benjamin are clearly distinguishable .  \nNo party opposed intervention  on timeliness grounds.  Benjamin, 701 F.3d at 949 ( explaining that \ntimeliness was contested only as to class certification , not the settlement agreement).  \nMore  importantly , there was no finding of prejudice to the existing parties.  Id. at 951; see infra  \nPart II.D  (finding prejudice in this case).  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the purpose for which Apple seeks intervention weighs against \nthe timeliness of its motion. \nC. Need for Intervention  \nThe need for intervention to protect  Apple’s contractual rights likewise weighs against \ntimeliness, as the court will afford Apple an opportunity to be heard through post -hearing \nsubmissions. \nD. Prejudice to Existing Parties  \nThe D.C. Circuit has called  the probability of  prejudice “the most important  \nconsideration” in determining  timeliness.  Roane , 741 F.3d at 152.  That is because “the \nrequirement of timeliness is aimed primarily at preventing potential intervenors from unduly \ndisrupting litigation, to the unfair detriment of the existing parties.”  Id.  at 151. \nIn accordance with these principles , courts in this Circuit have consistently denied \nintervention where it would likely require additional discovery, necessitate further proceedings, \nor delay resolution of the case .  See, e.g., Amador Cnty. v. U.S. Dep’t  of the Interior , 772 F.3d \n901, 902, 906 (D.C. Cir. 2014)  (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in \nfinding that  “intervention would cause prejudicial delay” where the putative intervenor sought to \nintervene for the “ limited purpose ” of filing a Rule 19 motion because t he district court “would \nneed to accept briefing on the [ ] motion, hear argument, and rule on the motion”) ; Love v. Vilsack, Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 14 of 1915 304 F.R.D. 85, 91 (D.D.C. 2014)  (finding the motion untimely because the “ litigation [was]  quite \nadvanced ” and “[i] ntervention would require further proceedings to address new issues and \npotentially new factual development ”), aff’d , No. 14- 5185, 2014 WL 6725758 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 18, \n2014); Bethesda Health, Inc. v. Cohran, No. 18- cv-875 (BAH), 2021 WL 8323602, at *6 (D.D.C. \nFeb. 16, 2021)  (concluding that “JMH’s intervention would likely prejudice the existing parties ,” \n“[d]espite the purportedly limited remedial purpose for which intervention [was]  sought,” because \n“adding JMH as an intervenor -plaintiff at this stage would necessarily require additional \ndocumentation and review” and thereby result in delay); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. \nRaimondo, No. 18- cv-112 (JEB), 2021 WL 2823102, at *4 (D.D.C. July 7, 2021)  (ruling that  \n“allowing intervention at this juncture would unduly interfere with the parties ’ right to a timely \nresolution of this matter ”); see also  Roane , 741 F.3d at  152 (granting intervention in part because \n“adding Paul as a party would have required no additional factual development” ). \nAll three types of prejudice are likely to occur here .  For starters, just because Apple has \nopted to forgo written  discovery does not mean the existing parties will.   Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 51:3-\n4.  Only one Apple witness (Cue) is included on the parties’  initial witness lists—meaning the \nparties  will need to request documents from and depose one additional (unidentified) fact witness .  \nId. at 32:2-5, 44:18- 19.  What’s more, the third witness is an (as-yet-unnamed) expert on “Apple’ s \neconomic interests ,” id. at 51:9-13, whose designation will generate discovery obligations and \ndemands.  Apple will be required to make disclosures under Rule 26(a)(2), which are likely to be substantial, i f the liability -phase expert reports are any guide.  The parties will then have to devote \nconsiderable time and resources to respond to Apple’s expert’s opinions.  At  minimum, Apple ’s \nexpert will have to be deposed, and the parties might also seek to cross -designate a rebuttal expert \nand demand additional discovery directly from Apple. Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 15 of 1916 Apple similarly fails to account for  the parties’ needs during the evidentiary hearing.  \nAt oral argument, Apple estimated that its involvement would add only “a couple of additional \ndays” to the schedule .  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 52:5.  Apple based that estimate on seven hours for \ndirect examination of its own  witnesses plus four hours for cross -examination  of “certain” party \nwitnesses (though Apple noted that the extent of its cross -examination, like other aspects of its  \nparticipation, would depend on which witnesses “implicate d” its interests).  Id. at 51:20–52:4 .  \nApple ’s estimate , however,  does not include  the time it will take Plaintiffs and Google to cross -\nexamine Apple’s three witnesses.   The court has already set aside the maximum number of days \nit has available for the evidentiary hearing —14 days in total, leaving 7 days per side .5  Any \npresentation by Apple will necessarily encroach upon the parties’ time to present their own cases.   \nThus, while t he court appreciates Apple’s “commit[ment] to following this Court’s \nschedule for the remedial phase,” Apple’s Reply at 2, even “limited” intervention would come at \nthe parties’ expense.  By  this point  in the litigation —just one month before  the close of fact \ndiscovery and less than three months until the evidentiary hearing—the parties have structured \ntheir discovery, served their written requests, disclosed their initial witness lists, scheduled  their \nwitness depositions, and reviewed hundreds of thousands of documents.  See Scheduling Order.  \nAnd they have done it all within the strict confines of the court’s Scheduling Order —with still \nmore yet to come .  See Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 108:8-9, 108:24–109:8 (parties’ counsel stating that \nnumerous document productions are forthcoming and 15 Google witness depositions, plus \nmultiple  third -party witness depositions, are scheduled for February 2025); id. at 109:13-15 \n \n5 Initially , the court set aside nine days for the hearing .  Scheduling Order at 3 .  Midway through discovery and \nfollowing submission of the parties’ Proposed Final Judgments, Plaintiffs sought three additional days, while Google \nrequested  11 more .  Joint Status Report, ECF No. 1125, at 23– 26.  The court added five.  Am. Scheduling Order at 1.  \nEven that was challenging.  See Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 101:24 –102:13 (describing the court’s trial calendar ).  But that \nwas the most the court could offer without compromising its ability to meet the early August deadline for issuing a \nremedies decision that it had announced back in September.  Id. at 102:18 –104:1. Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 16 of 1917 (Google’s counsel stating that “trying to get this calendar to work has been like air traffic control \nat National Airport” —“[i]t is very, very difficult”) .  At this late stage , Apple’s request for \nintervention, if granted, would unfairly prejudice the parties  by adding to their already heavy \nburden.6 \nThe alternative, of course, would be to delay the evidentiary hearing, and with it, the \nresolution of this case.  But not even Apple defends  that option, and for obvious reason—it merely  \nswaps one form of prejudice for another.  See supra 14–15;  Apple’s Mem. at 2 (emphasizing that \n“granting intervention would not delay or otherwise disrupt the proceedings ”); Apple’s Reply at \n5 (stating that “Apple agrees with Plaintiffs that the ‘remedies phase must proceed expeditiously’” and recognizing that “delayed resolution of the merits” constitutes “unfair prejudice”  (alteration \nand citations omitted)).   In the context of this case, moreover, s uch prejudice would likely be \nconsiderable.   The court has organized its docket around the remedial proceeding , and it simply \ndoes not have the same flexibility now as it did last September, when it first set the schedule.   \nJan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 101:25–102:2.  Consequently, the delay from postponing the evidentiary \nhearing would be months, not weeks.  Given that this case has already been pending for over four \nyears, s uch a delay would be prejudicial to the parties  and contrary to the public’s keen interest \nin prompt resolution of this matter . \nFinally, the court cannot turn a blind eye to the potential consequences of granting Apple’s \nmotion .  If Apple is  entitled to intervene, “ there is no apparent reason why” other counterparties \nto Google’s search distribution agreements  “could be denied a similar opportunity.”  Deutsche \nBank National Trust Co. v. FDIC , 717 F.3d 189, 192 (D.C. Cir. 2013) ; see Pls.’ Opp’n at 8 ( “In \n \n6 Plaintiffs represented in both their opposition brief and at oral argument that , in the event  Apple is granted \nintervention,  they might  seek to amend their complaints under Rule 15 “to include Apple as a named defendant for \nliability purposes” and “request that Apple be bound by the Court’s final judgment.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 16; accord Jan. 17, \n2025 Tr. at 33.   If that were to come to pass, this litigation would  experience even greater disruption and delay.  Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 17 of 1918 theory, any company that signed Mobile Application Distribution Agreements, Revenue Share \nAgreements, and other similar agreements [  ] could make the same arguments that Apple has \nmade here.”).  Such counterparties include some of the world’s largest companies, like Samsung and AT&T, to name  just two.  Mem. Op. at 101.  They also include browser developer s, like \nMozilla, whose Firefox browser depends on Google ’s revenue share payments for its very \nsurvival.  Id. at 116 (finding that Google’s 2021 revenue share payment to Mozilla amounted to \n“80% of Mozilla’s operating budget”).  Plaintiffs have already been contacted by two third parties who are currently contemplating  intervention.  Jan. 17, 2025 Tr. at 34:4-14. \nApple dismisses this concern as “misguided” in light of Apple’s position under Plaintiffs’  \nPFJ—namely , that Apple is the only entity (besides Google) “ specifically target[ed] by name” in \na provision “ of extraordinary breadth.”   Apple’s Reply at 6 (citing Pls.’ PFJ, ECF No. 1062-1 \n[hereinafter Pls.’ PFJ], § IV.B ).  But as Plaintiffs rightly point out, “Plaintiffs’ PFJ prohibits \nGoogle from paying any  third party . . . for making Google the default search engine on its \ndevices.”  Pls.’ Opp’n at 4 (emphasis added) (citing Pls.’ PFJ, § IV.A).  Thus, Apple’s contractual  \ninterests are not unique .  If this court were to open the door to intervention now, halfway through \nthe remedial phase, there is a strong possibility that this litigation would become even more \ncomplex and prolonged. \nThe court therefore finds that the existing parties would suffer substantial prejudice were \nApple to intervene at this late stage.  \nIII. \nBecause Apple’s Motion for Limited Intervention fails to satisfy Rule 24 ’s timeliness \nrequirement , the motion is hereby denied.  NAACP , 413 U.S. at 365; Associated Builders & \nContractors, Inc. v. Herman, 166 F.3d 1248, 1257 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM     Document 1153     Filed 01/27/25     Page 18 of 1919 \nThe court hereby grants Apple permission to participate as amicus curiae  and file  a post-\nhearing brief  alongside the parties.  If Mr. Cue is called to testify at the evidentiary hearing , Apple \nmay also submit an affidavit from one additional fact witness  that addresses facts not covered by \nMr. Cue’s testimony.  If Mr. Cue is not called to testify, Apple may submit two affidavits from \nfact witnesses , in addition to a post-hearing brief. \nThis is a final, appealable order.  \n \n                                          \nDated:  January 27, 2025     Amit P.

    "summary": "1. Summary: In the case of Charmaine Tate v. VITAS Healthcare Corporation, the court addressed whether the use of conversation intelligence software by VITAS and its provider, Invoca, violated California's privacy laws. The court found that Invoca could be considered a third party since it has the capability to use data collected from VITAS's calls for its own purposes, thereby potentially infringing the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The use of AI and automated systems is central to this case, as Invoca's software records, analyzes, and stores call data without the consent of the callers, which is essential to the plaintiff's claims.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the use of Invoca’s AI-powered conversation intelligence software by VITAS and Invoca itself constitutes a violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act by recording and analyzing phone calls without the consent of all parties, treating Invoca as a third party.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court denied VITAS Healthcare Corporation's motion to dismiss, holding that Invoca is deemed a third party capable of using the data for its purposes, which may trigger liability under section 631(a) of the California Invasion of Privacy Act. Consequently, both Invoca and VITAS might be liable for aiding in the alleged privacy violations.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you call a company to discuss something personal, and without telling you, they use a computer program to listen and keep a record of what you say. In this case, the company and the group that made the computer program both didn't tell the caller about this listening and recording. The court said that this wasn't okay and that the way they use this program might break the law since they can use what you say in ways you didn’t agree to. The court decided the caller has a fair point, so they are letting the lawsuit continue.",

Unknown to the woman \ncalling , the healthcare provider utilized  a software to listen to the contents of the call \nand produce  data about the call’s purpose and resolution.  Via its Terms of Service, \nthe software creator reserved the rights to employ the data yielded from those calls \nfor its own business and product development functions .  Does the woman have a \nviable  claim that the use of that software by the healthcare provider and the software \ndeveloper  violated California privacy laws?   \nIn weighing this question , the Court must determine whether the software \ndeveloper is a third party separate from the healthcare provider, or an extension of \nthe healthcare provider itself.   The Court joins a number of district courts in holding Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 1 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  2  \n \n that the developer  of software used to record and analyze phone calls is a third party \nwhen the developer is able to utilize  data obtained for its own purposes , separate \nfrom the interests of the parties to the call .  The Court finds that the software \ndeveloper in this case is capable of using  the data for its own purposes , and because \nthe use of its software was not disclosed to the caller, it may be in violation of  \nCalifornia privacy laws.   Additionally, because  the healthcare provider aided the \nsoftware developer in obtaining access to the client calls, it may also be held liable.   \nAccordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 12 ) is DENIED.  \nBACKGROUND  \nDefendant VITAS Healthcare Corporation operates hospice and palliative care \nlocations throughout California.  ( ECF No. 10; “ FAC ” ¶ 9.)  It utilizes  a conversation \nintelligence software -as-a-service (“SaaS”) provided by Invoca, Inc. (“Invoca”)  to help \nanalyze the more than 90,000 annual calls it receives to its call centers .  (Id. ¶¶ 1, 36.)  \nWhen a person calls VITAS, Invoca’s software records and creates a transcript of the \ncaller’s speech.  ( Id. ¶ 20.)  Invoca feeds that transcript to an artificial intelligence (AI) \nprogram that identifies patterns and classifies the data  into a searchable database , \nwhich is then sent to VITAS.  ( Id.)  This data base  is used by VITAS to understand what \nquestions and concerns its callers have, so that VITAS  can adjust the content it delivers \nto consumers and the call scripts utilized  by its representatives.  ( Id. ¶ 37.)  Under  its \nTerms of Service, Invoca can also use data obtained for other limited purposes, \nincluding “to optimize and improve Services or otherwise operate Invoca’s business.”  \n(Id. ¶¶ 33, 34.)  Neither VITAS nor Invoca obtain the consent of any caller to VITAS’ s \ncall center , and callers are unaware that their speech is being recorded and analyzed .  \n(Id. ¶¶ 6, 40.) \nIn late 2023, Plaintiff Charmaine Tate called Defendant VITAS and spoke with a \nVITAS representative regarding  hospice care for Tate’s grandmother.  ( Id. ¶¶ 8, 42.)  \nTate alleges that the use of Invoca’s software  to record and analyze her and other s’ \ncalls  to VITAS  violates the California Invasion of Privacy Act ( “CIPA ”) sections  631(a) Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 2 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  3  \n \n (unauthorized wiretapping)  and 632(a)  (unauthorized eavesdropping on or recording \nof confidential communications ), and that VITAS is liable for aiding those  violation s.  \n(Id. ¶ 41 ; see Cal. Pen. Code1 §§ 631(a), 632(a). )  On February 28, 2024, Tate brought \nthis action  in the Sacramento Superior Court  on behalf of herself and members of a \nproposed class , and it was removed to federal court on May 9, 2024 .  The proposed \nclass for which Tate seeks certification would consist of all California residents who \ncalled VITAS’s customer service line while in California and whose conversations with \nVITAS were intercepted and recorded by Invo ca.  (Id. ¶ 49.)   \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nA party may move to dismiss for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can \nbe granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  The motion may be granted only if the complaint \nlacks a “cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal \ntheo ry.”  Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008).  \nWhile the Court assumes all factual allegations are true and construes “them in the \nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party,” Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v. Symington , 51 \nF.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995) , if the complaint's allegations do not “plausibly give \nrise to an entitlement to relief” the motion must be granted, Ashcroft v.

Section 631(a) \noutlines  repercussions for any person:  \n  \n(1) “[W] ho, by means of any machine, instrument, or contrivance, or in any other \nmanner, intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection, whether \nphysically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any \ntelegraph or telephone wire, line , cable, or instrument, including the wire, \nline, cable, or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, \nor who willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, \nor in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to r ead, or to learn the \ncontents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the \nsame is in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or is being sent \nfrom, or received at any place within this state ;” or \n(2) “[W]ho  uses, or attempts to use, in any manner, or for any purpose, or to \ncommunicate in any way, any information so obtained, or who aids, agrees \nwith, employs, or conspires with any person or persons to unlawfully do, or \npermit, or cause to be done any of the acts or things mentioned above in \nthis section .” \n \n \n \nSection 632(a) prohibits a person from:  \n  \n“[I]ntentionally and without the consent of all parties to a confidential \ncommunication, us [ing]  an electronic amplifying or recording device to \neavesdrop upon or record the confidential communication, whether the \ncommunication is carried on among the parties in the presence of one another \nor by means of a telegraph, telephone, or other device, excep t a radio .” \n \nThere are three questions the Court must consider in weighing VITAS’s Motion \nto Dismiss  (hereinafter, “Mot.”).  First, the Court must determine the standard to apply \nto Invoca’s access to VITAS’s caller data , specifically whether Tate must allege that \nInvoca actually  used  the data for its own purposes, or merely that Invoca was capable  \nof doing  so.  Second, the Court must decide whether Invoca’s software is considered a \n“device” under section 632 (a).  Finally, the Court must assess whether a common law Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 4 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  5  \n \n aiding and abetting standard should be read into section 63 1(a).  At present, t here  is \nno Ninth Circuit precedent  on these questions and d istrict courts in this Circuit have \nreached different results .  The Court discusses each issue in turn.  \nI. Whether Invoca must actually use the data it obtains for its own purposes  \nSection 631(a) prohibits third part ies from “read[ing], or attempt[ing] to read, or \nto learn the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication” “without \nthe consent of all parties to the communication.”  § 631(a).   Plaintiff alleges that \nInvoca, via its software, learns  the contents of calls to VITAS without the consent of the \ncaller, therefore violating section 631(a)  as an unauthorized, third -party listener .  (FAC \n¶ 7.)  Defendant counters that because Invoca  provides its data solely to VIT AS, it is \nnot a third party but rather an extension of VITAS itself , and therefore the use of \nInvoca’s software cannot violate section 631(a) .  (Mot.  at 3–6.) \nThere are two seminal California cases that frame how courts consider third \nparties under CIPA : Rogers v. Ulrich , 52 Cal.  App. 3d 894 (1975)  and Ribas v. Clark , 38 \nCal. 3d 355 ( 1985 ).  In Rogers , Ulrich used a tape recorde r attached to his telephone \nto record his phone call with Rogers, and then later played that recording for a third \nparty who was not involved in the call.  Id. at 897 –98.  The California Court of Appeal \nheld that Ulrich’s use of a tape -recording device did not violate section  631(a)’s \nrestriction  on eavesdropping because Ulrich himself was a party to the call , noting that \n“only a third party can listen secretly to a private conversation .”  Id. at 899 ; see Ribas , \n38 Cal.  3d at 360, fn.3 (“Rogers  merely held, correctly, that section 631 does not \npenalize the secret recording of a conversation by one of the participants .”).  In other \nwords, Ulrich’s recording device was seen as a permissible extension of Ulrich himself.  \nBy contrast, in  Ribas , a woman called her husband and had Clark, a third party , \nlisten in live on her phone call as the husband  allegedly  confessed that he had \nprevented his wife from obtaining counsel during the dissolution proceedings of their \nmarriage.  38 Cal. 3d at  358–59.  The California Supreme Court held that Clark’s secret \nmonitoring was prohibited under section 631 (a), noting that this kind of privacy Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 5 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  6  \n \n violation  committed by a third party to the call “denies the speaker an important \naspect of privacy of communication ,” and that the state legislature had sought to curb \nthese sorts of privacy  violation s.  Id. at 361.  \nThe Court is tasked with determining whether Invoca’s software is more similar \nto the permissible tape recorder used in Rogers , or the impermissible third -party  \nlistener in Ribas .  That is  to say , does the software function as a recording made by a \nparty to the call, or is it a separate party entirely ?  Further, t here is a split amongst  \ndistrict courts as to whether a third -party  entity must actually use the data it obtains for \nits own purposes or if it merely needs to have the capability to do so to act as  a third \nparty in violation of  section 63 1(a).   \nOn one side of this split is Graham v. Noom, Inc. , 533 F.  Supp.  3d 8 23 (N.D. Cal. \n2021 ).  See also Yockey v. Salesforce, Inc. , 688 F.  Supp.  3d 962 (N.D . Cal. 2023).  \nGraham  involved a web application called  Noom, which utilized  a software designed \nby FullStory to record what actions visitors took on Noom’s website, including visitors’ \nkeystrokes, mouse clicks, and page scrolling.  Id. at 827.  A visitor to Noom’s website \nsued, alleging that the software’s collection of user interactions with the application \nconstituted privacy violations under section 631(a).  Id. at 828 –29.  The Graham court \nheld that neither company violated section 631(a), reasoning that FullStory merely \ncaptured the user data and hosted that data on its own servers where Noom could \nthen use the data by analyzing it.  Id. at 832 –33.  The court distinguished the case from \nsimilar ones in which the software developer had actually received some sort of \nbenefit from collecting user data itself, such as when those software developers \nthemselves separately sold the user data.  Id.; see Revitch v. New Moosejaw, LLC , 2019 \nWL 5485330  (N.D. Cal. Oct. 23, 2019) .  Noting these differences , the court saw \nFullStory’s software as an  extension of Noom itself because Noom was the party that \nwas responsible for assessing the data received, with the softw are solely working to \ncollect that data for Noom , and Noom alone .  Graham , 533 F.  Supp.  3d at 832–33.

Assurance IQ, LLC , 649 F.  Supp.  3d 891 \n(N.D. Cal. 2023 ).  Javier involved Assurance IQ, LLC’s use of a software developed by \nActiveProspect Inc., which tracked website visitors’ keystrokes, mouse clicks, data \nentry, and other interactions.  Id. at 894.  In weighing the plaintiff’s  section 631(a) \nclaim , the Javier court critiqued Graham ’s reasoning that a third -party software \ndeveloped would need to use the data for its own purposes in order for it to violate \nsection 631(a).  Id. at 900.   The Javier court noted that there is already a use \nrequirement in one of section 631 (a)’s discrete clauses  (“us[ing], or attempt[ing] to \nuse, in any manner, or for any purpose, or to communicate in any way, any information \nso obtained ”), and therefore it would be improper to impute that use requirement to \nall of section 631(a).  Id.  The court in that case also noted that in Ribas , the California \nSupreme Court never considered the wife’s friend’s intentions or her use for the \ninformation obtained , and so to consider a third party’s intent in obtaining data here \nwould similarly  be improper .  Id.; Ribas , 38 Cal.  3d at 360 –61.   \nThe Court finds Javier ’s reasoning to be more  persuasive.  Section 631(a)’s text, \nwhich prohibits a third party from “learn[ing] the contents or meaning of any \nmessage,” does not actually contain a use requirement.  See id. at 899 –900; §  631(a).  \nBut in a separate  section, separated by a semicolon, the statute then prohibits a party \nfrom “us[ing], or attempt[ing] to use” any obtained information.  §  631(a).  The statute \noutlines severa l ways for its restriction to apply and  does not limit its application solely \nto parties that directly use the data they obtain from listening in on a call.   In other \nwords, an  entity can violate the statute by learning  the contents of the message or by \nusing information obtained from listening in on a conversation .  Similar to the \nCalifornia Supreme Court and Javier court, this Court finds it unnecessary  to consider \na third party’s intention to collect  or use  data from a call.  See Ribas , 38 Cal. 3d at 360 –\n61.  Obtaining  that data  while reserving the capability to utilize  it makes a third party \ndistinct from one of the parties to the call and may  trigger a violation of section 631(a).  Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 7 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  8  \n \n This reading of the statute’s plain text is also in line with what  the California \nSupreme Court has made clear : that the state legislature’s “express objective in \nenacting section 631” was to  protect callers from having an outsider “tap [their] \ntelephone or listen  in on the call.”  Ribas , 38 Cal.  3d at 363.   Because Invoca’s software \neffectively “ listen [s] in” on user calls, independently analyzes that data, and  the \ncompany  reserves the capability to then use that data for its o wn purposes, Invoca’s \nsoftwar e may be in violation of  631(a).  \nMoreover, while the Court does not find Graham persuasive, even Graham itself \ndoes not help Defendant here.  While Graham  likewise involved claims of improper \ncollection of data rather than use of that data, critically in Graham  the plaintiffs did not \nallege that FullStory collected the data and could use it for its own purposes.  Rather, \nthey attacked FullStory’s storage of user information on its servers, framing that \nstorage itself as a violation of section 631(a).  Id. at 828, 832 –33.  The district court \nrejected the plaintiff’s argument, noting that “ there are no allegations here that \nFullStory intercepted and used the d ata itself,” and highlighted that FullStory’s \nsoftware simply recorded data that was then analyzed by Noom, rather than FullStory.  \nId. at 832 –33.  But here, Plaintiff does allege that Invoca has the capability to analyze \nthe data itself and further, that Invoca expressly reserves the ability to use that data for \nits own purposes.  (FAC ¶¶ 30 –35.)   \nDefendant’s reliance on Yockey v. Salesforce, Inc., 688 F. Supp. 3d 962  (N.D. \nCal. 2023) to argue that an alleged third party that merely records data for a \nlegitimate party to a call does not violate section 631(a) is similarly unavailing.  ( See \nMot. at 4 –5.)  Yockey involved Rite Aid and Kaiser Permanente’s utilization  of a \nsoftware developed by Salesforce to create transcripts of online chat messages sent \non the companies’ website.  Yockey , 688 F. Supp. 3d at 967 –68.  Interestingly, and to \nDefendant’s de triment, that case specifically recognized that the inquiry into whether \na third -party acts as an extension of a part to the call hinges on “whether the third \nparty ‘ha[s] the capability to use its record of the interaction for any other purpose.’”  Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 8 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  9  \n \n See id . at 972, quoting Javier , 649 F. Supp. 3d at 900 .  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot sufficiently allege that the third party could use any data obtained for its own \npurpose —they were not able to point  to evidence beyond the third party’s possession \nof user data to substantiate their claim .  Id. at 972 –73.  But here, as discussed next , \nPlaintiff does properly allege that Invoca has that capability, namely  Invoca’s express \nreservation of that ability in its Terms of Service .  VITAS’ own case citations support the \nargument that Invoca’s ability to use the data  it collects for its own purposes is itself \nsufficient to establish a violation of section 631(a).  \nVITAS maintains that Invoca’s collection of data is solely for the use of VITAS \nand that Invoca cannot use the data for any other purpose s.  (Mot. at 4–6.)  VITAS \npoints to a “Business Association Agreement,” which it states precludes Invoca from \nutilizing  any data obtained for its own purposes.  (Id. at 6, fn.3. )  VITAS does not attach \na copy of this Agreement as an exhibit nor does it explicitly describe its contents ; and \nin any event the Court is precluded from relying on such factual assertions in resol ving \na motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) .  See Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. \nAgency , 261 F.3d 912, 925 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[E]vidence outside the complaint . . . \nshould not be considered in ruling on a motion to dismiss.”) .  Regardless  of any \nBusiness Association Agreement , Invoca’s  Terms of Service expressly reserve the \nability to use “Client  Data, as reasonably necessary for Invoca to provide and enhance \nits provision of services.”  (FAC ¶ 33. )  Under the se Terms of Service, Invoca may use \nthe data obtained from calls placed to VITAS to improve its own product and services.  \nInvoca’s software has already allegedly violated the caller’s privacy; whether Invoca  \nactually uses the contents of the call for its own purposes  is not legally relevant.  See \nJavier , 649 F.  Supp.  3d at 900.    \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Invoca , via its  software , is a third party, distinct \nfrom both Plaintiff Tate and Defendant VITAS , and that Invoca’s ability to use the data \nobtained for its own purposes may be sufficient to trigger section 631(a) liability.  \n//// Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 9 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  10  \n \n II. Whether Invoca’s software is an “electronic amplyfying or recording \ndevice”  \nFinding that Invoca  is a third party, the Court must then determine whether it is \na recording device under section 632(a).  As relevant here, section 632 (a) prohibits \nthird parties from using  a “recording device to eavesdrop upon or record the \nconfidential communication” of a call , but does not provide a definition of “device.”   \n§ 632(a).  Defendant VITAS asserts that Invoca’s software is not a “device” under CIPA .  \n(Mot. at 7–8.)  District courts have defined “device” differently depending on which \nsection of CIPA a claim arises under.  For example, in In re Google Location History \nLitigation , 428 F.  Supp.  3d 185 , 193 (N.D. Cal. 2019)  (“Google Litigation ”), the court \nanalyzed a software under a different section of CIPA —section 637.7 (d)—and found  that \n“[s]oftware like Google Maps, Chrome, etc. are not ‘devices’ within the meaning of \nCIPA because they are not ‘equipment.’“   But courts have also reached contrary \nresults.  In  Gladstone v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc. , 2024 WL 3276490, *8 (W.D. Wash. \nJuly 2, 2024) , the court turned to the federal Wiretap Act for a definition of “device” \nunder CIPA and found “ that ‘device,’ as used in section 632, can incl ude software.”  \nAfter weighing these two approaches, the Court agrees with Gladstone that section \n632(a)’s  definition of “device” can include  Invoca’s software.  \nFederal courts apply state  rules of statutory construction when interpreting a \nstatute  from that state .  See In re Lares , 188 F.3d  1166,  1168  (9th Cir. 1999) .  The first \nstep in that inquiry is to “scrutinize the actual words of the statute, giving them a plain \nand commonsense meaning.”   Cal. Tchrs.  Assn.  v. Governing  Bd. of Rialto  Unified  Sch.  \nDist. , 14 Cal. 4th 627,  633 (internal  quotations  omitted ).  If no ambiguity exists, the \nplain language of the statute governs.  People  v. Snook , 16 Cal. 4th 1210,  1215  (1997)   \n(“Snook ”). \nDefendant VITAS urges the Court to look to  Google Litigation , 428 F.  Supp.  3d \n185, and Moreno v. S.F. Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. , 2017 WL 6387764 (N.D. Cal. Dec. \n14, 2017) , both of which conclude that  a software is not a device under CIPA.  (Mot. at Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 10 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  11  \n \n 8.)  However,  neither case is  applicable  because they both analyze “devices” under \nsection 637.7 (d), rather than section 632(a).  Google Litigation  involved  a tracking \nsoftware that collected and stored user data.  428 F.  Supp.  3d at 18 7–88.  A user sued \nunder section 637.7, alleging that the software improperly tracked and stored their \nlocation, but the district court dismissed the claim , finding that downloaded software \nis not a device  within the meaning of  section 637(d) .  Id. at 19 3–94.  And in Moreno , \nwhen faced with a similar set of facts, the court  reached the same conclusion, positing  \nthat software is not a “device” under section 637(d) .  2017 WL 6387764  at *5.   \nBut section 637.7(d)’s text explicitly restricts its definition of “electronic tracking  \ndevice” (emphasis added) to that specific section, rather than to other sections such as \n632(a)  which use the more gen eric phrase “electronic device ”.  See § 637.7(d ) (“As \nused in this section, ‘electronic tracking  device’ means . . .”).   And even if its definition \nwere used to inform other sections,  section 637.7  is concerned with electronic \ntracking dev ices that are clearly meant to be physical  and thus is not a proper \nconsideration for defining “device” under section 632(a) .  Specifically , section  637.7 (d) \ndefines an “electronic tracking device ” as one  that can be “attached to a vehicle or \nother movable thing”  which evinces  the statute’s emphasis on proscribing physical \ntracking devices .  See § 637.7(d ).  Section 632(a), however, lacks any language \nsuggesting that a n “electronic amplifying or recording device” must be physical  in \nnature .  Relying on the more specific text of section 637.7(d) to inform section 632(a) is \nmisguided, given section 637.7(d)’s explicit focus on  tangible  devices.   \nGladston e, which considers the definition of “device” under the federal Wiretap \nAct, provides a more helpful framework for deducing what “device” means under  \nsection 632(a ).  2024 WL 3276490.  Courts routinely look to federal law in interpreting \nCIPA, which was modeled off the Wiretap Act.   See Brodsky v. Apple Inc ., 445 F.  Supp.  \n3d 110,  127 (N.D.

The Gladstone court considered two factors —first, that the \nmajority of federal courts nationwide applying the federal Wiretap  Act have landed on \na definition of “device” that includes software.  See United States v. Hutchins , 361 F.  \nSupp.  3d 779, 795 (E.D. Wis. 2019) (collecting cases) ; see also In re Carrier IQ, Inc. , 78 \nF. Supp.  3d 1051, 1087 (“ Software is an ‘[e]lectronic, mechanical, or other device’ \nwhich ‘can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication.’” ).  Second, \nthe court considered the California Supreme Court’s instruction that “ all CIPA \nprovisions are to be interpreted in light of the broad privacy -protecting statutory \npurposes of CIPA.”  Gladstone , 2024 WL 3276490  at * 8, quoting  Javier v. Assurance \nIQ, LLC,  2022 WL 1744107, *2 (9th Cir. May 31, 2022) ; see Ribas , 38 Cal.  3d 355.    \nThese factors together support a reading that software can be a device under \nsection 632(a).   Invoca’s software, while not a physical device, has the  capability to \nrecord  confidential information made in calls  and reproduce those calls and data \nextracted from them for VITAS  or Invoca .  That is to say, even though it is not physical , \nthe software functionally operates in a way that is reasonably envisioned by the \nstatute.   And like in Gladstone , the recording undertaken by the software infringes on \nthe very privacy right that the California Legislature sought to enshrine in CIPA.  See \nRibas,  38 Cal. 3d at 359 (“ In enacting this statute, the Legislature declared in broad \nterms its intent ‘to protect the right of privacy of the people of this state ’ from what it \nperceived as ‘a serious threat to the free exercise of personal liberties [th at] cannot be \ntolerated in a free and civilized society. ’  [Citation.]  This philosophy appears to lie at \nthe heart of virtually all the decisions construing the Privacy Act. ”) \nBecause the software can record conversations and in doing so, violates the \nprivacy of at least one of the callers,  the Court finds that Invoca’s software can be \nconsidered a “device” under section 632(a).   Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 12 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  13  \n \n III. Whether VITAS can be held liable for aiding, agreeing with, employing, or \nconspiring with Invoca  \n Under 631(a), an entity that “uses, or attempt s to use, in any manner, or for any \npurpose, or to communicate in any way, any information so obtained, or who aids, \nagrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons  to unlawfully do, or \npermit, or cause to be done any of the acts or things mentioned above in this section ” \nmay be held liable.   § 631(a) (italics added ).  Defendant VITAS argues  that it lacks the \nrequisite intent under an “aiding and abetting” standard because it did not know that \nInvoca wa s allegedly violating section 631(a) .  (Mot. at 7.) \nThe plain text of section 631(a) is unambiguous on this issue:  the statute \nrequires that a party “aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires” with another party.  \n§ 631(a).   It does not require that a party aid and abet.  See Cousin v. Sharp \nHealthcare , 681 F. Supp. 3d 1117, 1130 (S.D. Cal. 2023) (“ Defendant's contention that \n‘aids’ means ‘aiding and abetting ’ ignores the ‘agrees with, employs, or conspires with ’ \nlanguage of the clause .”).  VITAS’s proposed  “aiding  and abetting” standard goes \nbeyond what the statute requires , and there is no basis to read in a common law \nstandard  of aiding and abetting  when the statute itself is clear .  See Snook , 16 Cal. 4th \nat 1215  (“If there  is no ambiguity  in the language,  we presume  the Legislature  meant  \nwhat  it said and the plain  meaning  of the statute  governs. ”).  Instead, to establish a \nviolation a plaintiff need only prove that a party (VITAS) aided, agreed with, employed, \nor conspired with  a third party (Invoca) as it violat ed section 631(a).  As discussed \nabove, Plaintiff Tate has pled facts that would support a viable claim that Invoca has \nviolated the statute .  Plaintiff’s claims that  VITAS has supported Invoca in doing so  by \nallowing  Invoca access to the calls and has presumably paid Invoca to analyze the data \nthose calls yield  are sufficient to implicate section 631(a ).  Accordingly, the Court finds \nthat VITAS may  be found liable under section 631(a)  for its role in assisting Invoca ’s \nmonitor ing and analy sis of  calls made to VITAS .  \n//// Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 13 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  14  \n \n \nCONCLUSION  \nIn accordance with the above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant’s Motion \nto Dismiss (ECF No. 12) is DENIED.   \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDated:      January 8, 2025      \nHon.

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nThe court case involves a trademark infringement lawsuit filed by Impulse Communications against Uplift Games and others over the use of the \"Adopt Me\" brand for a virtual pet game. Impulse claims that Uplift's use of nearly identical domain names and branding constitutes trademark infringement and unfair competition, while Uplift argues their game is distinct and does not generate confusion. The case highlights that Impulse's brand, initially used for an AI-powered virtual pet game, has expanded into physical toys and rebranded on mobile platforms, while Defendants' version, hosted on Roblox, has become highly popular internationally, causing market confusion. \n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe key legal issue is whether Uplift Games and its co-defendants committed trademark infringement and engaged in unfair competition by using a \"confusingly similar\" brand name and domain names that allegedly caused consumer confusion with Impulse Communications' \"Adopt Me\" trademark.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court denied the motion to dismiss Counts IV and VI, determining that Impulse plausibly alleged violations under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) and Rhode Island common-law unfair competition. The court also evaluated a motion to strike certain paragraphs from the complaint but granted the motion partially, removing some allegations that lacked direct connection or were deemed hyperbolic.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation:\nThink of Impulse Communications as a company that created a popular game about adopting digital pets online—they've been around since the start of the new millennium. Then, along came another company, Uplift Games, doing something very similar but with their own game called \"Adopt Me!\" on a well-known gaming platform, Roblox. Impulse says this is confusing customers and hurting their brand. They took Uplift to court, claiming Uplift was using similar names, causing people to mix up the two games. The court mostly sided with Impulse, saying their complaints were strong enough to keep the case going, but did take out some parts of their complaint that didn't directly relate to the case.",

No. 24-cv-166-JJM-LDA \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER  \nJOHN J. MCCONNELL, JR., United St ates District Court Chief Judge \n In 1998, Plaintiff Impulse Communications, Inc. (“Impulse”) launched its \nwebsite “AdoptMe.com” ( see ECF No. 1 at 4, ¶¶ 11-12), which two years later began \nfeaturing a virtual pet game called “Adopt Me”.  Id. ¶ 12.  In 2017, Defendant Uplift \nGames, LLC (“Uplift”) launched its virtua l pet game “Adopt Me” on the Roblox \nplatform.1  Id. at 11, ¶¶ 50-51.  Impulse has sued Uplift, Treetop Games LLC \n(“Treetop”), and Lionfield Investments Ltd. (“Lionfield”) (collectively “Defendants”) \nfor various trademark infringement claims.  The crux of the Complaint is that Defendants knew or should have known abo ut the popularity of Impulse’s “Adopt Me” \n \n1 “Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by \nRoblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games created by \nthemselves or others.”  Wikipedia, h ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox.

Defendants maintain that the “Adopt Me” consumers did not so \nwidely recognize the brand that it would to be considered famous, and that the \nrequisite bad-faith intent to profit of f their domain names “playadopt.me” and \n“playadoptme.com” was absent.  \nImpulse’s Complaint includes the following counts: \n Count I Trademark Infringement under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a))  \n Count II Dilution of Trademark by Blurring under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c))  \n Count III Dilution of Trademark by Tarnishment under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c) \n Count IV Violation of the Anticybers quatting Consumer Protection Act \nunder 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d) \n Count V Common-Law Trademark Infringement \n Count VI Common-Law Unfair Competition \n Count VII Violation of Trademark Anti -Dilution Statute under R.I.G.L. § 6-\n2-12 \n Count VIII  Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations \n Count IX Tortious Interference with Prospective Business Relations \n Count X Petition for Cancellation of Trademarks  \nBefore the Court is Defendants’3 Motion to Dismiss Counts IV and VI.4 \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA. Impulse’s “Adopt Me” – Inception \nImpulse has been using its “Adopt Me” ma rk continuously since 2000, despite \nnever registering its trademark.  Id. at 5, ¶ 16.  Since then, Impulse has invested \n \n2 iPhone Operating System. \n3 Defendant Lionfield notes in its Motion to Dismiss and Strike that its motion \nis “substantively nearly identical with the present motion.”  ECF No. 22.  Therefore, \nUplift, Treetop, and Lionfield will here inafter be called “Defendants.”   \n4 Plaintiffs have withdrawn Counts II, III, VIII, and IX of its Complaint.  \nDefendants have moved to dismiss Counts IV and VI only.  Therefore, Counts I, V, \nVII and X stand unchallenged at this stage.  Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 2 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 3 approximately $200,000 in the brand.  Id. ¶ 17.  The game is available to players in \nall fifty states, and while the game is fr ee, Impulse generates approximately $1,600 \na month in revenue from third-party advertising.5  Id. ¶¶ 18-19.  In the mid-2000s, \nImpulse expanded its “Adopt Me” brand fr om an online game into the plush toy \nmarket through an agreement with Toys “R” Us.  Id. ¶ 21.  This expansion allowed \nconsumers to buy an “Adopt Me” stuffed animal equipped with a code for the animal’s virtual presence in the “Adopt Me” game.  \nId. at 6, ¶ 22.  Impulse’s “Adopt Me” brand \nhas sought to cultivate a “wholesome, safe , child-and-family-friendly experience.”  Id. \nat 6-7, ¶ 24.  They have tried to do so by prohibiting interaction or communication \namong players.  Id. at 7, ¶ 26.  Since the game was launched, “millions of virtual pets \nhave been adopted,” and there have been about 5,000 visitors a day.  Id. ¶¶ 27-28.  \nDuring this time, “Adopt Me” was the numb er one Google search result under the \nsearch term “virtual pets.”  Id. ¶ 29.  Impulse cites many blog posts and emails from \nusers to support its popularity.  Id. at 7-8, ¶ 32. \nB. Impulse’s “Adopt Me” – Recent Changes \nIn 2020, Impulse converted its website ve rsion to an iOS a pplication and used \nthe existing website domain to instruct user s where to download the new application.  \nId. at 9, ¶ 34.  The next year, it launched an updated version of its website platform, \nwhich had been reprogrammed.  Id. ¶ 35.  A few months later, Impulse issued a press \nrelease announcing six new “Adopt Me” pets and created a theme song music video.  \n \n5 At one point, Impulse generated $5,000 a month from its third-party \nadvertisements.  Id. at 7, ¶ 30.  Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 3 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 4 Id. ¶¶ 36-37.  An internal blockchain6 was also added to the website to keep track of \nall transactions.  Id. at 10, ¶ 39.  Later that year, Impulse added a metaverse auction \nroom to the website, enabling users to bid on the virtual pets.  Id. ¶ 41.   Impulse \neventually partnered with RescueGroups.org to allow users to adopt virtual versions \nof real pets in animal shelters.  Id. ¶ 42.  In 2023, the website was redesigned for a \nsecond time, with a focus on AI-powered virtual pets.  Id. at 11, ¶ 46.   \nC. Defendants’ “Adopt Me!”  \nUplift first launched its virtual game “A dopt Me” on the Roblox online gaming \nplatform in 2017.  Id. ¶¶ 50-51.  Although Uplift’s game was originally for virtual \nhumans, it changed to virtual pets in 2019.  Id. at 12, ¶ 57.  After launching, Uplift \nregistered the “play.adoptme” domain for its game.  Id. at 11, ¶ 53.  The next year, \nUplift added an exclamation point to its brand “Adopt Me!” presumably to \ndifferentiate it from Impulse’s application.  Id. at 13, ¶ 61.  After doing so, Uplift’s \ngame soared in popularity on Roblox attracting billions of visitors each year.  Id. at \n12, ¶ 58.   Despite the addition of th e exclamation point, Defendants’ website \ncontinued to omit the exclamation point.  Id. at 13, ¶ 62.  Defendants’ employees \nregularly omitted the exclamation point when referring to their own game in emails and news releases.\n7  Id. ¶ 63.  Defendants have recent ly expanded their brand into \nthe toy markets at Target, Walmart, and Amaz on by offering plush “Adopt Me!” pets.  \n \n6 A blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions. \n7 Impulse includes an email correspond ence from Uplift employee Josh Ling \nthat reads: “. . . I work on Adopt Me, the Roblox game.”  ECF No. 1 at 13, ¶ 63; the \nPlaintiff also cites to several news rele ases where the exclamation point has been \nomitted.  Id. ¶ 64.

They have also licensed “A dopt Me!” to Hasbro’s NERF division and \nMcDonald’s Happy Meals.  Id. ¶ 68.  “Adopt Me!” is now available on an iOS \napplication as well.  Id. ¶ 69. \nD. Recent Actions \nIn 2020, Uplift contacted Impulse about purchasing the “AdoptMe.com” \ndomain, though Impulse had not listed it for sale.  Id. at 15-16, ¶¶ 77, 81.  Even so, \nImpulse entered negotiations with Uplift.  Id. at 16, ¶¶ 82-83.  During this \nnegotiation period, Impulse paid $100/month to keep the website active and updated \nit to include a public notice that the webs ite was no longer available and provided a \nnew website URL to which visitors could go.8  Id. at 16, ¶¶ 84, 87; see id. at 19, ¶ 106.    \nIn August of that year, the negotiations ended without resolution, and Impulse went \nahead with existing investment plans, which included creation of an iOS application.  \nId. at 16, ¶¶ 85-86.  Impulse also sent notice to Defendants of its intent to continue \nusing the “Adopt Me” mark in commerce, through an iOS app.  Id. at 16-17, ¶ 88.   \nDespite this notice of intent, Uplift a pplied for a federally registered trademark \nof “Adopt Me!” for use first in download able games software in 2021 and then for \nphysical items, such  as toys in 2022.  Id. at 17, ¶¶ 91-92.  Impuls e alleges that Uplift \nused Treetop and Lionfield to hold ownershi p of the trademark to insulate it from \nliability.  Id. ¶ 93.  Impulse alleges that befo re filing their federal trademark \napplications, Defendants had an obligation to reasonably investigate that the use of \n \n8 In its public notice, Impulse instructed  users to visit its affiliated artificial \nintelligence sites: “BoredHumans.com” while the game was down.  Id. at 16, ¶ 88.   Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 5 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 6 “Adopt Me!” did not infringe on anyone else’s rights.  Id. at 21, ¶ 117.  Impulse also \nalleges that the misdirected communication s from users of “Ado pt Me!” that it \nreceived sheds light on the consumer conf usion, which supplies support for trademark \ninfringement.  Id. at 22, ¶ 125.  Impulse has receiv ed many complaints from users of \nDefendants’ game who feel they have been defrauded ( id.  at 22-23, ¶ 126); the usual \n600 visitors a day that Impulse was used to increase to 15,000  id. at 22 ,¶ 125); \nmembers of the public have posted videos and posts confusing the two marks on public \nplatforms such as YouTube ( id. at 23, ¶ 127); users of “A dopt Me” include disclaimers \nin their posts to clarify to which mark they are referring ( id. at 23-24, ¶ 128); Impulse \nwas improperly named as a defendant in multiple lawsuits ( id. at 28, ¶ 143); and \n“AdoptMe.com” is no longer the first search result.  Id. at 24, ¶ 129.  This confusion \nhas also led users to associate the bad behavior9 on “Adopt Me!” with Impulse’s game, \nwhich has damaged its reputation.  Id. at 27-28, ¶ 142.   \nAs a result, Impulse filed this ten-count Complaint against Defendants.  ECF \nNo. 1.  Defendants move to dismiss Count IV and VI.  See ECF No. 14.  In its \nopposition to Defendants’ motion, Impuls e voluntarily withdraws its claims for \nCounts II, III, VIII, and IX.  Defendants al so move to strike paragraphs ¶¶ 131, 137-\n141, 143, 146, 151-153, and a portion of ¶ 201 from the Complaint.  See id.      \n  \n \n9 Impulse alleges that Defendants’ “Ado pt Me!” game was “illegally facilitating \ngambling by selling ‘loot boxes’ in [other countries], and the game was temporarily \nshut down in those countries.”  Id. at 26, ¶ 137.

Motion to Dismiss \nTo survive a motion to dismiss for failu re to state a claim under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (“Rule 12(b)(6)”),  a plaintiff must present facts that make \nher claim plausible on its face.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  \nTo determine plausibility, the Court must first review the complaint and separate \nconclusory legal allegations from allegations of fact.  See Rodriguez-Reyes v. Molina-\nRodriguez , 711 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2013) (citat ion omitted).  Next, the Court must \nconsider whether the remaining factual allegations give rise to a plausible claim of relief.  \nSee id. (citations omitted). \nTo state a plausible claim, a complaint need not detail factual allegations, but \nmust recite facts sufficient at least to “raise a right to relief above the speculative \nlevel.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted).  A pleading that offers “labels and \nconclusions” or “a formulaic recitation of  the elements of a cause of action” cannot \nsuffice.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (inter nal quotation marks omitted) \n(quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555).  “Nor does a co mplaint suffice if it tenders naked \nassertion[s] devoid of furt her factual enhancement.”  Id. (alteration in original) \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 557); see also Soto-\nTorres v. Fraticelli , 654 F.3d 153, 159 (1st Cir. 2 011) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (citation omitted) (“[C]ombined allegations, taken as true, must state a \nplausible, not a merely conceivable, case for relief.”).   Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 7 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 8 B. Motion to Strike \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) provides that th e Court may strike fr om a pleading “any \nredundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.” Paragraphs that are \n“irrelevant to plaintiff’s case” or crowd a complaint with “superfluous” matter can and \nshould be stricken.  See Sheffield v. City of Boston , 319 F.R.D. 52, 55-56 (D. Mass \n2016).  Although courts possess “broad discretion to strike comments that are not ‘substantive elements of the cause of ac tion,’” courts exercise such discretion \njudiciously, exercising such discreti on only in limited circumstances.  \nId. at 54. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Whether Count IV Plausibly Alleges Violation of the Anticybersquatting \nConsumer Protection Act (“ACPA”) \nCount IV alleges that Defendants vi olated the ACPA by registering the \n“playadopt.me” and “playadoptme.com” domain s and having a bad-faith intent to \nprofit from Impulse’s “Adopt Me” trademark.  ECF No. 1 at 36, ¶ 203.  Defendants \ncounter that Impulse has not alleged the requisite bad-faith intent to profit from the domains.  ECF No. 14 at 1.  \nThe ACPA provides that a person shall be liable in a civil action if: \n(1) [t]he person has a bad-faith intent to  profit off the mark, including a \npersonal name which is protected as  a mark under this section; and  \n(2) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that: \ni. in the case of a mark th at is distinctive at the time of registration of \nthe domain name, is identical or confusingly similar to that mark \nii. in the case of a famous mark that is  famous at the time of registration \nof the domain name, is identical or confusingly similar to or dilutive of that mark . . .  \n15 U.S.C. § 125(d)(1)(A).  Some relevant fact ors to consider in deciding whether there \nwas bad faith include:  Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 8 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 9 (II) the person’s intent to divert consumers from the mark owner’s online \nlocation to a site accessible under the domain name that could harm the \ngoodwill represented by the mark, eith er for commercial ga in or with the \nintent to tarnish or disparage th e mark, by creating a likelihood of \nconfusion as to the source, sponsors hip, affiliation, or endorsement of \nthe site; *** (IX) the ex tent to which the mark incorporated in the \nperson’s domain name registration is or is not distinctive and famous \nwithin the meaning of subsection (c).  \n15 USC § 125(d)(1)(B)(i)(II); 15 USC § 125(d)(1)(B)(i)(IX).   \n Here, Impulse alleges that “[its] [mark] is inherently distinctive or has \nacquired distinctiveness through repeated use in commerce.”  ECF No. 1 at 34, ¶ 192.  It also alleges that its “Adopt Me” mark is “famous and widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States.”  \nId. ¶ 193.  The fact that “millions of \nvirtual pets have been adopted,” and that “there have been about 5,000 visitors a day” \nto the website tends to suggest that its “Ado pt Me” brand is at a minimum distinctive.  \nId. at 7, ¶¶ 27-28.  Impulse “has been us ing the mark continuously since 2000” and \nexpanded the “Adopt Me” brand into the toy market through an agreement with Toys \n“R” Us in the mid-2000s. Id. at 5, ¶¶ 16, 21.  Thus, Impu lse has plausibly alleged that, \nat the time Defendants registered their trademark in 2020, its “Adopt Me” mark was \ndistinctive or famous. \nThe fact that Defendants simply added a period and the term “play” to what is \notherwise Impulse’s mark ( id.  at 35, ¶¶ 198-199); that Defe ndants’ domain is also for \na virtual pet game ( id. at 12, ¶ 57); and that Impu lse received “misdirected \ncommunications from users” ( id. at 22, ¶ 125) support the conclusion that it is \nplausible that Defendants registered or used a domain name that is “identical or confusingly similar to [Impulse’s] mark” or  “identical or confusingly similar or Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 9 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 10dilutive of [Impulse’s] ma rk.”  15 U.S.C. § 125(d )(1)(A)(2)(i); 15 U.S.C. \n§ 125(d)(1)(A)(2)(ii).   \nIn support of Defendants’ bad-faith inte nt to profit, Impulse alleges that \nDefendants were aware of the “AdoptMe.co m” domain, as its mark had been around \nfor seventeen years before registration of the trademark (ECF No. 1 at 36, ¶¶ 206, \n209), but continued to register or licen se “playadopt.me” and “playadoptme.com” \ndomains.  Id. at 37, ¶ 211.  Defendants never re quested or received authorization \nfrom Impulse to use its mark.  Id. at 12, ¶ 55.  Like Impulse, Defendants also \nexpanded their brand into the plush toy market.  Id. at 14, ¶ 67.  De fendants’ site had \nbillions of visits each year ( id.  at 12, ¶ 58), and they created an iOS application for \nthe game, presumably a pr ofitable venture.  Id. at 14, ¶69.  Impulse also alleges that \nits brand was damaged by the public conf usion between the marks with Defendants’ \n“implicating ‘Adopt Me’ with bad behavior.”  Id. at 25, ¶ 131.  It is plausible that \nDefendants intended to “divert consumers fr om Impulse’s website to a site accessible \nunder the domain name[s] (i.e., “playado pt.me” “playadoptme.com”) that could harm \nthe goodwill represented by the mark.”  15 U.S.C. § 125(d )(1)(B)(i)(II).   \nThus, the Court finds that Impulse has pr operly pled a claim for relief in Count \nIV under the ACPA.  The Court DENIES Defe ndants’ Motion to Dismiss Count IV.   \nB. Whether Count VI Plausibly Alleges a Common-Law Claim for Unfair \nCompetition \nCount VI alleges that Defendants engaged in unfair competition by using \nImpulse’s “Adopt Me” mark in its own “Ado pt Me!” mark “in a manner likely to cause \nconfusion or mistake as to the affiliation  of Defendants with [Impulse]” that has Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 10 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 11caused Impulse harm.  Id. at 39, ¶¶ 228-229.  Defendants  counter that Impulse has \nfailed to show that “the cons uming public widely identifies  [Impulse] as the source of \nany particular goods and services bearing the [“Adopt Me”] trademark” (ECF No. 14 at 2), and that Defendants have “diverted  business from [Impulse].”  ECF No. 14-1 \nat 19.   \n  Under Rhode Island law, a distinctive trade name is one that “is distinctive \nof a person's business or othe r enterprise and that is used in a manner that identifies \nthat business or enterprise and distinguishe s it from the businesses or enterprises of \nothers.”  Restatement (Third) \nUnfair Competition  § 12 (1995).  A trade name may \n“acquire a distinctiveness as a ‘secondary meaning’ if prospective purchasers have \ncome to identify the busine ss with the trade name.”  Id. at § 13.  \nUnfair competition occurs when “the device or means employed would be likely \nto confuse and mislead the public generally  to purchase the product or patronize the \nshop of one person when the actual intent ion was to purchase the product or patronize \nthe shop of another.”  Nat’l Lumber & Bldg. Materials Co. v. Langevin , 798 A.2d 429, \n433 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Merlino v. Schmetz , 20 A.2d 266, 267 (R.I. 1941) (finding that \nthe plaintiff’s trade name acquired seco ndary meaning where it had been used \ncontinuously since 1957, appeared on publ ic documents, and customers had confused \nthe two entities)).   \nHere, it is plausible that Defendants’ act of registering its domains and iOS \napplication, which were nearly identical wi th Impulse’s, were likely to “confuse and \nmislead the public generally” to buy plush toys from Defendants when their actual Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 11 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 12intention was to purchase the plush toy from  Impulse’s brand.  Impulse alleges that \nits “Adopt Me” brand has been around since 1998 and got a distinctiveness through its secondary meaning evidenced by its conti nued use (ECF No. 1 at  4, ¶¶ 11-12); that \nit expanded into the toy market in the mid-2000s at a we ll-known toy store (\nid.  at 6, \n¶ 22); that Defendants only recently expand ed into the toy market for similar plush \ntoys ( id.  at 14, ¶ 67); and that there is evidence of user confusion ( id.  at 22, ¶ 125) \n(i.e., YouTube videos about confusion as to domain.  See id .  at 23-24, ¶¶ 127-28). \nThus, Impulse has properly pled a common-law claim for unfair competition \nunder Rhode Island law.10  The Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  \nC. Whether the Following Allegations Sh ould be Stricken for “Immaterial, \nImpertinent, or Scandalous Matter”  Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) \n \nDefendants move to strike paragr aphs ¶¶ 131, 137-141, 143, 146, 151-153, and \na part of ¶ 201 from the Complaint.  See ECF No. 14 at 1.  They assert that \n“immaterial and scandalous” allegations were made “in an effort to unfairly impute allegations against Roblox to Defendants, inflame the reader, and disparage the \nreputation of Defendants and their [“Ado pt Me!”] game.”  ECF No. 14-1 at 9.  \nA. Paragraphs 131, 137, 138 \nParagraph 131 alleges that the public  confusion between “Adopt Me” and \n“Adopt Me!” has the effect of implicating “Adopt Me” with bad behavior such as: \nscamming, pedophilia, sex, gambling, and illegal child labor.  ECF No. 1 at 25, ¶ 131.  Defendants assert that these accusations “r elate to alleged activities of third-party \n \n10 But this conclusion as to plausibilit y does not foreclose the possibility that \nImpulse’s trade name is inherently distinctive.   Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 12 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 13criminals and third-party businesses.”  EC F No. 14-1 at 11.  Paragraph 137 alleges \nthat a Google search of the term “adopt me pedophile” returned results implicating \nDefendants’ “Adopt Me!” game.  ECF No. 1 at  26, ¶ 137.  Defendants assert that the \nreference to use of “Roblox currency” (known as “Robux”) in one of them is unfounded \nbecause they do not sell it (ECF No. 14-1 at 9), and that the mention of Snapchat and \nDiscord, which are third-party forums, do not provide a basis for holding Defendants \nliable.  Id.  Paragraph 138 alleges that a Google search of the term  “adopt me rape” \nreturned results implicating the Roblox  platform with child predators.  Id. at 26, \n¶ 138.  Defendants counter that the allega tions in paragraph 138 fail to mention any \nconnection to their “Adopt Me!” game.  ECF No . 14-1 at 10.  They assert that Impulse \ncited no articles or links to show this connection.  Id.  They also argue that the \n“independent hosting platform Roblox” is not “synonymous with or attributable to \nDefendants’ actions.”  Id.   \nAlthough the allegations implicate third-party forums, that does not negate \ntheir materiality.  The Complaint nonetheless alleges a factual connection to the “Adopt Me!” platform, which is suffi cient for the pleading stage.  \nSee ECF No. 1 at 26, \n¶¶ 137-38.  Because of the sp ecific references to “Adopt Me!.” the allegations of \nparagraphs 131, 137, and 138 are material and pertinent to Impulse’s showing of the \nconsequences of consumer confusion and th e damages it has suffered as a result.  \nTherefore, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Strike ¶¶ 131, 137, 138.   \n  Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 13 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 14D. Paragraphs 139, 140 \nParagraph 139 alleges that “there are dozens of articles and forum postings \nabout objectionable activity on the Roblox platform generally.”  Id. ¶ 139.  Defendants \ncounter that the articles cited by Impulse do not reference “Adopt Me!” anywhere and \nthat they have not been named in any laws uits related to these allegations.  ECF \nNo. 14-1 at 11.  Paragraph 140 alleges that “Roblox has been the subject of multiple \nlawsuits” and cites various articles to suppor t.   ECF No. 1 at 27,  ¶ 140.  Defendants \ncounter similarly that there is no connectio n or reference to “Def endants’ business,” \nas they have not been named in an y lawsuits.  ECF No. 14-1 at 11.  \nHere, Defendants are correct that the alle gation in ¶ 139 is void of any mention \nor connection to their “Adopt Me!” brand – th e focus of this lawsuit.  Because Roblox \nis not a party and “Adopt Me!” is not mentioned, the allegations of bad behavior are \nimmaterial to this Complaint.  Similarly, th e allegations in ¶ 140 are immaterial as \nthey do not mention Defendants or “Adopt Me !” at all.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS \nDefendants’ Motion to Strike ¶¶ 139-140.   \nE. Paragraph 141 \nParagraph 141 alleges that most of the articles and postings involving bad \nbehavior on the Roblox platform “cite ‘Ado pt Me’ as an example of a popular game on \nRoblox, even if not explicitly implicating Defendants’ [“Adopt Me!”] game.  ECF No. 1 \nat 27, ¶ 141.  Defendants argue that the a llegations were meant to “unfairly impute \nallegations against Roblox against Defendan ts and their [“Adopt Me!”] game.”  ECF \nNo. 14-1 at 9.   Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 14 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 15Because of Impulse’s admission that Defendants were cited even if not \nexplicitly involved, the allegations in ¶ 1 41 do not connect to “Adopt Me!” and are \nthus immaterial.  The Court GRANTS De fendants’ Motion to Strike ¶ 141.   \nF. Paragraph 143 \nParagraph 143 alleges Impulse’s concern over potential legal exposure due to \nconsumer confusion.  It me ntions “two instances in which [Impulse] became involved \nin lawsuits when litigants mistakenly ei ther named [Impulse] as a defendant or \nserved [Impulse] with a subpoena.”  ECF No. 1 at 28, ¶ 143.  Defendants do not \nprovide a basis to strike ¶ 143 in their Memorandum of Law Supporting their Motion \nto Strike.  See ECF No. 14-1.   \nUnlike some of the other paragraphs, ¶ 143 does not mention any third-party \nforums.  Instead, the allegations focus on  the consumer confusion as evidenced by \nImpulse being improperly named as a party.  This allegation is material to Impulse’s \ngeneral claim of consumer confusion.  The Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to \nStrike ¶ 143.   \nG. Paragraph 146 \nParagraph 146 alleges that because of Defendants’ trademark violations, the \nnegative associations with Impulse’s brand have “grown from being related to run-of-\nthe-mill scams to more severe  issues such as pedophilia , rape, pornography, music \ncopyright violations, underage gambling, and child labor.”  ECF No. 1 at 28, ¶ 146.  \nDefendants argue that the severe issues mentioned do not implicate “Adopt Me!” in \nany way and simply implicate Roblox.   Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 15 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 16While Impulse has successfully pled mate rial facts showing how bad behavior \nsuch as pedophilia and rape has been associ ated with Defendants’ “Adopt Me!” brand, \nit has failed to show how the other “severe issues” are associated.  As a result, ¶ 146 \nis immaterial when taken in its entirety.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS Defendants’ \nMotion to Strike ¶ 146.   \nH. Paragraphs 151-153 \nParagraph 151 alleges that because of the criminal acts that have become \nassociated with Defendants and the Robl ox platform, “potential criminal actions \nagainst Defendants are now possible, and as  a result of the confusion . . . criminal \nactions against [Impulse] [are  possible].”  ECF No. 1 at  29, ¶ 151.  Paragraph 152 \nalleges that because of the criminal acts as sociated with Defendants, “especially those \ninvolving children, also now create the risk that victims . . . could seek revenge and \nseek to injure or kill those they believe to be associated with the [“Adopt Me!’] game.”  \nId.  ¶ 152.  Paragraph 153 alleges that Defe ndants’ trademark violations “carry the \nrisk of personal harm to and wrongful imprisonment of [Impulse’s] owner.”  Id. at 29-\n30, ¶ 153.  Defendants counter that these allegations are “hyperbolic” ( see ECF \nNo. 14-1 at 12) and argues that the “extrapo lation to hypothetical arrests, injuries, \nand even murder are unwarranted.”  Id.   \nWhile Impulse may very well be fearful, that fear alone absent any allegations \nimplicating criminal acts against Defendants is not sufficient for it to allege potential criminal acts against Impulse, by consumer confusion.  Defendants are correct that \nthese allegations are “hyperbolic,” as nowhere in the Complaint are there any Case 1:24-cv-00166-JJM-LDA     Document 29     Filed 12/23/24     Page 16 of 18 PageID #:\n<pageID> \n 17allegations of criminal actions against Defe ndants themselves.  To allege fear of \nhypothetical criminal acts such as murder is  immaterial to the facts of the Complaint.  \nTherefore, the Court GRANTS Defendan ts’ Motion to Strike ¶ 151-153.   \nI. Portion of Paragraph 201 \nParagraph 201 alleges that the confusio n caused by Defendants’ domains has \n“harmed the good will that [Impulse] has cu ltivated for its [“Adopt Me”] mark and \n[website], because [“Adopt Me!”] . . . is associated with bad behavior such as \nscamming, pedophilia, gambling, and th e like.”  ECF No. 1 at 35-36, ¶ 201.  \nDefendants take issue with the second part of the allegation (i.e., bad behavior).  See \nECF No. 14-1 at 13.  They argue that Impulse cites “morally reprehensible and \nscandalous conduct related to third-party la wsuits” and thus it should be stricken.  \nId.   \nBecause Impulse has alleged instances of rape and pedophilia being associated \nspecifically with Defendants’ “Adopt Me!” earlier in the Complaint ( see id.  at 26, \n¶¶ 137-138), the consequences of consumer confusion show n in this allegation are \nmaterial.  Therefore, the Court DENIES De fendants’ Motion to Strike a portion of \n¶ 201.   IV. CONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court DENIES Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss Counts \nIV and VI.  The Court DENIES Defendants’ Mo tion to Strike ¶¶ 131, 137, 138, 143, \nand a part of ¶ 201.  The Court GRANTS De fendants’ Motion to Strike ¶¶ 139, 140, \n141, 146, and 151-153.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied Bumble, Inc.'s motion to dismiss a class action lawsuit, which accused it of violating Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The plaintiff, Dario Dzananovic, claimed that Bumble's dating app used facial recognition technology to collect biometric data without user consent through its photo verification feature. The court found that Bumble's significant marketing activities and revenue generation in Illinois established personal jurisdiction, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois has personal jurisdiction over Bumble, Inc. and related entities for alleged violations of Illinois's Biometric Information Privacy Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it has specific personal jurisdiction over Bumble and its associated entities because they purposefully targeted and exploited the Illinois market through extensive marketing and the operation of their dating app, thereby allegedly violating the Biometric Information Privacy Act in the state of Illinois.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Bumble is like a big store online that people in Illinois visit a lot. The store is accused of secretly taking photos of people’s faces to store them, without asking if it’s okay. Somebody from Illinois said that's not right and wants the store to be accountable. The court decided it can indeed handle this case because the store does a lot of business in Illinois and what it’s accused of doing happened because people in Illinois used its services.",

Wood   BUMBLE, INC., et al.,     )   \n ) \nDefendants. ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nPlaintiff Dario Dzananovic, an Illinois resi dent, has brought this putative class action \nagainst Defendants Bumble, Inc., Buzz Holdings L.P. (“Buzz Holdings” or “Bumble Holdings”), \nand Bumble Trading LLC (“Bumble Trading”) (co llectively, “Defendants”), claiming that they \nviolated Illinois’s Biometric Informa tion Privacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 ILCS 14/1 et seq.  \nSpecifically, Dzananovic alleges th at Defendants used their faci al recognition technology to \ncollect his biometric in formation while he used the photo verification feature on the Bumble \nonline dating application (“Bumb le App” or “App”). Now befo re the Court is Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss the complaint fo r lack of personal jurisdicti on pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(2). (Dkt . No. 29.) For the following reasons, Defendants’ motion is \ndenied. \nBACKGROUND \nWhen considering a motion to dismiss for l ack of personal jurisdiction, any well-pleaded \nfacts alleged in the complaint are taken as true an d any factual disputes in affidavits are resolved \nin the plaintiff’s favor. Tamburo v. Dworkin , 601 F.3d 693, 700 (7th Cir. 2010). The facts recited \nhere are taken from Dzananovic’s Amended Comp laint (“Complaint”). The Court will address Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 1 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n2 \n the affidavits and other evidence the parties a ttached to their briefs, as appropriate, when \ndiscussing the parties’ arguments below. See Purdue Rsch. Found. v. Sanofi-Sunthelabo, S.A. , \n338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. 2003). \nAs alleged, the Bumble App is a popular  dating platform—with approximately 100 \nmillion registered users globall y—on which women initiate cont act with prospective dating \npartners. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3–5, Dkt. No. 21.) The App functions usi ng “a freemium model,” \nwhere certain services are free, but users must pa y for subscriptions or in-app purchases to access \npremium features. ( Id. ¶ 16.) In the third quarter of 2021, for example, the Bumble App \ngenerated $142.5 million in reve nue from premium services. ( Id.) Bumble, Inc. is an American \nsocial media company that form erly operated the Bumble App; it is now a holding company with \na controlling equity interest in Buzz Holdings. ( Id. ¶¶ 10–11.) Bumble, In c. manages Buzz \nHoldings’s business and affairs and c ontrols Bumble Trad ing’s operations. ( Id. ¶¶ 12, 19.) While \nBumble Holdings operates the Bumble App, Bumble  Trading runs the marketing and advertising \nof the Bumble App in the United States and controls personal information collected and \nprocessed through the App. ( Id. ¶¶ 19, 22, 24.) Bumble, Inc.’s ma in source of revenue from the \nApp consists of users’ subscr iptions and in-app purchases. ( Id. ¶ 12.) For instance, in the third \nquarter of 2021, the Bumble App had 1.5 million paying users, leading to $30.99 in average revenue per paying user. ( Id. ¶ 34.) Defendants generate revenue  from thousands of paying users \nin Illinois. ( Id.) \nDzananovic is an Illinois re sident who has used the Bu mble App since March 2021. ( Id. \n¶ 9.) To use the Bumble App, users must prov ide personal identifying information (“PII”), \nincluding date of birth, location, gender identity, and sexual pref erence; Bumble then collects, \nretains, and uses the data for targeted marketing practices. ( Id. ¶¶ 71–72.) Additionally, Bumble Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n3 \n has machine learning capabilities , allowing it to analyze users’  behavioral information to \npersonalize potential matches show n to users and to target user s who are more apt to become \npaid members. ( Id. ¶¶ 83–84.) Further, the App has an optio nal photo verification feature to help \nprotect users from fake accounts. ( Id. ¶¶ 74–75.) Defendants promot e the photo verification \nfeature as a way for users to “flirt, connect, and network comf ortably, knowing the person you’re \ntalking to is exactly w ho they say they are.” ( Id. ¶ 36.) To verify an account, a user uploads a \nphotograph mimicking a pose that the App provides, and the A pp subsequently reviews the \nphoto and confirms or rejects the requested verification. ( Id. ¶ 75.) In particular, the App uses an \nartificial intelligence to ol to conduct a facial scan of the photo, extract geomet ric data from it, \nand then create a facial template. ( Id. ¶ 76.) \nBIPA regulates private entities’ “collec tion, use, safeguarding, handling, storage, \nretention, and destruction of biometric identifiers and in formation.” 740 ILCS 14/5(g). \nAccording to Dzananovic, Defendants violated BI PA by failing to inform him and other Illinois \nresidents that they were collec ting, storing, and using their biomet ric information and identifiers \nwhen they used the Bumble App. As a result, Dzananovic has sued Defendants on behalf of \nhimself and a class of similarly situated Illinoi s residents who “had their biometric information \nand/or biometric identifiers collected, captured, received, or otherwise obtained, or disclosed by \nDefendants while residing in Illinois.” ( Id. ¶ 113.) \nDISCUSSION \n Defendants argue that the Comp laint must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(2) because the \nCourt lacks personal ju risdiction over them.  \nWhen a defendant moves for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2), “the pl aintiff bears the \nburden of demonstrating th at jurisdiction exists.” In re Sheehan , 48 F.4th 513, 520 (7th Cir. \n2022) (citation omitted). If the Court holds an ev identiary hearing, the pl aintiff must establish Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n4 \n personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evid ence; but when the Courts rules on a motion \nto dismiss without an evidentiary heari ng, the plaintiff need  only establish a prima facie  case of \npersonal jurisdiction. NBA Props., Inc. v. HANWJH , 46 F.4th 614, 620 (7th Cir. 2022). The \nCourt may consider affidavits and jurisdictional discovery to decide whether the plaintiff has \nmade a prima facie  case. Purdue Rsch. Found. , 338 F.3d at 782–83. In addition, the Court \naccepts as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint and resolves a ll factual disputes in \nthe record in the plaintiff’s favor. Felland v. Clifton , 682 F.3d 665, 672 (7th Cir. 2012). \nHowever, when the defendant “s ubmit[s] evidence opposing the di strict court’s exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction, the plaintif f[ ] must similarly submit affi rmative evidence supporting the \ncourt’s exercise of jurisdiction.” Matlin v. Spin Master Corp. , 921 F.3d 701, 705 (7th Cir. 2019). \nAnd the Court accepts as true any unrefuted facts in the defe ndant’s supporting materials. GCIU-\nEmp. Ret. Fund v. Goldfarb Corp. , 565 F.3d 1018, 1020 n.1 (7th Cir. 2009). \nGenerally, personal jurisdiction is gove rned by the law of the forum state. Tamburo , 601 \nF.3d at 700; Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1).  Illinois’s long-arm statute aut horizes the exercise of personal \njurisdiction to the full extent of the state and fede ral constitutions. See 735 ILCS 5/2-209(c). \nConsequently, “the state statutory and federal constitutional inquiries merge.” Tamburo , 601 \nF.3d at 700 (citation omitted). The key question “is whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nover the defendants ‘comports with the l imits imposed by federal due process.’” Curry v. \nRevolution Lab’ys, LLC , 949 F.3d 385, 393 (7th Cir. 2020) (quoting Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. \n277, 283 (2014)). \nThe Court can exercise either general or sp ecific personal jurisdic tion over a defendant.  \nSheehan , 48 F.4th at 522. In this case, Dzananovic does not contend that the Court has general \njurisdiction over these Defendants,  so the Court limits its pres ent inquiry to whether it has Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n5 \n specific jurisdiction. For the Court to exercise sp ecific personal jurisd iction: (1) “defendants \nmust have purposefully directed their activi ties at the forum state or purposefully availed \nthemselves of the privilege of conducting business in the forum;” (2) “the alleged injury must \narise out of or relate to the defendants’ forum-related activi ties;” and (3) “any exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction must comport with traditional notions of fair play an d substantial justice.” \nId. (citations omitted). \nI. Purposeful Direction or Purposeful Availment The Court first considers whether Defendants purposefully directed  their activities at \nIllinois or purposefully availed th emselves of the privilege of c onducting business in Illinois. The \nCourt addresses each Defendant separately. See Purdue Rsch. Found. , 338 F.3d at 784 (“[E]ach \ndefendant’s contacts with the forum St ate must be assess ed individually.”). \nA. Bumble Trading \nAs to Bumble Trading, Defendants argue that  its alleged operati on of the Bumble App \nand Illinois residents’ unilater al use of the Bumble App does not constitute Bumble Trading \nexpressly aiming or purposefully  directing its conduct toward Il linois. Specifically, Defendants \nassert that the Bumble App is a globally ac cessible platform and th e alleged collection of \nbiometric information using the App’s photo verification feature is not targeted at Illinois \nresidents. Defendants appear to concede that Bu mble Trading’s purported marketing activities in \nIllinois constitute purposeful direction or purposef ul availment, since they contend only that \nDzananovic’s BIPA claim does not arise from Bumble Trad ing’s marketing activ ities in Illinois. \nIndeed, Defendants admit that Bumble Trading operates the Bumble App and that it has \nconducted marketing activities in Il linois as part of its nationwi de advertising campaign for the \nBumble App. (Defs.’ Mem., Ex. 1, Rosas Decl. ¶¶ 13–14, Dkt. No. 30-1.) Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n6 \n Purposeful direction or purpos eful availment “focus[es] on th e acts and activities of the \ndefendant,” meaning that “speci fic personal jurisdiction cannot de pend solely on the actions of \nthe plaintiff or third parties.” Sheehan , 48 F.4th at 522–23 (citations omitted). In essence, the \ndefendant’s contacts with the fo rum state must not be  predicated on the “r andom, fortuitous, or \nattenuated contacts he makes by interacting with othe r persons affiliated with the State.” Id. at \n523 (quoting Walden , 571 U.S. at 286). Nonetheless, physical  presence in the fo rum state is not \nrequired for the defendant to have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state. NBA \nProps. , 46 F.4th at 624. And the Seventh Circuit has refused “to fashion a special jurisdictional \ntest for Internet-based cases.” Curry , 949 F.3d at 398 (citation omitte d). That said, a defendant’s \nmere operation or ownership of an  interactive website that is just accessible in the forum state \nshould not subject the defendant to  jurisdiction, without the defenda nt targeting the forum state. \nSee id.  at 400. Yet “[a] defendant’s deliberate and continuous exploitation of the market in a \nforum state, accomplished through its website as well as through other contacts with the state, \ncan be sufficient to establis h specific personal jurisdiction.”  Mobile Anesthesiologists Chi., LLC \nv. Anesthesia Assocs. of Hous. Metroplex, P.A. , 623 F.3d 440, 446 (7th Cir. 2010). \nThe Seventh Circuit’s decision in uBID, Inc. v. GoDaddy Group, Inc. , 623 F.3d 421 (7th \nCir. 2010), is instructive here. In uBID , a federal district court in Il linois had dismissed an action  \nagainst the operator of the domain name registration website  GoDaddy for lack of personal \njurisdiction. Id. at 425. In reversing the lower court’s di smissal, the Seventh Circuit found that \nthe district court did have pers onal jurisdiction over the defendant, citing “extensive marketing in \nIllinois and sales to Illinois customers.” Id. at 427. In a nutshell, th e Seventh Circuit concluded \nthat the defendant had deliberatel y exploited the Illinois market vi a its sales and advertisements \nto Illinois, even though it did not specifically target Illinois customers in its advertising. Id. at Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n7 \n 427–28; see also be2 LLC v. Ivanov , 642 F.3d 555, 559 (7th Cir. 2011) (describing the defendant \nin uBID  as “massive[ly] and successful[ly]” ex ploiting the Illinois market “through an \nadvertising campaign that produced  hundreds of thousands of custom ers in the state and millions \nof dollars in annual revenues”). Further, the Se venth Circuit rejected the defendant’s argument \nthat its sale of domain names to Illinois customer s were transactions unilaterally initiated by the \ncustomers since it “itself set the system up this way.”  uBID , 623 F.3d at 428–29. \nSimilarly, here, the Court finds that Bumble  Trading purposefully availed itself of the \nIllinois market for its dating a pp services by deliberately an d continuously exploiting that \nmarket. Defendants do not challenge Dzananovic’ s allegation that the Bumble App generates \nrevenue from thousands of paying us ers who are Illinois residents. ( See Am. Compl. ¶ 34.) To \nput a figure to this po tential revenue amount, in  the third quarter of 2021, the Bumble App is \nalleged to have had an average revenue of $30.99 per paying user. ( Id.) In addition, Bumble \nTrading has a nationwide advertis ing campaign for the Bu mble App (Rosas Decl. ¶ 14), and has \nconducted extensive marketing in Illinois ( see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 39–50). For instance, Bumble \nTrading has advertised the Bumble App on physi cal billboards in Chicago, launched verified \nphysical locations in Chicago cal led “BumbleSpot[s]” where peopl e can meet their matches and \nmingle safely, offered “DiningOut Passbooks” to users in Chicago, hosted happy hour events in \nChicago for individuals with Bumble profiles, conducted pri ze drawings for free dates for \nChicago users, sponsored booths at Chicago’s Lollapalooza festiv al, promoted and advertised \nsuccess stories of couples from Chicago who met on the App on their website, and employed \ncampus ambassadors at universities in Chica go to market and prom ote the app on their \ncampuses. ( Id. ¶¶ 39–50.) Moreover, Bumble Trading doe s not dispute Dzananovic’s assertion \nthat it collects PII from users for targeted mark eting purposes, including to personalize potential Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n8 \n matches, inform its product pipelin e, and identify users who are li kely to become paying users. \n(Id. ¶¶ 71, 83.) \nDefendants attempt to distinguish uBID  from the present case on the grounds that \nBumble Trading does not sell or ship products or  services to Illinois re sidents, and that any \nsubsequent steps after the user downloads th e App are user-driven, including using the photo \nverification feature. These argum ents are unpersuasive. As an initial matter, notwithstanding \nDefendants’ selective quotati ons, the Seventh Circuit in uBID did not hold that internet sales \ncould not be described as unilateral if the seller took significant steps both before and after sales; \ninstead, it summarized a previous ruling in another case in suppor t of the well-taken observation \nthat a defendant cannot set up a system so that customers in a state can take advantage of the \ndefendant’s services and then suggest that the cu stomers’ decisions to do so (with millions of \ndollars flowing to the defendant as a result) was “all their idea.” See uBID , 623 F.3d at 428 (“ See \nState of Illinois v. Hemi Group , 622 F.3d at 758–59 (misleading to describe internet sales as \n‘unilateral’ on part of  customers where seller took signi ficant steps both before and after \nsales).”). In any case, uBID  should not be interpreted as narro wly as Defendants suggest, as the \nmain point from the case is that the defendant  had exploited the Illi nois market through its \nadvertising campaign and signifi cant revenue from sales to its numerous Illinois customers. See \nNBA Props. , 46 F.4th at 622 (describing uBID ’s holding); be2 LLC , 642 F.3d at 559 (same). And \nmoreover, Bumble Trading’s alle ged collection and use of users’  PII for targeted marketing \nrefutes Defendants’ argument that  all the interactions after the user downloads the App are user-\ndriven.  \nIn sum, Dzananovic has made a sufficient showing that Bumble Trading purposefully \ndirected its activities toward Illinois and purpos efully availed itself of the Illinois market. Cf. Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 8 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n9 \n Chien v. Bumble Inc. , No. 3:22-cv-00020-GPC-NLS, 2022 WL 17069842, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. \nNov. 17, 2022) (determining that Bumble Trading continuously and deliber ately exploited the \nCalifornia market because the Bumble App was highly interactive, Bumble generated revenue \nfrom thousands of paying users in California, Bumble Trading collected personal and location \ninformation from California users to send target ed marketing and promotions, and the Bumble \nApp has forum-specific conten t such as displaying other users within the forum).  \nB. Bumble, Inc. and Buzz Holdings \nTurning to Bumble, Inc. and Buzz Holdings, Defendants contend that those entities did \nnot purposefully direct their activities toward Il linois because they are holding companies that do \nnot conduct any operating business whatsoever. \nIn the Complaint, Dzananovic alleges that Bumble, Inc. ow ns and operates the Bumble \nApp, derives revenue from the App, directs and controls the operat ions of Bumble Trading, is a \nparty to the App’s terms and conditions, and is  involved in the marketing of the App. ( See Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 14–16, 19, 21, 39–51.) As to Buzz Holdi ngs, Dzananovic also alleges that Buzz \nHoldings operates the Bumble App, derives revenue from paying users on the App, and is \ninvolved in the marketing of the App. ( See id.  ¶¶ 22, 34, 39–51.) Defendants,  in turn, contest \nthose allegations and offer in support Bumble In c.’s filings with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (“SEC”) and corporate governance gui delines as well as a declaration from \nChristopher Rosas, Bumble Trad ing’s Vice President of Tax a nd Treasury. Rosas states that \nBumble Inc. and Buzz Holdings are holding co mpanies that do not conduct any operating \nbusiness, that they do not generate any revenue from Illinois or elsewh ere, that they do not \nmarket the Bumble App, that they do not contro l or operate the Bumble App, and that they do \nnot collect or store information from Bumble App users. ( See Rosas Decl. ¶¶ 6, 9–12.) Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n10 \n Defendants further assert that th e SEC filings do not state that Buzz Holdings and Bumble Inc. \noperate the Bumble App.  \nConversely, Dzananovic points to a declaration in a separate  litigation from Caroline \nRoche, Bumble Trading’s Chief of Staff in 2021, wher e she states that Bumble , Inc. is the parent \ncompany of Bumble Trading, is in volved in the marketing decisions  of its subsidiaries, and is a \nparty to the Bumble App’s term s and conditions. (Pl.’s Resp. Br ., Ex. A, Roche Decl. ¶ 3, Dkt. \n34-1.) Additionally, despite Defe ndants’ protestations to th e contrary, the SEC filings \nspecifically describe Buzz Holdings and Bumble  Inc. as “providing onl ine dating and social \nnetworking platforms through subs cription and credit-based dati ng products” through “websites \nand applications that it owns and operates.” (D efs.’ Reply Br., Ex. A,  2020 SEC 10-K Filing at \n85, Dkt. No. 36-1; Defs.’ Reply Br., Ex. C, 2021 SEC 10-K Filing at 88, Dkt. No. 36-3.) The \nSEC filings further note that  Bumble operates the Bumble App, Bumble conducts brand \nmarketing and field marketing such as sponsorships and bran d ambassadorships, and Bumble \nemploys machine and deep learni ng to personalize user matches and inform its product pipeline. \n(2020 SEC 10-K Filing at 9–10, 12, 24, 54; 2021 SEC 10-K Filing at 9–10, 12, 24.) While \nDefendants claim that those statements do not refer to Bumble, Inc. or Buzz Holdings, the filings define “Bumble” or “[W]e” as re ferring to “Bumble, Inc. and its  consolidated subsidiaries.” \n(2020 SEC 10-K Filing at 5; 2021 SEC 10-K Filing at 5.) Without any additional information, \nthose statements describing Bumble’s activit ies plausibly include Bumble, Inc. and Buzz \nHoldings. \nResolving factual disputes in the filings and declarations in Dzananovic’s favor for \npresent purposes, Bumble, Inc. and Buzz Holdings have a role in the ope ration and marketing of \nthe Bumble App and leveraging of user data for targeted marketing. Thus, for the same reasons Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n11 \n as with respect to Bumble Tr ading, the Court concludes that Bumble, Inc. and Buzz Holdings \npurposefully availed themselves of  the Illinois market and purposef ully directed their activities \ntoward Illinois. Cf. Chien , 2022 WL 17069842, at *9–10 (finding pers onal jurisdiction at the \nmotion to dismiss stage and concluding that Bumb le, Inc. purposefully directed its activities \ntoward California in its capacity as a pa rent corporation and wa s involved in operating, \ndeveloping, marketing, and contro lling the Bumble App in light of the Roche declaration and \nSEC filings).1 \nII. “Arise Out of” or “Relate to” Defendants’ Forum Contacts \nThe Court next addresses whether Dzananovi c’s claim arises out of or relates to \nDefendants’ forum-related activit ies. Defendants argue that D zananovic’s BIPA claim, which \npertains to Defendants’ allege d collection of his biometric information thr ough the Bumble \nApp’s photo verification feat ure, does not arise out of or relate  to Bumble Trading’s marketing of \nthe App.  \nA “defendant’s minimum contacts with th e forum state [must] be suit-related.” Curry , \n949 F.3d at 400 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Bu t a strict causal connection \nbetween the defendant’s in-state activity and the plaintiff’s suit is not required. Ford Motor Co. \nv. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct. , 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1026 (2021); see also  NBA Props. , 46 F.4th at \n626 n.18 (noting that th e Supreme Court in Ford  rejected a direct causal inquiry for the “arising \nout of or related to” requiremen t of specific jurisdiction). While the “arise out of” prong “asks \nabout causation,” the “relate to ” prong “contemplates that so me relationships will support \n \n1 With respect to Buzz Holdings, the court in Chien  found that it did not have specific jurisdiction over it \nbecause the plaintiff’s complaint raised allegations  against Bumble Holding Limited of the United \nKingdom and not Buzz Holdings, despite the plaintiff confusingly identifying Buzz Holdings as a \ndefendant in the case caption. Chien , 2022 WL 17069842, at *5, *7. Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n12 \n jurisdiction without a causal showing.” Ford , 141 S. Ct. at 1026 (holdi ng that the plaintiffs’ \nproduct liability claims regarding injuries from de fective vehicles were closely related to the \ndefendants’ systematic servicing of the markets for those vehicles  in the forum states, despite \ndefendants not designing or manufact uring the vehicles in those stat es). That said, the “relate to” \nprong “incorporates real limits,” such that  not just any relationship will suffice.  See id. Simply \nput, “due process requires only th at the relationship among the de fendant, the forum[s], and the \nlitigation—is close enough to s upport specific jurisdiction.” NBA Props. , 46 F.4th at 626 n.18 \n(quoting Ford , 141 S. Ct. at 1032 (citation omitted)). \nDefendants cite Gullen v. Facebook.com, Inc. , No. 15 C 7681, 2016 WL 245910 (N.D. \nIll. Jan. 21, 2016), for their conten tion that a defendant’s marke ting and sales activities in a \nforum state are unrelated to alle gations of unlawful collection of biometric data in violation of \nBIPA. In Gullen , the plaintiff alleged th at Facebook.com, Inc. viol ated BIPA by obtaining his \nbiometric data from a photo of  him on the website using its “tag suggestion feature.” Id. at *1. \nThe court determined that although the defendant maintained a sales and advertising office in \nIllinois, that contact had no rela tionship to the plaint iff’s suit, which aros e from the defendant’s \n“alleged collection of biometric data from a photo, not from its sales,  marketing, or other \nbusiness activity in Illinois.” Id. at *2. But  Gullen  is readily distinguishab le from the allegations \nhere. Notably, Gullen  is a pre- Ford decision and, in any case, it would not be controlling \nprecedent for this Court. Additionally, Defendants’ forum-related activities are not limited just to \nmarketing the Bumble App in Illinois; rather , their forum-related activities also include \nexploitation of the Illinois ma rket for dating app services through its thousa nds of paying \ncustomers in Illinois and resul ting revenue. Further, the “tag suggestion feature” at issue in \nGullen  had nothing to do with the marketing and advertising of the defendant’s platform. Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n13 \n By contrast, there is a substantial connecti on between Defendants’ marketing activity and \nexploitation of the Illinois market and their allege d collection of biometric data via the “optional” \nphoto verification feature.2 According to Dzananovic, Bumb le is known for providing users \ngreater privacy and safety than comparable  dating apps. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 4–5.) Based on \nDzananovic’s allegations, the photo verification feature is part of  Defendants’ marketing strategy \nfor the Bumble App and how they attract users. In particular, Defendants promote the feature as \na way for users to connect with their matches comf ortably, catch fake profil es, and to ensure that \nthe person that they matched w ith is actually that person. ( See id.  ¶¶ 29, 36.) Indeed, in \nDefendants’ SEC filings, they em phasize that they “w ere among the first majo r dating apps to \nintroduce automated photo verification as a safe ty feature.” (2020 SEC 10-K Filing at 9; 2021 \nSEC 10-K Filing at 9.)  \nAt its core, Dzananovic’s suit is about De fendants deployment of the Bumble App’s \nphoto verification feature to coll ect his biometric in formation, which relates to Defendants’ \nmarketing of the Bumble App and its efforts to e xploit the Illinois market for dating app services, \nbecause the feature is a means to  entice users to the platform. Cf. Kukovec v. Estee Lauder Cos., \nInc., No. 22 CV 1988, 2022 WL 16744196, at *1, *4 (N .D. Ill. Nov. 7, 2022) (concluding that \nthe plaintiff’s BIPA suit—which alleged that the defendant’s optional makeup try-on tool on its \nwebsite collected her facial-geometry data—relat ed to the defendant’s sale of cosmetics in \nIllinois because the virtual try-on tool was part of the defendant’s sale s and marketing of its \ncosmetics); uBID , 623 F.3d at 430–31 (finding that the defend ant’s Illinois contacts related to the \nplaintiff’s claims because the de fendant reached its thousands of customers in Illinois with its \n \n2 It is unclear whether the photo verification feature is fully optional. Although Dzananovic alleges that \nuse of the feature is optional yet encouraged, he also  asserts that Defendants occasionally require users to \nverify themselves by providing a photo of themselves. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 29, 75.) Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n14 \n advertising by offering “free parkin g of a registrant’s domain nam e” and the plaintiff alleged that \nthe defendant used free parked pages with bad -faith intent to profit from the plaintiff’s \ntrademarks). Defendants have pr esented no authority suggesting th at marketing activity in the \nforum state must specifically me ntion a specific feature or benefi t of a platform, such as the \nphoto verification feature, for a connection to exist between the marketing ac tivity and the \nplaintiff’s claim—especially when th e feature is promoted nationally.  \nAccordingly, the Court determines that Dzan anovic’s BIPA claim re lates to Defendants’ \nforum activities. \nIII. Traditional Notions of Fa ir Play and Substantial Justice \nFinally, the Court considers whether exer cising jurisdiction ove r Defendants would \noffend traditional notions of fair  play and substantial justice. Defendants argue that this Court \nexercising jurisdiction over Defe ndants in Illinois would be unreas onable for three main reasons: \n(1) Defendants are entities formed  under the laws of Delaware w ith their principal places of \nbusiness in Texas; (2) the Bumble App is ava ilable worldwide and Bumble Trading conducts the \nsame marketing activities in Illinois as it does in other st ates; and (3) none of the Defendants \nhave offices or prope rty in Illinois.  \nIn evaluating the fairness factor, courts asse ss: the “burden on the defendant, the forum \nState’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plai ntiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and \neffective relief, the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution \nof the underlying dispute, and the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental \nsubstantive social policies.” NBA Props. , 46 F.4th at 627 (citations om itted). If the defendant has \npurposefully directed his activities at the forum state, “he must present a compelling case  that the Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 14 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n15 \n presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.” Id. (emphasis \nadded) (quoting Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 477 (1985)). \nHere, the Court finds that exercising ju risdiction over Defendants would not be \nunreasonable or unfair. Other than being out-of- state defendants, Defend ants do not claim any \nunusual burden in defending suit in Illinois. In addition, Defendants are multi-million-dollar \nentities with global reach, which milita tes against a finding of unfairness. Cf. Curry, 949 F.3d at \n402 (finding that the burden on the defendant to defend a suit in Illinois was minima l, despite the \ndefendant’s lack of physical presence in Illin ois, because it structur ed its marketing and \nnationwide business model to easi ly serve Illinois consumers); uBID , 623 F.3d at 432 (noting \nthat the defendant had a minimal burden in  defending suit since it was a sophisticated \ncorporation with a national reach); Illinois v. Hemi Group LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 760 (7th Cir. \n2010) (concluding that exercising ju risdiction over the defendant was fair where the defendant \nhad established an “expansive, sophisticated commercial venture online,” “held itself out to \nconduct business nationwide,” and succeeded in  “reaching customers across the country”). \nFurther, Illinois has an interest in providing a forum for its residents, such as Dzananovic and \nother class members, to seek redress for the coll ection of their biometric information in violation \nof BIPA, an Illinois statute. \nDefendants rely on Advanced Tactical Ordnance Systems,  LLC v. Real Action Paintball, \nInc., 751 F.3d 796, 803 (7th Cir. 2014), for the pr oposition that it would offend traditional \nnotions of fair play and substant ial justice to subject a defendant with an interactive website to \npersonal jurisdiction in every state where that website is accessible. As discussed above, \nhowever, Defendants have done more than just make the Bumble App accessible in Illinois; Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n16 \n \nspecifically, Defendants have used the Bumble A pp to purposefully avail itself of the Illinois \nmarket and have conducted target ing marketing in Illinois.  \nTherefore, the Court concludes that exer cising personal jurisdiction over Defendants \ncomports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. \nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Defe ndants’ motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 29) is \ndenied. \nENTERED: \n \n  \nDated:  July 7, 2023 __________________________  Andrea R.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   In the case of *Overjet, Inc. v. Videa Health, Inc.*, the court addressed Overjet's motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent Videa from allegedly infringing on its intellectual property and engaging in false advertising. Overjet, a dental AI company, utilizes AI to detect dental diseases by analyzing dental X-rays, and accused Videa of copying its color schemes and shapes for annotating X-rays, as well as falsely promoting its own AI capabilities. The court denied the preliminary injunction as Overjet failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n   The key legal issue is whether Overjet's color, shape, and shades used in annotating dental X-rays are copyrightable, whether Videa engaged in false advertising under the Lanham Act, and if a preliminary injunction should be granted.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court denied Overjet's motion for a preliminary injunction, concluding that Overjet did not provide adequate evidence to show it was likely to succeed on its copyright and false advertising claims, or suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine two tech companies, both making software for dentists to find cavities on X-rays. One company, Overjet, believes the other, Videa, is copying its special way of displaying colors and shapes on X-rays. Overjet asked a judge to stop Videa, claiming that this copying hurt its chances of winning work contracts and hurt its reputation. However, the judge decided there wasn't enough proof that Overjet would win the case or be seriously harmed, so she let Videa continue with its work while the court case goes on.",

BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Background \nOverjet  is a dental artificial intelligence (“AI”) company  form ed in 2018 and \nheadquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.  [ECF No. 1 (“Complaint” or “ Compl. ”) ¶¶ 8 –10].  \nOverjet uses AI to scan dental radiographic X -rays and detect dental disease s.  [Id. ¶ 9].  \nSpecifically, Overjet uses an approach called segmentation , which outlines exact borders and \nshows the extent to which pathologies, or diseases , exist .  [ECF No. 10 (“Inam Declaration” or \n“Inam Decl.”) ¶¶ 6, 7].  In order to enable its segmentation capabilities, Overjet’s software \nannotate s diseases  and structures on dental X-rays.  [ Id. ¶ 8].  Th e annotation  allows clinicians to \nbetter detect diseases and devise treatment plans.  [Compl. ¶ 33]; see also  [ECF Nos. 11-4, 11-5, \n11-6].  Overjet’s software segmentation capability has been  cleared  by the United S tates Food \nand Drug Administration (“FDA”)2 and, presently, Overjet is the only dental AI company with \n \n \n2 On May 19, 2021: the FDA cleared the “Overjet Dental Assist” product, which “is a \nradiological semi-automated image processing software intended to aid dental professionals in \nthe measurements of mesial and distal bone levels associated with each tooth from bitewing and periapical radiographs.” [Compl. ¶ 15].    On May 10, 2022: the FDA cleared “Overjet Caries Assist” (“Caries Assist”) for segmentation of \ncaries on bitewing radiographs.  [Compl. ¶ 16].    On March 27, 2023: the FDA cleared a new iteration of Caries Assist, which “expanded the age \nrange and image type and improved model accuracy for caries,” approving the software for use on patients twelve years of age and older.  [Compl. ¶ 17].    On December 16, 2022: the FDA cleared\n  “Overjet Calculus Assist ,” “a radiological automated \nconcurrent- read computer assisted detection software” used to detect interproximal calculus \n Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 2 of 313 \n \n clearance for “performing dental detection and segmentation to outline exactly where \npathol\nogies exist.”  [Compl. ¶ 10].  Overjet ’s software is used by d ental practices, dental services \norganizations (“DSOs”), and insurance companies.  [ Id. ¶ 6].   \nOverjet  has developed several iterations of its software.   [Compl. ¶ 14].  Adopting the \nnaming convention “Overjet [X] Assist,” it has named its software products “Overjet Dental Assist,” “Overjet Caries Assist,” “Overjet Calculus Assist,” “Overjet Periapical Radiolucency Assist,” and “Overjet Charting Assistant .”  [Id.].  Since May 2021, Overjet has been using the \n“DENTAL ASSIST ” trademark to market and sell its software.  [ Id. ¶ 22].   \nOverjet employs “color schemes, shapes, and designs ” to help visualize detection and \nsegmentation of diseases on dental X-rays.  [Compl. ¶ 29].  In the fall of 2023, Overjet  launched \nits “Anatomical Structures Visualization Tool”  (“Visualization Tool”)  for Overjet Caries Assist , \nwhich introduced the coloring scheme and design at issue in the instant motion.  [ Id.].  The  tool \nannotates X -rays, using white to represent enamel, purple to denote the pulp of a tooth, bright \ngreen lines with circles at the end s to indicate measurements of bone levels,  and red and \ntranslucency to mark areas of decay.  [ Id. ¶ 30; Inam Decl. ¶ 24 ].  Overjet chose these colors and \nshapes in order to create a “contrast with the gray scale” of the X -rays and with the ultimate goal \nof assisting with “patient assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning.”  [Compl. ¶¶ 33, 34].  It \n \n \ndeposits on bitewing and periapical radiographs, for patients eighteen years of age or older.  \n[Compl. ¶ 18].    On September 21, 2023: the FDA approved Overjet’s Periapical Radiolucency (“PARL”) Assist \nsoftware, “a radiological, automated, concurrent read computer- assisted detection software,” to \ndetect “periapical radiolucencies on permanent teeth captured on periapical radiographs.”  [Compl. ¶ 19].    On February 23, 2024: the FDA cleared “Overjet Charting Assist.”  [Compl. ¶ 18].   \n  Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 3 of 314 \n \n also selected  the de sign and colors to help with  brand identification; the purple, for example, \ncomplements Overjet’s purple brand color.  [ Id. ¶ 35].  Below is an example of an annotated X-\nray created by Overjet’s software using the segmentation approach.  [ Id. ¶¶ 35, 45].   \nVidea is a lso a dental AI company, [Compl. ¶ 55] ; see also  [ECF No. 22-1 ( “Hillen \nDecl.”) ¶ 1], and it is Overjet’s direct competitor , [Compl. ¶ 55; Inam Decl. ¶ 5 ; Hillen Decl.  \n¶ 24].  Founded in 2018, [Compl. ¶ 55; Hillen Decl. ¶ 2], Videa’s AI software program, VideaAI, \n“analyze[s]  radiographs and assist [s] clinicians in detecting and diagnosing oral diseases, ” \n[Hillen Decl . ¶¶ 4, 6].   \nVidea holds FDA clearance for  vari ous indications.  See [Compl. ¶ ¶ 66–69].  In \nDecember 2023, the FDA cleared “Videa Dental AI,” previously known as “Videa Dental Assist,”\n3 [Hillen Decl. ¶ ¶ 14, 26], for identifying and localizing a range of dental findings and  \nindications, including caries  or cavities  and periapical radiolucency,4 when analyzing bitewing, \n \n \n3 Videa used the term  “Dental Assist” from January to mid -March 2024.  [ECF No. 20 (“ Opp’n ”) \nat 10]. \n   \n4 In addition to dental indications, the FDA clearance also encompasses the identification and \nlocalization of historical treatments, such as a bridge, crown, or filling, and the detection of “normal anatomy.”  [ECF No. 11-7 (“ Videa 510(k) Premarket Notification ”) at 4].   \nCase 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 4 of 315 \n \n periapical , and panoramic X- ray s taken from patients three years of age and older.  [Videa \n510(k) Premarket Notification at 4].  If the software detects any indications, it “returns a set of \nbounding boxes representing the suspect dental finding.”  [ Id. at 7].  Unlike Overjet, VideaAI \noffers two views , or displays, of its software’s findings:  one for clinicians (the “Clinical View”)  \nand one for patients (the “Patient View”).  [Hillen Decl. ¶ 9].  The Clinical View is “primarily \nused to assist clinicians in detection and diagnosis ” and “uses boxes and lines with dots to \nquickly display these points of interest.”  [ Id.].  It is intended to be “an assistive tool.”  [ Id.].  The \nPatient View  provides a more accessible display “for added patient education and \ncomprehension,” and is designed to be a “communication tool for [] provider[s] .”  [Id.].  As \nsuch, unlike the Clinical View, it offers “a version of the results that are ‘segmented’ and \nhighlights the shape of the points of interest” by “show[ing] more than mere lines and boxes.”  \n[Id.].  See infra  examples of the Clinical and Patient View.  [ Id.; Compl. ¶ 88].  It is the Patient \nView that is at issue in the present case.  S ee infra.    \n \nAs noted above, the two companies are direct competitors in the dental AI space.  See  \nsupra.  As such, in the fall of 2023, both companies were considered for a lucrative partnership \nCase 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 5 of 316 \n \n with the country’s largest DSO, Heartland Dental  (“Heartland”) .  [Compl. ¶ 88].  On December \n5, 2023, Heartland announced that it had selected Videa as its dental AI partner.  [ Id. ¶ 90].5   \nB. Procedural History  \nOn February 23, 2024, Overjet initiated this action , [ECF No. 1], and filed the instant \nmotion for a preliminary injunction , [ECF No. 8].  Videa opposed the motion on March 19, \n2024, [Opp’n], and Overjet then filed a reply in support of its preliminary injunction motion on \nApril 2, 2024, [ECF No. 29 (“Reply”) ].  On April 9, 2024, Videa filed its sur- reply .  [ECF No. \n34 (“Sur -Reply”) ].  The Court heard oral argument on April 11, 2024.  [ECF No. 40].   \nII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Legal Standard  \nPreliminary injunctions function to “preserve the relative positions of the parties until a \ntrial o\nn the merits can be held.”  Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  As a \nresult, “findings of fact and conclusions of law made by a court granting a preliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the merits.”   Id. (citing Indus. Bank of Wash. v. Tobriner, 405 F.2d \n1321, 1324 (D.C. Cir. 1968)).  The granting of a preliminary injunction is “an ‘extraordinary and drastic remedy’ .  . . that ‘is never awarded as of right.’”  Voice of the Arab World, Inc. v. MDTV \nMed. News Now, Inc. , 645 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, \n689–90 (2008)). \nWhen deciding whether to grant a motion for preliminary injunction, courts must \ncons\nider four factors:  \n(i) the movant’ s likelihood of success on the merits of its claims; (ii) whether and to what \nextent the movant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is withheld; (iii) the \n \n \n5 Independent of this contract, Overjet currently works with over 150 Heartland D ental offices.  \n[Compl. ¶ 88].   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 6 of 317 \n \n balance of hardships as between the parties; and (iv) the effect, if any, that an injunction (or the withholding of one) may have on the public interest.  \nCorp. Techs., Inc. v. Harnett, 731 F.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 2013).  As the moving party, Overjet bears \nthe burden of satisfying each of these four elements.  See Nieves –Márquez v. P.R., 353 F.3d 108, \n120 (1st Cir. 2003). \nThe First Circuit has held that these four factors “are not entitled to equal weight in the \ndecisio\nnal calculus.”  Corp. Techs., 731 F.3d at 9.  Rather, the movant’s likelihood of success on \nthe merits “is the main bearing wall of the four -factor framework.”   Id. at 10.  “[P]roving \nlikelihood of success on the merits is the ‘sine qua non’ of a preliminary injunction.”  Arborjet, \nInc. v. Rainbow Treecare Sci. Advancements, Inc., 794 F.3d 168, 173 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting \nNew Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002)).  Therefore, \n“[i]f the moving party cannot demonstrate that [it] is likely to succeed in [its] quest, the \nremaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.”  Id. (quoting New Comm Wireless Servs. , \n287 F.3d at 9). \nB. Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n1. Copyright Infringement  \nTo establish copyright infringement, a plaintiff must show: (1) ownership of a valid \ncopyright i\nn a work; and (2) a copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.  \nSoc’y of the Holy Transfiguration Monastery, Inc. v. Archbishop Gregory of Denver, Colo., 685 \nF. Supp. 2d 217, 225 (D. Mass. 2010), aff ’d sub nom. Soc’y of Holy Transfiguration Monastery, \nInc. v. Gregory, 689 F.3d 29 (1st Cir. 2012).  “A plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the \nwork, as a whole, is original and that it has ‘ complied with the applicable statutory formalities. ’”  \nId. (quoting Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland, Int’ l., Inc. , 49 F.3d 807, 813 (1st Cir. 1995) , aff’d, 516 \nU.S. 233 (1996) ).  A certificate of copyright registration is “ prima facie  evidence of Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 7 of 318 \n \n copyrightability, and shift s the bur den to the defendant” to establish the invalidity of the \ncopyright.  Id.   \nOverjet avers that it owns a valid copyright for its source code.  [ECF No. 9 at 15] ; see \ngenerally  [ECF Nos. 11-23, 11-24 ( collectively, “Source Code”)].  Further, i n selecting the \n“shades and shapes to label and organize results generated by its [] software,” [ECF No. 9 at 15], \nthe company made “artistic choices about the shapes and forms those colors would embody,” [id.], and thereby created “expressive organizational choices . . . protected by copyright law,” \n[Reply at 5].   \nOverjet alleges that Videa’s Patient View copies its protected coloring scheme, shades, \nand shape.  [\nECF No. 9 at 9–11, 15; Reply at 6]; see also  [ECF No. 11-38]; compare [ECF No. \n11-32 (“Overjet Approach”) with  [ECF No. 11-10 (“Videa Approach”)].  Overjet first became \naware of Videa’s alleged infringement at the Heartland  Dental Conference on December 9, 2023, \nwhen Videa presented the Patient View at its trade booth and Florian Hillen, the company’s CEO, gave a presentation displaying images that purportedly copied Overjet’s Visualization  \nTool.  [Compl. ¶ 94; ECF No. 9 at 11; Reply  at 6].\n6  Over jet appears to suggest that Videa \nobtained the Visualization Tool when Overjet  released it to all Heartland Clinics  on November \n15, 2023.7  See [ Reply  at 6].  \n \n \n6 Overjet further argues that Videa falsely advertises that VideaAI has segmentation capabilities, \nwhen, in fact, it has only obtained FDA- clearance for the bounded box approach.  See infra .  \n \n7 Overjet claims that it began developing its segmentation visualization display in  July 2023, \nfinaliz ed its color and highlighting scheme by mid-August 2023, and started distributing its \nVisualization Tool to clients for feedback  a few weeks later, on September 11, 2023.  [Reply at \n6].   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 8 of 319 \n \n Videa counters that there has been no infringement.  [Opp’n at 17].  First, although Videa \ndoes not\n dispute the validity of Overjet’s Source Code copyright, it argues that Overjet ’s color \nscheme, shades, and shapes created by its software are not entitled to copyright protection \nbecause they merely serve a functional purpose.  [ Id. at 18–20; Sur-Reply at 4, 9–10].  Second, \nVidea claims  that it adopted  certain colors and shapes before Overjet did.  [Opp’n at 17–18].  A s \nearly as  April 2022, Videa began using color-coded lines to denote the level of radiographic bone \nloss (“RBL”) in its Clinical View.  [ Id. at 9].  S pecifically , it used green to indicate healthy gum \nlevels, yellow to mark that there is some risk, orange to denote an even greater risk, and red to highlight a “potential problem.”  [ Id.; Hillen Decl. ¶ 11].  “This ‘stoplight’ system . . . was \nadopted because [the company] believed it is intuitive for patients and clinicians.”  [Hillen Decl. ¶ 11].  At around the same time,  Videa also started using red boxes to indicate tooth decay, \n[Opp’n at 9], an “obvious color choice to indicate warning . . . and commonly used across industries,” [Hillen Decl. ¶ 12].  Moreover, at least as early as April 10, 2023, Videa “began developing its segmentation feature for Patient View.”  [Opp’n at 9] .  The Patient View \nsegmentation continued using the same color- coding as for RBL in its Clinical View and a lso \nincorporated “shades of red” to highlight decay, large measurements of gum recession, and periapical radiolucency; white to depict enamel; and blue for pulp.  [ Id.].  Third, Videa claims \nthat the decision to use white to indicate enamel and blue to demarcate pulp was made “without knowledge of Overjet’s scheme.”  [ Id. at 18].  Videa chose them  “because white is the color of \nenamel and blue provides contrast to render pulp more visible.”  [ Id.]; see generally  [ECF No. \n22-2 (“Clemens Decl.”) ].  According to Videa, these coloring decisions were  made as early as \nOctober 12, 2023, for the Clinical View, [Op p’n at 10], and launched in the Patient View by Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 9 of 3110 \n \n November 7, 2023, [id. at 18], which would have been before Overjet’s November 15 release, \n[id.].     \nThe Court first addresses  whether Overjet can show ownership of a valid copyright in  the \ncolors, shades, and shapes used to organize results generated by the software code, which turns \non whether those things are copyrightable.  Feist Pub l’ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. \n340, 348 (1991) (“The mere fact that a work is copyrighted does not mean that every element of the work may be protected.”) ; see also  17 U.S.C. § 102(b)  (“In no case does copyright protection \nfor an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.”) .  \nComputer programs, such as the one at issue here, see [ECF No. 9 at 15], are “afforded \ncopyright protection as literary works.”  e-Steps, LLC v. Am s. Leading Fin., LLC, No. 19- cv-\n01637, 2019 WL 9834429, at *2 (D.P.R. Sept. 25, 2019) (quoting Lotus, 49 F.3d at 813).  As \nsuch, they may be subject to literal , referring to  a program’s source code, or, as here, non- literal \ncopying, see [ECF No. 9 at 16; Opp’n at 19], which encompasses  a “program’s sequence, \nstructure, organization, and user interface. ”  McEnroe v. Mantissa Corp., No. 14- cv-12320, 2016 \nWL 7799636, at *9 n.6 (D. Mass. Feb. 29, 2016) .  In order to assess non- literal infringement \nclaims, courts in this Circuit apply the three -step “abstraction -filtration -comparison” test.   See id. \nat *9; see also  Lotus, 49 F.3d at 815; Torah Soft Ltd. v. Drosnin, 136 F. Supp. 2d 276, 284 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2001) ( the three-step analysis of abstraction -filtration -comparison first abstracts the \nprogram, then filters out unprotectable elements, and, third, compares the remaining protectable elements to the alleged infringer’s work to assess whether substantial similarity exists ) (citing  \nComput.  Assocs. Int’l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., 982 F.2d 693, 706 (2d Cir. 1992)).   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 10 of 3111 \n \n i. Abstraction  \nThe abstraction step requires the Court to “dissect the allegedly copied program’s \nstructure and isolate each level of abstraction contained within it.”  Altai, 982 F.2d at 707.  \nBecause Overjet has already identified the alleged protectable “materials ,” namely the shapes, \ncolors, and shading used in the annotation of X-rays, [ECF No. 9 at 16–17; Opp’n at 19], “this \nCourt need not engage in the abstraction process,” Real  View,  LLC  v. 20- 20 Techs.,  Inc., 683 F. \nSupp. 2d 147, 154 (D. Mass. 2010).  \nii. Filtration  \nThe filtration analysis, step 2, requires courts to determine whether the material s \nidentified in step 1 are copyrightable, by “filter ing” the material identified in step 1 through \n“constitutional and statutory requirements of originality , the Copyright Act’s  distinction between \nexpression and ideas or processes, the doctrines of ‘ merger ’ and ‘ scènes à faire, ’ and the public \ndomain exception.”  Torah , 136 F. Supp. 2d at 284 (at this stage, “the court filters out those \nelements that are not protectable.”) .  \na. Functionality  \nPursuant to § 102(b),8 the Court must distinguish  between the annotated X -rays \n“expressive aspects,” which can be copyrightable, and the functional aspects, which are uncopyrightable.  See e- Steps , 2019 WL 9834429, at *2  (citing Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google Inc., \n750 F.3d 1339, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2014)  (“anything that performs a function is necessarily \nuncopyrighta\nble”)).  Based on the record before the Court at this stage, it is not satisfied that \n \n \n8 “In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, \nprocedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of \nthe form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.”  17 U.S.C. § 102(b) .    Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 11 of 3112 \n \n Overjet’s use of colors  and shapes is  merely expressive.  The underlying impetus of the color \nscheme and display is seemingly to aid clinicians in carrying out dental diagnostics.  See [Inam \nDecl. ¶ 25].  Thus, although there may not be industry-standards or guidelines specifying what \ncolors and shapes may be used on an X-ray, it nevertheless appears intuitive to use certain specific colors to indicate problem areas or create contrast in order to efficiently identify pathologies, suggesting that Overjet’s color, shape, and shading decisions were primarily driven \nby functionality.  See, e.g. , [Compl. ¶ 34 (“Overjet touts the Anatomical Structures Visualization \nTool to customers and potential customers as a tremendous aid in patient education when it comes to explaining dental anatomy, disease detection, and disease progression on radiographs, as well as the proximity to vital structures such as the pulp.  Highlighting enamel and pulp allows for a richer understanding of the nature and severity of disease progression and a visual that matches dentists’ quantified AI finding.”)].   \nb. Originality  \nWith respect to originality, in order to be copyrightable, “[a] work must possess more \nthan a de minimis  quantum of creativity.”  Torah , 136 F. Supp. 2d at 285 (citing Fei st, 499 U.S. \nat 362).   Overjet seemingly concedes that the individual colors and shades do not individually \nmeet a min\nimum level of creativity , [Mot. Hr’g Tr. 13:7–14:11, 54:4–5] ; see also  [ECF No. 9 at \n16], but contends that the “overall design choices involved with what colors to use, what transparency and translucency to use, how to shade it, how to do the borders, [and] how to  make \nit look as a whole [] is [what  makes it ] protectable.”  [Mot. Hr’g Tr. 54:5–9]. \nCourts have found that in certain instances the creativity involved in the “selection, \ncoordina \ntion, and arrangement ” of elements that are by themselves not protectable may \nnonetheless meet  the originality requirement.

App’x 780 (10th Cir. 2010) ; see al so Feist , 499 U.S. at 358 (“[T]he \nprincipal focus should be on whether the selection, coordination, and arrangement are \nsufficiently original to merit protection.”).   Here, however, the Court does not find that Overjet’s \ndecision s concerning the use and arrangement of particular colors , shades, and shapes  is likely to  \nbe found sufficiently creative to merit copyright protection.     \nThe case Overjet relies on, namely Coquico, Inc. v. Rodriguez -Miran da, 562 F.3d 62, 68–\n69 (1st Cir. 2009), see [Mot. Hr’g Tr. a t 14], involved more complex selections and \narrangements.  As noted by the court in that case, “any attempt to create a stuffed -animal \nrendering of the [real -life frog] will involve countless artistic decisions . . . concerning the \nprecise size, shape, posture, color juxtaposition of features, stitching, and adornment of the toy.”  Coquico, 562 F.3d at 69.  Here, the Court does not find the same array of  “countless artistic \ndecisions” among individual ly unprotectable elements.  Overjet’s decision -making focused on \nhow to indicate caries, pulp, enamel, and bone level  measurements  on radiographic imaging, \nmeaning it organized and arranged only four colors (red, white, purple, and green) and two \nshapes (a line with circles at the end ).  See [Compl. ¶ 30].  This relatively modest combination of \nunprotectable elements , even taken together, are unlikely to  be original enough to warrant \ncopyrightability.  See Satava v. Lowry, 323 F.3d 805, 811 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding “that a \ncombination of unprotectable elements is eligible for copyright protection only if those elements are numerous enough and their selection and arrangement original enough that their combination constitutes an original work of authorship.”) ; see also  United States v. Hamilton , 583 F.2d 448, \n451 (9th Cir. 1978) ( ruling that “trivial elements of compilation and arrangement [] are not \ncopyrightable since they fall below the threshold of originality.” ).   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 13 of 3114 \n \n Similarly, in Wilson , the court considered whether, among other things, a plaintiff  who \nhad relied on pre-existing government maps and other public domain documents created \n“sufficiently original” maps based on how he “selected, coordinated, and arranged the expressive features of the map to depict its factual [non-copyrightable] content.”  666 F. Supp. 2d at 1254–55.  In finding that the plaintiff met the originality requirement, the court e mphasized the \nnumerous artistic decisions involved in generating the maps, including choosing the level of detail to depict, “what geographic features and roads to emphasize, what thickness of lines to use to delineate roads, how to indicate political boundaries, and many other details.”  Id. at 1257.  \nThe Court again notes the limited and fairly common elements at issue here  and cannot conclud e \nthat the same level of artistic decision -making informed Overjet’s choices.  See also  Silverstein \nv. Penguin Putnam , 522 F. Supp. 2d 579, 599 (“A compilation may lack the requisite creativity \nwhere . . .  the author made obvious, garden-variety, or routine selections.”) ; Real  View , 683 F. \nSupp. 2d at 15 7, 158 (noting the “numerous creative and expressive choices” when determining \nthat a screen display was copyrightable).  Because Overjet’s choice of colors, shades, and shapes Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 14 of 3115 \n \n is not sufficiently original, 9 it is unlikely to prevail on its copyright infringement claim  based \nupon the evidence before the Court at this stage.10  \n2. False Advertising U nder the Lanham Act  \nIn order to  prove a  claim for false advertising under the Lanham Act, a plaintiff  must \nshow that :   \n \n \n9 Videa also argues that the Copyright Office’s Compendium (“Compendium”) provides that \n“the enhancement of an x -ray is not something that would be protectable.”  [Mot. Hr’g Tr. 38:4–\n6]; see also  U.S. Copyright Office, Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices § 313.4(K) \n(3d. ed. 2021).  Overjet counters that an X -ray, according to the Compendium may be \ncopyrightable if “used as a tool for an author’s creative expression . . . [and] if the resulting \nimage contains a sufficient amount of artistic expression ,” [Mot. Hr’g Tr. 15:1–5].  Specifically,  \nOverjet points to § 909.3(B), which provides that “types of technologies [such as X- rays] [that] \nwere created for diagnostic or other functional purposes, [] can conceivably be used in an artistic manner. ”  Compendium § 909.3(B) (“an application for an x- ray of a farm animal that has been \nmodified with bright red colors and original images of processed food products []  . . . may [be] \nregister [ed] [], because [of] the creative expression in the work as a whole .”).  At this juncture, \nthe Court is not convinced that the annotations at issue here are comparable to the Compendium’s description of artistic expressions.  Regardless, the Court need not determine this issue as it has found that the arrangement of shapes and colors does not satisfy  the originality \nrequirement.  See  supra.   \n \n10 Separately, the Court notes that , based on the current record, it cannot determine whether \nactual copying occurred.  Videa contends that it had started using color-coded lines and other \ncolor schemes as early as April 2022 in its Clinical View , [Opp’n. at 9; Hillen Decl. ¶ 11 ], that it \nstarted developing its segmentation view for the Patient View in April 2023, [Clemens Decl. ¶ \n6], and that by November 7, 2023, it had adopted the color scheme currently at issue, which \nwould have been before Overjet’s November 15 release.  See  supra ; see also  TMTV, Corp. v. \nMass Prods., Inc., 345 F. Supp. 2d 196, 209 (D.P.R. 2004), aff ’d, 645 F.3d 464 (1st Cir. 2011) \n(once ownership of a valid copyright has been established, courts then need to establish whether \nillicit copying occurred  and, in so doing, “must initially determine that the defendant copied the \nprotected work.”); see also  Rohm & Haas Elec. Materials, LLC v. Elec. Cir s. Supplies, Inc., 759 \nF. Supp. 2d 110, 125 n.107 (D. Mass. 2010) (when “courts are faced with affidavits at odds and \nmust make a credibility determination between them, courts generally do not issue a preliminary \ninjunction, but rather leave the issue for a jury to resolve.” ); Spencer Co. v. Armonk Indus., Inc., \n489 F.2d 704, 707 (1st Cir. 1973) (affirming the refusal to issue a preliminary injunction as an \nappropriate exercise of discretion in light of a “major factual dispute” between the parties that \ncalled into question whether [the plaintiff] would ever prevail on the merits”).    Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 15 of 3116 \n \n (1) the d efendant made a false or misleading description of fact or representation \nof fact in a commercial advertisement about his own or another ’s product; (2) the \nmisrepresentation is material, in that it is likely to influence the purchasing decision; (3) the misrepresentation actually deceives or has the tendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience; (4) the defendant placed the false or \nmisleading statement in interstate commerce; and (5) the plaintiff has been or is \nlikely to be injured as  a result of the misrepresentation, either by direct diversion of \nsales or by a lessening of goodwill associated with its products.  \nHilsinger Co. v. Kleen Concepts, LLC, No. 14- cv-14714, 2017 WL\n  3841468, at *8 (D. Mass. \nSept. 1, 2017) (quoting Cashmere & Camel Hair Mfrs. Inst . v. Saks Fifth Ave., 284 F.3d 302, \n310–11 (1st Cir. 2002)) ; see also  15 U.S.C. § 1125(a).  “A plaintiff can succeed on a false \nadvertising claim by proving either that the defendant’ s advertisement is literally false or \nimplicitly false —that is, the advertisement is true or ambiguous yet misleading.”  Ca shmere, 284 \nF.3d at 311.  “ In assessing a Lanham Act claim for . . .  false advertising, a determination first \nmust be made as to what the statement by the defendant that grounds the claim communicates.”  \nAzurity Pharms., Inc. v. Edge Pharma, LLC, 45 F.4th 479, 486 (1st Cir. 2022) (citing Clorox Co. \nP. R. v. Proctor & Gamble Com. Co., 228 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir. 2000)).  Then, “[a] determination \nmust be made about whether that statement, given what it communicates, is either false and/or misleading.”  Id. (citing Clorox, 228 F.3d at 34 ).  This Circuit has recognized that a “literally \nfalse” statement may either be explicit or “convey[ed] by necessary implication,” meaning that a claim is considered false when, “considering the advertisement in its entirety, the audience would recognize the claim as readily as if it had been explicitly stated.”  Clorox, 228 F.3d at 34–\n35.  “Where the advertisement  is literally  false, a violation may be established without evidence \nof consumer deception.”   Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 311.  Where the advertisement is implicitly \nfalse, “an additional burden is placed upon the plaintiff to show that the advertisement . . . conveys a misleading message to the viewing public.”  Id. (quoting Cloro x, 228 F.3d at  33).  In \nthe context of preliminary injunctions, “a showing that the defendant’ s activities are likely to Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 16 of 3117 \n \n cause confusion or to deceive customers is sufficient to warrant [] relief .”  Id.;  see also  Quabaug \nRubber Co. v. Fabiano Shoe Co., 567 F.2d 154, 160 (1st Cir. 1977) (holding that “a showing that \nthe defendant’s activities are likely to cause confusion or to deceive customers suffices to \nwarrant relief, at least in cases where injunctive relief is requested.”).    \ni. False or Misleading Statements  \nOverjet avers that several statements in Videa’s promotional materials, including a \nLinkedIn post, videos, and blog posts, improperly state that (1) “Videa’s  software is safe and \neffective for various medical purposes,” even though it had not obtained the relevant FDA clearance, or (2) that it had “reached a technological milestone in AI development before Overjet, when exactly the reverse was true.”  [ECF No.  9 at 19–20].  Videa counters that none of \nthe statements are literally false or misleading, and, if anything, amount to “quintessential puffery.”  [Opp’n at 22–23].  The Court reviews each of the alleged misrepresentations .     \nStatement # 1 :  In\n  a LinkedIn post from December 2023, whic h has since been deleted, \n[Hillen Decl. ¶ 29], Videa stated , “[h]ear from the clinicians  who are experiencing firsthand \nVideaAI’s transformative power .”  [ECF No. 11-19].  Overjet alleges that the  X-ray \naccompanying the statement implied that Videa had FDA clearance for segmentation  when, in \nreality, the FDA had only cleared Videa’s “bounding box” approach.  See [ECF No. 9 at 7].   \nBecause Videa is in fact an AI platform, the  statement is not explicitly false.  The Court \ncannot, however,  without the benefit of the full LinkedIn post, assess the extent to which Videa’s \nstatement , in light of the accompanying X- ray, is misleading , and refrains from evaluating \nStatement # 1 under the first prong of the Lanham Act at this juncture .  \nStatement # 2:  In a blog post dated April 5, 2021, Videa represented  tha t its AI software \ncan “aid in the diagnosis and prediction of the progression of diseases such as caries or Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 17 of 3127 \n \n the actors involved and the considerable monetary value of potential contracts, the sales process \nis thorough a\nnd lengthy, with a heavy focus on the software’s actual capabilities , including \nrelevant FDA clearance.  The Court is therefore not persuaded that, at this stage, Overjet will \nprevail on the materiality element and need not continue its analysis under the Lanham Act.  \nEncompass Ins. Co. of MA v. Giampa, 522 F. Supp. 2d 300, 311 (D. Mass. 2007) (“ [F]ailure to \nallege factual support for any of the[] elements is fatal to a claim for false advertising under the \nLanham Act.”).  Nevertheless, fo r completeness, the Court finds that Overjet is  also unlikely to \nmake a sufficient showing  in relation to deception and injury.   \niii. Deception  \nWhen considering injunctive relief, consumer deception is presumed for literal falsity \nclaims .  See Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 314.  For the statements that are literally false, namely \nStatements # 5, 7–10, Overjet would not need to “ demonstrate actual consumer deception.”15  \nBalance Dynamics Corp. v. Schmitt Indus., Inc., 204 F.3d 683, 693 (6th Cir. 2000).  For \nStatement #11, which the Court has deemed impliedly false, Overjet would only need to show that it is  “likely to cause confusion or to deceive customers.”  Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 311.  \nOverjet is unlikely to meet that burden.16   \nThe crux of Overjet’s argument is that Videa “advertises software for use as a safe and \neffective medical device,” when it in fact lacks “the advertised indicia of safety and \n \n \n15 The Court notes that Videa has since cured all but two statements ( #5 and #11).  This weighs \nagainst a finding of irreparable harm.  See infra .     \n \n16 Separately, Overjet “would still be able to avail [itself]  of a presumption of consumer \ndeception” on the alternative ground that Videa “intentionally set out to deceive or mislead \ncostumers.”  Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 316.  B ecause Overjet did not allege facts establishing that \nVidea acted deliberately to deceive customers, the company is not entitled to this presumption.   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 27 of 3128 \n \n effectiveness, and that it is even possible that Videa has not developed or included segmentation \ncap\nabilities in its software.”  [ECF No. 9 at 20].  Overjet , does not, however, articulate how the \nmisrepresentations tend to cause consumer deception.  As noted supra, both Videa and Overjet \noperate in a space with sophisticated customers.  It seems reasonable that discussions surrounding relevant FDA clearance—and verification thereof— are a critical component of the \nsales process.   A few promotional videos and blog posts, it appears, are unlikely to cause \nconsumer deception among the relevant pool of potential consumers.   \niv. Interstate Commerce  \nThere is no dispute that by posting the alleged misrepresentations online, including on \nVidea’s website, LinkedIn, and YouTube, Videa placed them into interstate commerce.  See \nMcGrath & Co., LLC v. PCM Consulting, Inc., No. 11- cv-10930, 2012 WL  503629, at *6 (D . \nMass. Feb 15, 2012) (“Courts have generally held that when one operates a website containing alleged false or misleading statements, the party causes those statements to enter interstate commerce through the internet.”).\n \nv. Injury  \nThe final element in the Lanham Act analysis requires Overjet to show that it has been or \nis likely to be injured because of  the alleged misrepresentations.  In the context of injunctive \nrelief, a “showing that the defendant’s activities are likely to cause confusion or to deceive customers is sufficient.”  Cashmere, 284 F.3d at 311 (by contrast, “a plaintiff seeking damages \nmust show actual harm to its business.”).  Specifically, when the advertisements are literally \nfalse,  “only a slight likelihood of injury need be shown to warrant injunctive relief.”  Camel \nHair, 799 F.2d at 15.   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 28 of 3129 \n \n In light of the discussion above, the Court finds that Overjet is unlikely to meet its burden  \non this el\nement.  In relation to Overjet’s allegations of reputational harm, it “has presented \nnothing beyond mere conjecture with regard to the anticipated harm to [its] reputation.”  \nRiverdale Mills Corp. v. Cavatorta N. Am., Inc., 146 F. Supp. 3d 356, 362 (D. Mass. 2015).  It \nhas also not established that it suffered a loss of customers due to Videa’s actions, including that Heartland’s decision to partner with Videa,  [Compl. ¶ 90], was influenced  by the alleged \nmisrepresentations, see generally  [ECF No. 9; Reply].  Accordingly, the Court does not find that \nthere is  a likelihood of injury.  \n3. Unfair Competition  \nOverjet  further contends that Videa’s purported false and misleading advertisements \nviolate\n state law, specifically Mass. Gen. L. ch. 266, § 91 and ch. 93A, § 11.17  [ECF No. 9 at \n21–22].   These claims “rise[] or fall[] with the federal claim.”  Arborjet, Inc. v. Rainbow Treecare \nSci. Advancements, Inc. , 63 F. Supp. 3d 149, 157 (D. Mass.  2014) , rev’d in part on other \ngrounds, 794 F.3d 168 (1st Cir. 2015)  (quoting Am . Med. Sys., Inc. v. Biolitec, Inc., 774 F. \nSupp. 2d 375, 393 (D. Mass.  2011) ) (regarding ch. 266, § 91) ; Milk S t. Cafe, Inc. v. CPK Media, \nLLC , No. 16- cv-11416, 2017 WL 3425170, at *12 (D. Mass. Aug. 9, 2017) (regarding ch. 93A, \n§ 11).  Because the Court concludes that Overjet is unlikely to prevail on its federal claim, the company’s state claims are likely to fail, too.    \n \n \n17 Because the Court has determined that Overjet is unlikely to prevail on the false  \nadvertising claim under the Lanham Act, it need not consider the argument that Videa unfairly \ncompetes against  Overjet  by copying the company’s “playbook.”  [ECF No. 9 at 22].   Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 29 of 3130 \n \n C. Irreparable Harm  \n“[I]f the moving party cannot demonstrate that he is likely to succeed in his quest, the \nremain\ning factors become matters of idle curiosity.”  Arborjet , 794 F.3d at 173 (quoting New \nComm Wireless Servs. , 287 F.3d at 9).  The Court nonetheless notes, however, that Overjet also \nwould likely have been unable to make a sufficient showing of irreparable harm. \n“Plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief must make a ‘clear showing’ that substantial and \nimmedia\nte irreparable harm is ‘likely’ in the absence of an injunction.”  Oxford Immunotec Ltd. \nv. Qiagen, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 3d 358, 367 (D. Mass. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  “[E]conomic loss alone does not usually rise to the level \nof irreparable harm which a party must establish to obtain a preliminary injunction.”  Suero v. \nFed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., No. 13- cv-13014, 2013 WL 6709001, at *7 (D. Mass. Dec. 17, \n2013) (quoting Hull Mun. Lighting Plant v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 506 N.E.2d 140, \n142 ( Mass. 1987)).  If, however, “the loss threatens the very existence of the movant’ s business,” \neconomic losses may be sufficient.   Id. \nOverjet’s  claims that it is likely to lose customers and future business and its first mover -\nadvantage, as well as suffer harm to its reputation and brand, are overly speculative.  The \ncompany has not substantiated these claims or provided any indication that it lost the Heartland contract because of Videa’s alleged wrongful actions.  See Spruce Env’t Techs., Inc., 2015 WL \n4038802, at *5 (concluding that because plaintiff alleged that at least one customer had been affected by defendant’s false advertisemen t it had “demonstrated a modicum of irreparable harm \nto its goodwill and reputation.” ).   \nFurther, i n relation to the false advertis ing c\n laim, all of the  misrepresentations  the Court \nhas deemed literally false, Statements # 5, 7–10, have been cured.  See supra.  This weighs Case 1:24-cv-10446-ADB     Document 50     Filed 07/19/24     Page 30 of 3131 \n \n significantly against a finding of irreparable harm, as it not only reduces the likelihood of injury \nto Ove\nrjet’s reputation, but also the loss of future business.  See Riverdale Mills Corp. , 146 F. \nSupp. 3d at  363.   \nIII. CONCLUSION  Accordingly, Overjet’ s mot\n ion for a preliminary injunction, [ECF No. 8], is  DENIED . \nOverjet  has failed to make a sufficient showing that it is likely  to succeed on the merits.  At this \ntime, Overjet has failed to demonstrate that the color, shape, and shades used in its Visualization Tool are copyrightable, that Videa has made materially false and misleading statements when advertising its products, or that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm.   \nSO ORDERED.    \n      \n             \nJuly 19, 2024 /s/ A llison D.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The case involves Dr. Adekunle C. Omoyosi, who alleged racial discrimination against the Texas Health & Human Services Commission under Title VII for not hiring him for several positions he applied for. Additionally, Dr. Omoyosi challenged the defendant's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and sought various injunctive reliefs, but the court dismissed his complaints due to lack of standing and failure to establish a claim.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Dr. Omoyosi's allegations of racial discrimination and his other claims related to the COVID-19 response by the Texas Health & Human Services Commission state a valid legal claim under Title VII and other applicable laws.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that Dr. Omoyosi did not have standing to challenge the defendant’s COVID-19 response and failed to state a plausible claim of racial discrimination under Title VII. The court also determined that sovereign immunity barred some of his claims and denied his motion to further amend the complaint as futile.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine someone applied for several jobs at a state health department and claimed they weren't hired because of racial discrimination. This person also argued that the department's approach to handling COVID-19 was inadequate and wanted the court to force the department to change its policies. The court decided not to proceed with the case because the person couldn't show they were harmed in a specific way by the department's actions, and their job applications didn't prove the department acted unfairly. The court also said that even if the person was right, some of their claims couldn't be decided in court due to the rules that protect government agencies from being sued in certain situations.",

Defendant seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s entire Amended Complaint,  arguing that \nPlaintiff  has failed to state  a Title VII claim and that Plaintiff lacks standing to challenge \nDefendant’s COVID -19 responses.  Plaintiff did not file a timely response to the Motion but has \nsought leave to amend his Amended Complaint .  The Court now  recommends that D efendant’s \nMotion to Dismiss  be granted and Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend his Amended Complaint be denied. \nII.  ANAL YSIS  \nA.  Plaintiff’s challenges to Defendant’s handling of the COVID -19 pandemic should be \ndismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).  \n \n1.  Rule 12(b)(1) Standards  \n \nDefendant argues Plaintiff’s challenges to its COVID -19 response must be dismissed for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction because (1) Plaintiff does not have standing to bring the \nchallenge and (2) Defendant’s sovereign immunity is a jurisdictional bar to the claims.  \nStanding to sue is a doctrine rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or \ncontroversy.  The doctrine developed in our case law to ensure that federal courts \ndo not exceed their authority as it has been traditionally understood.  The d octrine \nlimits the category of litigants empowered to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 2 of 12 3 seek redress for a legal wrong. In this way, “ [t]he law  of Article III standing  . . . \nserves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the \npolitical branches, ” and confines the federal courts to a properly judicial role [.] \n \nSpokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1547 (2016), as  revised (May 24, 2016)  (internal citations \nomitted).  Thus, a m otion to dismiss for lack of standing is  properly considered under  Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure  12(b)( 1).  See  Little v. KPMG LLP , 575 F.3d 533, 540- 41 (dismissing claim \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) where plaintiff’s claim was too speculative to confer standing) .  \nLikewise, claims barred by Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity must be dismissed under \nRule 12(b)(1).  Warnock v. Pecos County, Texas , 88 F.3d 341, 343 (5th Cir. 1996)  \n(“Because sovereign immunity  deprives the co urt of jurisdiction, the claims barred \nby sovereign immunity  can be dismissed  only under  Rule  12(b)(1) and not with prejudice.”) .   \nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss under  Rule  12(b)(1), a court must “take the well- pled \nfactual allegations of the complaint as true and view them in the light most favorable to the \nplaintiff.”   Griener v. U.S., 900 F.3d 700, 703 (5th Cir. 2018)  (quot ations omitted ).  “This analysis \nis generally confined to a review of the complaint and its proper attachments.”   Lane v . Halliurton, \n529 F.3d 548, 557 (5th Cir. 2008) .  Under  Rule 12(b)(1) , however, “the court may find a plausible \nset of facts by considering any of the following: (1) the complaint alone; (2) the complaint \nsupplemented by the undisputed facts evidenced in t he record; or (3) the complaint supplemented \nby undisputed facts plus the court’s resolution of disputed facts.”   Id. (quotations omitted).   The \nplaintiff bears the burden of establishing subject matter jurisdiction.  Exelon Wind 1, L.L.C. v. \nNelson , 766 F .3d 380, 388 (5th Cir. 2014) (citations omitted) . \n2.  Plaintiff  has no standing to challenge  Defendant’s COVID- 19 response.  \nThe Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s challenges to Defendant’s COVID -\n19 response unless Plaintiff has standing  to bring those challenges.  See Rivera v. Wyeth -Ayerst Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 3 of 12 4 Labs., 283 F.3d 215, 219 (5th Cir. 2002) (“[W]e must decide standing fi rst, because it determines \nthe court’s fundamental power even to hear the suit.” ).  Standing requires the p laintiff plead an (1) \ninjury in fact (2) fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant (3) that is likely to be \nredressed by a favorable judicial decision.  Spokeo, 136 S.Ct. at 1547.  In this case, Plaintiff must \nestablish  he suffered an injury in fact , fairly traceable to Defendant ’s response to the COVID -19 \npandemic , and that a favorable judicial decision would likely redress his injury. \n“To establish an injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he suffered ‘an invasion of a \nlegally protected interest’ that is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not \nconjectural or hypothetical.’”   Id. (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 \n(1992) ).  “For an injury to be ‘particularized,’ it must affect the plaintiff in a personal and \nindividual way.”   Id.  (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 n.1) .  “A ‘concrete’ injury must be ‘ de facto ’; \nthat is, it must actually exist.”   Id.  “The injury in fact test requires more than an injury to a \ncognizable interest.   It requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured.”   \nRivera , 283 F.3d at 320 (alteration omitted) (quoting Sierra Club v. Morton , 405 U.S. 727, 734- 35 \n(1972)) .  Plaintiff has failed to allege such an injury in this case.  Plaintiff merely alleges  \n[Defendant], the Texas government’s administrator of health and human services, \nbreached their duty of improving the health, safety  and well -being of Texans with \ngood stewardship of public resources; in the syndemic of health disparities, \ndisparate impact, and the COVID -19 pandemic – an irreparable injury to the \nPlaintiff as a Black -American man, Healthcare Provider, and Texan . \n \nECF N o. 11 at 5.   Under the most favorable interpretation of Plaintiff ’s Amended Complaint , he \nappears to allege that Defendant  failed to act in response to various developments in the COVID -\n19 pandemic  and that those failure s have particularly affected minority and low socioeconomic \ngroups .2  Plaintiff, a self -described “Black -American man, Healthcare Provider, and Texan[,]”  has \n \n2 Specifically, Plaintiff alleges Defendant “commissioned no further actions or statements” related to COVID -19 after \n(1) Governor Abbott declared a state of disaster and the Texas Department of State Health Services declared a public Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 4 of 12 5 failed to identify any particularized , concrete injury he  has suffered  as a result of the Defendant’s \nresponse to the COVID -19 pandemic .  Plaintiff ’s allegations of a special interest  in Defendant’s \nhandling of the pandemic  as a Black Texan  fail to demonstrate he has suffered a particularized  \ninjury in fact  and his claims must be dismissed  for lack of standing.3  \n3.  Defendant’s sovereign immunity bars subject matter jurisdiction in this Court . \n \nEven if Plaintiff had alleged a concrete, particularized injury in fact, his claims must still \nbe dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) because sove reign immunity operates as a jurisdictional \nbar to his  claims.   “Absent an unequivocal waiver or congressional abrogation, the Eleventh \nAmendment bars suits in federal court by a state’s citizens against their own state or a state agency \nor department.”  Houston Home Dialysis v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Tex., Civil Action No. H -\n17-2095, 2018 WL 5249996, at *7 (S.D. Tex. Oct. 22, 2018) (citing Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid \nPostsecondary Educ. Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 669- 70 (1999); Clark v. Tarrant Cty., Tex., 798 \nF.2d 736, 743 (5th Cir. 1986); U.S.  CONST . amend. XI).  Thus, Defendant, as a Texas state agency, \nis entitled to the protections of sovereign immunity  and dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) is \nrecom mended on this basis as well .  See Cephus v. Texas Health and Human Services Comm’n, \n \nhealth disaster; (2) L ieutenant Governor Patrick “insinuate[d]” that “racial and socioeconomic groups were to be \nscarified for the economy”; (3) the United States authorized Defendant to extend coverage for SNAP and Medicaid; \n(4) Defendant reported confirmed COVID- 19 cases 13% of  Texas nursing homes; (5) Governor Abbott began \nreopening the economy; (6) Defendant received $54 million through the CARES Act to provide COVID -19 relief for \ndisability and geriatric services; (7) Governor Abbott extended the disaster declaration; (8) D efendant was authorized \nby the USDA to provide over $1 billion in benefits to families without access to free or reduced meals at school due; \n(9) Governor Abbott began reversing Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo ’s call for reinstatement of a stay -at-home \norder; (10) Attorney General Paxton opposed expansion of absentee voting in Harris County; and (11) Attorney \nGeneral Paxton challenged a two -week shutdown of non- essential business ordered by El Paso County Judge Ricardo \nSamaniego.  \n3Plaintiff’s Amended Compl aint contains two allegations unrelated to Defendant’s handling of the COVID- 19 \npandemic  which must also be dismissed for lack of standing: (1) that Former Assistant Texas Attorney General Nick \nMoutos was “involuntary (sic) separated” for tweets that used extreme language against an individual or a group that \neither implies a direct threat that physical force will be used against them, or is seen as an indirect call for others to \nuse it[]” and (2) that “seven executives in the upper tiers of the [Attorney G eneral’s] office” released a statement that \nAttorney General Paxton was violating federal or state law due to improper influence, abuse of office, and bribery.  \nPlaintiff has failed to plead an injury in fact and, therefore, these claims  also must be dismi ssed for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1).  \n Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 5 of 12 6 146 F. Supp. 3d 818, 827 (S.D. Tex. 2015) (finding Defendant entitled to sovereign immunity as \na state agency).  \nB.  Plaintiff ’s Title VII claims should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  \n1.  Rule 12(b)(6) Standards  \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the plaintiff must plead “enough facts to state a claim \nto relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  “A \nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the conduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Gonzalez v. Kay , 577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir. 2009).  In reviewing a \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), this Court accepts all well -pleaded facts as true, viewing \nthem in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Alexander v. AmeriPro Funding, Inc ., 48 F.3d 68, \n701 (5th Cir. 2017) (citing Martin K. Eby Constr. Co. v. Dallas Area Rapid Transit , 369 F.3d 464, \n467 (5th Cir. 2004)).  However, the Court does not apply the same presumption to conclusory \nstatements or legal conclusions.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. a t 678- 79. \n2.  Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for failure  to hire under Title VII.  \nA failure or refusal to h ire an individual due to “race, color, religion, sex, or national origin”  \nviolates Title VII.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -2(a)(1).  To establish a clai m for discriminatory failure to \nhire, Plaintiff must show (1) he was in the protected class; (2) he applied for and was qualified for \nthe position sought; (3) he was not selected; and (4) after rejection, another applicant outside the \nprotected class was h ired.  Scott -Benson v. KBR, Inc., 826 F. App’x 364, 368 (5th Cir. 2020) \n(citations omitted).  Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 6 of 12 7 Plaintiff alleges in the Amended Complaint that (1) he is a Black -American man; (2) he \nsubmitted applications to Defendant for four different p ositions;4 (3) Defendant failed to hire him \nas a result  of “a seemingly neutral policy or procedure of obstructionism by blocking, demoting, \nand interference ”; (4) the applicants  hired to fill the positions  were from outside his protected class; \nand ( 5) he met many qualifications for the positions .5  Although Plaintiff makes conclusory \nallegations in his Amended Complaint, he fails to allege specific facts from which the Court could \ndraw the reasonable inferences that he was a qualified applicant for the positions and that the \nindividuals hired to fill the positions were outside his protected class .  See Sherrod v. Prairie View \nA&M Uni. , Civil Action No. H -10-1858, 2011 WL 843936, at *10 (S.D. Tex. Mar. 8, 2011) \n(quoting Fernandez -Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass’n , 987 F.2d 278, 284 (5th Cir. 1993) (“Conclusory \nallegations or legal conclusions masquerading as factual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a \nmotion to di smiss.”).  \nPlaintiff provides no facts explain ing the nature or duties of the positions for which he \napplied .  Plaintiff provides no facts showing his previous experiences or qualifications are relevant \nto the positions  for which he applied.   Absent specifi c facts describing the duties of the positions \nand why his professional experience  qualified him for the positions, his disc riminatory failure to \n \n4 Plaintiff alleges he applied for the positions of: Emerging & Acute Infections Disease Unit Director; Vaccine \nManagement Group Manager; Chief Information Officer; and Chief Program and Services Office.  \n5 Defendant lists his alleged qualifications as : \nunder graduate research experience building a bioinformatics database with a former Program \nDirector of the National Science Foundation; Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience at the only \nHistorically Black College and/or University (HBCU) in the World’s Largest Medical Center, Texas \nMedical Center; a corporate partnership with Nvidia, the Artificial Intelligence computing company; \n6+ years of Register Pharmacist experience, with vacci ne administration certification; 11+ years of \nHealthcare Industry experience; Bachelors of Science in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, as a \nCharles Drew Science Scholar; a cum laude Pharmacy Doctorate (PharmD); and specialized training \nfrom the Departme nt of Defense (DoD) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \n- specifically Forecasting Techniques, Predictive Analysis & Systems Engineering, Information \nTechnology Service Management, Program Leadership, and Exercising Continuity Plans for \nPand emics.  \nECF No.  11 at 2.  Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 7 of 12 8 hire claim  is not plausible .   See Corrica v. American Airlines , Civil Action No. 3:20- CV-0679- B, \n2020 WL 7711830, at *6 (N.D. Tex. Dec. 28, 2020)  (finding insufficient  facts to draw inference \nthat the plaintiff was qualified for a position where she failed to state the duties of the position or \nwhether the position wa s similar to her past jobs).   Because Plai ntiff has failed to  plead enough \nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face that would allow  the Court to draw the \nreasonable inference that Defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged, his failure to hire claim \nunder Title VII must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  Sherrod, 2011 WL 843936, at *3 \n(quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at  547; Iqbal , 556 U.S. at  663). \n3.  Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for disparate impact under Title VII.  \n To the extent Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint  can be interpreted to allege a cause of action \nfor discriminatory impact, he has failed to state a cognizable claim under Title VII.6  To state a \nclaim of discrimination under a disparate -impact theory, Plaintiff must show (1) an identifiable, \nfacially neutral personnel poli cy or practice; (2) a disparate effect on members of a protected class; \nand (3) a causal connection between the two.”   Bazile v. City of Houston , 858 F. Supp. 2d 718, 762 \n(S.D. Tex. 2012) (quotations omitted).  In effect, a disparate- impact discrimination plaintiff must  \nshow an employment practice “falls more harshly on one group than another and cannot be \njustified by business necessity.”   Roberts  v. U.S. Postmaster General , 947 F. Supp. 282, 288 (E.D. \nTex. 1996)  (citations omitted).  \nPlaintiff  has failed to allege a particular policy or procedure that  disparately affected \nmembers of his protected class.  Furthermore, even had Plaintiff sufficiently identified a specific \npolicy and a disparate impact, he has failed to plead any facts from which the Court could \nreasonably infer a causal connection between any of Defendant’s policies or procedures and a \n \n6Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint alleges Defendant “implemented a seemingly neutral policy or procedure of \nobstructionism by blocking, demoting and interference” that resulted in the failure to hire him.    Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 8 of 12 9 disparate impact.  Plaintiff alleges that “[o]n or about 2020/09/20, a Texas  Workforce Commission \nCivil Rights Division preliminary determination concluded [Defendant’s] seemingly neutral \npolicy or procedure of obstructionism by blocking, demoting, and interference were not a business \nnecessity  . . . .”   ECF No. 11 at 2.  This general allegation is insufficient to state a claim for disparate \nimpact under Title VII.   As a result, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim for disparate impact under \nTitle VII and the claim should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).7 \nC.  Plaintiff’s claim for injunctive relief is moot.  \n Defendant  also seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief .  Because each of \nPlaintiff’s claims has been dismissed either for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or for failure to \nstate a claim, Plaintiff’s claim for injunctive relief is moot and should be  dismissed.   See Sahara \nHealth Care, Inc. v. Azar , 349 F. Supp. 3d 555, 562 ( S.D. Tex. Nov. 1, 2018) ( explaining the \ncourt’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state \na claim moots the plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief “because no claims remain for injunctive \nrelief.” ). \nD.  Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend  is denied as futile  and, therefore, his case should be dismissed \nwith prejudice . \n \n Pursuant to Federal Rule  of Civil Procedure  15(a),8 leave to amend pleadings “shall be \nfreely given when justice so requires.”   FED. R. CIV. P. 15(a) .  Although Rule 15(a) “evinces a bias \nin favor of granting leave to amend[,] ” Goldstein v. MCI WorldCom , 340 F.3d 238, 254 (5th Cir. \n2003)  (citations omitted ), that leave is “by no means automatic, and the decision to grant or deny \n \n7 Plaintiff  lists Title VII and Title VI as bases fo r federal subject matter jurisdiction over this case.  Title VI provides \n“[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discriminat ion under any program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.”  42 U.S.C. § 2000d.  Plaintiff alleges  no facts related to his Title VI claim  in his Amended Complaint.   \nTherefore, Plaintiff’s Title VI claim must be dismissed  for failure to state  a claim.  \n8 Rule 15 governs  a plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend where the motion is filed before the deadline to amend \npleadings.   Berge Helene Ltd v. GE Oil & Gas, Inc. , Civil Action No. H -08-2931, 2009 WL 1835193, at *2 ( S.D. Tex. \nJune 26, 2009) .   Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 9 of 12 10 leave to amend is ‘entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court.’ ”  Berge Helene Ltd v. GE \nOil & Gas, Inc., Civil Action No. H -08-2931, 2009 WL 1835193, at *2 (S.D. Tex. J une 26, 2009) \n(quoting Lyn-Lea Travel Corp. v. American Airlines, Inc., 293 F.3d 282, 286 (5th C ir. 2002)).  In \ndeciding whether to grant leave to file an amended complaint, the district court “may consider such \nfactors as undue delay , bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to \ncure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing par ty, and \nfutility of amendment.”   Id. (quoting W imm v. Jack Eckerd Corp. , 3 F.3d 137, 139 (5th Cir. 1993) ).  \n“A motion for leave to amend should be denied as futile if the amended complaint could not \nwithstand a motion to dismiss.”   Id. (citing Goldstein , 340 F.3d at  254).  \nThe Court concludes that Plaintiff ’s proposed Second Amended Complaint  cannot  survive \na motion to dismiss  for the same reas ons the First Amended Complaint  cannot survive a motion to \ndismiss .  Plaintiff’s proposed S econd Amended Complai nt asserts claims for  “race discrimination \nunder [Title VII]; in the syndemic of health disparitie s, disparate  impact, the COVID -19 with \nvariants pandemic, and the 2021 Texas Electric and Water crisis.”   ECF No. 21 at 1.   It also adds \nas defendants the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Governor , and it expands \nthe requested relief .  ECF No. 21- 1.  Plaintiff  makes no specific factual allegations regarding \nDefendant’s COVID -19 response from which the Court could infer a particularized injury in fact \nsufficient to demonstrate Plaintiff’s standing to assert a claim.  Similarly, Plaintiff’s new \nallegations regarding the “2021 Texas Electric and Water crisis”  fail under the same analysis \napplied to his COVID -19 claims : he has failed to allege a particularized injury that would confer \nstanding on him to bring the claims .  Plaintiff  alleges only that “millions of Texans, United States \ncitizens, suffered from mass power outages, water and food shortages, as a result of severe winter \nstorms and State Executive’s negligence in operation of a segregated electrical grid []” and that, a s Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 10 of 12 11 a result,  “[t]he State Executive, breached their duty of improving the health, safety and well -being \nof Texans with good stewardship of public resource s . . . . ”  Id. at 6.   These allegations of \nwrongdoing in connection with the “2021 Electric and Water Crisis” als o fail to allege a \nparticularized injury in fact.  Finally, Plaintiff fails to include in the Second Amended Complaint \nany additional facts which would support a Title  VI or Title  VII claim against Defendant.   \nWhen a plaintiff’s complaint fails to state a  claim, the C ourt generally gives the plaintiff a \nchance to amend the complaint before dismissing the action unless it is clear that doing so  would \nbe futile.  Great Plains Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 313 F.3d 305, 329 (5th \nCir. 2002) .  Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint was filed after  Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss \nand in lieu of a response to Defendant’s Motion. Thus , despite being put on notice of deficiencies \nin his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint fails to correct  those \ndeficiencies .  Under these circumstances, the Court concludes  that Plaintiff has already pled his \n“best case”  and that his claims should be dis missed with prejudice.  See Williams v. Health Tex. \nProvider Network, Civil Case No. 3:16- CV-391-M-BK, 2017 W L 2608813, at *5 (N.D. Tex. June \n1, 2017) (citing Jacquez v. Procunier , 801 F.2d 789, 792 (5th Cir. 1986) ( finding plaintiff pled his \nbest case w here the plaintiff’s amended complaint filed after a  motion to dismiss failed to address \ndeficiencies noted in the defendant’s motion) .  Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint is fatally \nflawed for the same reasons as the First Amended Complaint and therefore,  Plaintiff’s Motion for \nLeave to Amend should be denied as futile.  \nIII.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION \nFor the reasons stated herein , the Court RECOMMENDS  Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss \n(ECF No. 14) be GRANTED and Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend his Amended Complaint  (ECF No.  \n21) be DENIED.  The Clerk of Court shall send copies of the Memorandum and Recommendation Case 4:20-cv-03315   Document 26   Filed on 06/14/21 in TXSD   Page 11 of 12 12 to the respective parties, who will then have fourteen days to file written objections, pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c).

The court partially granted and partially denied Macy's motion to dismiss, dismissing some state law claims but allowing the BIPA and many other claims to proceed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Macy’s violated biometric privacy laws by allegedly using Clearview AI’s database to collect and profit from individuals’ biometric information without consent.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged violations under BIPA, stating Macy's unauthorized use constituted a concrete injury giving the plaintiffs standing. However, some claims under California’s Unfair Competition Law and New York’s common law for unjust enrichment were dismissed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Macy's used secret AI software to look at millions of online photos to find out who was in their store videos. People sued Macy's because they didn't know or agree to let their faces be used like this. The court said the people suing had enough reason to be upset (like their privacy was invaded), so the case can keep going, but some of their other complaints weren’t strong enough to continue.",

(“BIPA”) , along with claims \nunder California  and New York  law.  Before the Court is Macy’s motion to dismiss brought \npursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  For the following reasons,  the \nCourt grants in part and denies in part Macy’s motion.   Specifically, the Court grants Macy’s motion \nas to Count Ten, which alleges a claim under California’s Unfair Competition Law , as well as \nplaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim based on New York com mon law in Count Fifteen.  The Court \ndenies the remainder of Macy’s motion.  \nBackground  \n \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its prior rulings in this multi -district litigation.  In their  \ncomplaint, plaintiffs contend that the Clearview defendants covertly scraped billions of  photographs \nof facial images from the internet and then used artificial intelligence algorithms to scan the face \ngeometry of each individual depicted in the photographs to harvest the individuals’ unique biometric \nidentifiers and corres ponding biometric information.  P laintiffs further assert  that the Clearview \ndefendants created a searchable database containing their biometrics that  allowed users  to identify \nunknown individuals merely by uploading a photograph to the database.  The data base can be \nsearched remotely by licensed users of the Clearview web application.   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 1 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Defendant Macy’s is a private corporation  that purchased access to the  Clearview  database \nand the biometrics contained therein to identify people whose images appeared in surveillance \ncamera footage from Macy’s retail stores.  Plaintiffs  assert  that Macy’s utilized Clearview’s database \nover 6,000 times, each time uploading an image to  the database to  search for a match.  Furthermore, \nplaintiffs contend t hat Macy’s is similarly situated to other database users which comprise the \nClearview Client class:  \nAll non- governmental, private entities – including  publicly -traded companies – who \npurchased access to, or otherwise obtained, the  Biometric Database and then utilized \nthe database to run biometric searches at a  time when the Biometrics of one or more \nof the named Plaintiffs had already been captured, collected or obtained, and \nsubsequentl y stored, by the Clearview  Defendants.  \n \nIn their complaint, plaintiffs bring a BIPA claim against Macy’s under 740 ILCS 14/15(b) , \nwhich prohibits private entities from collectin g, capturing, purchasing, receiving through trade, or \notherwise obtaining a person’s biometric identifiers or information without first providing notice \nand consent.  Similarly, plaintiffs bring a BIPA claim under 7 40 ILCS 14/15(c) , which  prohibit s \nprivate entities from  selling, leasing, trading, or profiting from a person’s biometric identifiers or \ninformation.   Plaintiffs also bring statutory and common law claims against Macy’s  under California  \nand New York law . \nLegal Standard s \nA Rule  12(b)(1) motion challenges federal jurisdiction, and the party invoking jurisdiction \nbears the burden of establishing the elements necessary for subject matter jurisdiction, including \nstanding .  Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc. , 984 F.3d 1241, 1244 ( 7th Cir. 2021) ; International  Union  of \nOperating  Eng’rs v. Daley , 983 F.3d 287, 294 (7th Cir. 2020) .  Under  Rule 12(b)(1), the Court accepts \nthe w ell-pleaded factual allegations as true and construes all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff ’s \nfavor when a defendant has facially attack ed standing .  Prairie Rivers Network v. Dynegy Midwest \nGeneration, LLC , 2 F.4th 1002, 1007 ( 7th Cir. 2021).   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n A motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim tests the \nsufficiency of the complaint, not its merits .  Skinner v. Switzer , 562 U.S. 521, 529, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 \nL.Ed.2d  233 (2011).  When considering dismissal of a complaint, the Court accepts all well -pleaded \nfactual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in fav or of the plaintiff.  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam ).  To survive a motion \nto dismiss, plaintiff must “state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U .S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).  A complaint is facially plausible \nwhen the plaintiff alleges  enough “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”   Ashcroft  v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678, \n129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).  \nDiscu ssion  \nArticle III Standing  \nMacy’s first argues that the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction by challeng ing \nplaintiffs ’ Article III standing to bring their BIPA 15(b) and 15(c)  claims  as alleged in Counts One \nand Three  of the  first amended  consolidated class action complaint .  “Article III of the Constitution \nlimits the federal judicial power to deciding ‘ Cases ’ and ‘ Controversies’” and “as an essential part of \na federal court ’s authority under Article III, [the] standing doctrine ensures respect for these \njurisdictional bounds.”  Prairie Rivers Network, 2 F.4th at 1007.  To establish standing under Article \nIII, a plaintiff must show: (1) he suffered an injury -in-fact; (2) that is fairly traceable to defendant’s \nconduct; and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.   Protect Our Parks, Inc. v. \nChicago Park Dist. , 971 F.3d 722, 729 ( 7th Cir . 2020) (Barrett, J.). \nIn its motion, Macy’s contends  that plaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing because \nthey have failed to sufficiently allege a concrete and particularized injury -in-fact.  To determine \nwhether the disclosure of plaintiffs’ private information without their consent caused a sufficiently Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n concrete harm to support standing , the Court  look s to both history and the judgment of Congress  \nfor guidance.  Gadelhak  v. AT&T Servs.,  Inc., 950 F.3d 458, 462 (7th Cir. 2020) (Bar rett, J.) .  The \nhistorical inquiry asks, “whether the asserted harm has a ‘close relationship’ to a harm traditionally \nrecognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts —such as physical harm, monetary \nharm, or various intangible harms.”  Tran sUnion , LLC v. Ramirez , 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2200 (2021) .  As the \nTransUnion Court explained , “[v]arious intangible harms can also be concrete” including \n“reputational harms, disclosure of private information, and intrusion upon seclusion.” Id.  at 2204.   \nHere, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that defendant’s use of their private information \nwitho ut the opportunity to give their consent  as required  under BIPA 15(b)  caused them the \nconcrete harm of violating their privacy interests in their biometric data.  See Bryant v. Compass Group \nUSA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, 627  (7th Cir. 2020)  (defendants “inflicted the concrete injury BIPA \nintended to protect against,  i.e. a consumer ’s loss of the power and ability to make  informed \ndecisions about the collection, storage, and use of her biometric information.”) .  Therefore, plaintiffs \nhave suf ficiently alleged a concrete injury -in-fact for Article III standing purposes.  \nLikewise, plaintiffs have  sufficiently stated a concrete injury -in-fact under BIPA 15(c)  by \nalleging that Macy’s profited  from  using the Clearview database to prevent losses and improve \ncustomer experience , and, that as a result of Macy’s use, plaintiffs’ biometric information was  \ncompromised.   Contrary to Macy’s argument that it merely uploaded photographs onto the \nClearview dat abase, plaintiffs allege that Macy’s purchased, obtained, accessed, and used the \nbiometrics in the database and profited from that conduct.  Meanwhile , Macy’s reliance on the \nSeventh Circuit’s decision in Thornley  is misplaced because in that matter , the plaintiffs purposely  \navoided federal court jurisdiction by bringing bare BIPA 15(c) claims alleging that they were not \ninjured as a result of any BIPA violations .  See Thornley , 984 F.3d at 1246; Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc. , \nNo. 20- cv-3843, 2020 WL 6262356, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2020) (Coleman, J.) (“ Plaintiffs Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n purposely narrowed their claim to the general prohibition of Clearview selling and profit ing from \nplaintiffs’ biometric data and filed their lawsuit in state court where such actions are allowed without \nthe constraints of Article III  standing .”); see also Rosenbach  v. Six Flags  Enter.  Corp.,  129 N.E.3d 1197, \n1207, 432 Ill.Dec. 654, 664 (Ill. 2019) (“an individual need not allege some actual injury or adverse \neffect, beyond violation of his or her rights under the Act, in order to qualify as an ‘aggrieved’ \nperson.”).   Such is not the  case here . \nThe Court turns to the other factors of Article III standing, namely, that the injuries alleged \nare fa irly traceable to Macy’s conduct  and that the injur ies are likely to be redressed by a favorable \njudicial decision .  In its motion, Macy’s argues that the  relief plaintiffs seek has no bearing on their \nneed to protect their biometric information because Macy’s does not “possess” this information.  \nViewing the allegations in plaintiffs’ favor, they have alleged that Macy’s has done more than merely \npossess their photos, including  that Macy’s used the Clearview database to obtain the biometrics of \nmillions of Illinois residents for comparing the data against the photographs Macy’s uploaded.  With \nthese allegations in mind, Macy’s cannot point the fing er at the Clearview defendants and then \nignore its own conduct in using the Clearview database.  Moreover, “ the prospect of statutory \ndamages shows that such an injury is r edressable .”  Bryant , 958 F.3d at 621.  Macy’s Article III \nstanding argument fails.  \nRule 12(b)(6) Challenges to BIPA Claims  \n \nMacy’s  challenges plaintiffs’ BIPA claims under Rule 12(b)(6) arguing plaintiffs have failed to \nadequately allege these claims under the federal pleading standards per  Iqbal  and Twombly .  First, \nMacy’s argues  plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege their BIPA 15(b) claim because they do not \nallege the who, what, where, when, or how of this claim.  From Macy’s argument, i t appears Macy’s \nis arguing that plaintiffs must fulfill the heightened pleading standard under Rule 9(b), see Mamalakis \nv. Anesthetix M gmt. LLC , 20 F.4th 295, 301 ( 7th Cir. 2021), which is simply not the case.  Meanwhile , Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n the basis of plaintiffs’ BIPA 15( b) claim is that Macy’s accessed and obtained plaintiffs’ biometric \ninformation without plaintiffs’ knowledge and consent each time Macy’s sought to identify an \nindividual by uploading photos to the Clearview database.  In other words, Macy’s actively purchased access to obtain plaintiffs’ biometrics without comply ing with BIPA 15(b)’s notice and \nconsent requirements.  Cothron v. White Castle Sys ., Inc., 20 F.4th 1156, 1159 ( 7th Cir. 2021)  \n(“Section  15(b) provides that a private entity may not ‘ collect, capture, purchase, receive through \ntrade, or otherwise obtain’  a person’ s biometric data without first providing  notice  to and \nreceiving  consent  from the person. ”).  Thus, plaintiffs have plausibly alleged their BIPA 15(b) \nviolation against Macy’s.   \nMacy’s also takes issue with plaintiffs’ BIPA 15(c) allegations arguing that  plaintiffs have not \nalleged M acy’s possesse d their biometric information and that plaintiffs did not provide sufficient \nfactual details that Macy’s profited from this information.  Despite these arguments, plaintiffs have adequately alleged t hat Macy’s obtained access to their biometric information and searched  the \nClearview database resulting in Macy’s o btain ing, access ing, and us ing the biometrics in the database.  \nPlaintiffs also allege that Macy’s used this information for their own business purposes  and profited \nfrom its use.  From plaintiffs’ allegations, it is reasonable to infer that plaintiffs’ biometric information was necessary to Macy’s loss prevention business model  and that th is biometric \ninformation generated profits by reducing the number of stolen goods.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ have \nplausibly alleged their BIPA 15(c) claim against Macy’s.  \nCalifor nia State Law Claim s \n In Count s Ten through Thirteen, plaintiff Andrea Vestrand,  on behalf of herself and others \nsimilarly situated in the California Subclass , brings claims under California statutory and common \nlaw.  In Count Ten, Vestrand alleges that Macy’s violated  California’s Unfair Competition Law \n(“UCL”).  To bring a claim under the UCL, a plaintiff  must “(1) establish a loss or deprivation of Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n money or property sufficient to quantify as injury in fact, i.e.,  economic  injury , and (2) show that  the \neconomic injury was the result of, i.e., caused  by, the unfair business practice.”  Kwikset  Corp.  v. Superior  \nCourt , 51 Cal . 4th 310, 322, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877 ( Cal. 2011) (emphasis in original) .  \nMacy’s maintains  that plaintiffs’ UCL claim necessarily fails because personal information is \nnot “property” for purposes of the UCL .  See In re Facebook Privacy Litig. , 791 F.Supp.2d 705, 714 \n(N.D. Cal. 2011) .  The Court agrees.  In deed, “[n]umerous courts have held that disclosure  of \npersonal information alone does not constitute economic or  property  loss sufficient to \nestablish  UCL  standing, unless the plaintiff provides specific allegations regarding the value of the \ninformation. ”  Mastel v. Miniclip SA , ___ F.Supp.3d  ___, 2021 WL 2983198, at *11 (E.D. Cal. 2021) .   \nMoreover, Macy’s contends  plaintiffs’ UCL claim does not survive the present motion to \ndismiss because plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege an unfair business practice for purposes of \nthe UCL.   The UCL “governs ‘ anti-competitive  business practices’ as well as injuries to consumers, \nand has as a major purpose ‘the preservation of fair business competition.’”  Chu v. Old Republic Home \nProtection C o., Inc., 274 Cal.Rptr.3d 528, 536, 60 Cal.App.5th 346, 357 (Cal. 2021).  In short, the  \n“UCL ’s purpose is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in \ncommercial markets for goods and services.”   Erhart v. BofI Holding , Inc.,  387 F.Supp.3d 1046, 1059 \n(S.D.  Cal. 201 9) (citation omitted).  Plaintiffs’ allegations do not involve the protection of fair \ncompetition in commercial markets , therefore , the Court  dismisses plaintiffs’ UCL claim without \nleave t o amend because any such amendment would be futile.  \nIn Count Eleven, Vestrand alleges a commercial misappropriation of likeness claim against \nMacy’s  under California Civil Code § 3344(a) , as well as a common law right to publicity claim in \nCount Twelve.   The Court analyzes Counts Eleven and Twelve together because t o state a claim \nunder § 3 344(a), a plaintiff  must first fulfill the elements of the common law  right to publicity .  See \nDowning  v. Abercrombie &  Fitch,  265 F.3d 994, 1001 (9th Cir. 2001) ; Cross v. Facebook, Inc.,  222 Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n Cal.Rptr.3d 250, 265, 14 Cal.App.5th 190, 208 (Cal. 2017) (“ Civil Code section  3344 was intended to \ncomplement , not supplant,  common  law claims for right of publicity.”).  \nThe California common law “right of publicity seeks to prevent commercial exploitation of \nan individual ’s identity without that person’ s consent. ”  Maloney v. T3Media, Inc ., 853 F.3d 1004, 1010 \n(9th Cir. 2017) .  The elements of a common law right to privacy claim include : (1) defendant ’s \nunauthorized use of the plaintiff ’s identity; (2) the appropriation of plaintiff ’s name or likeness to \ndefendant ’s advantage , commercial or otherwise; and ( 3) the resulting injury.   Downing, 265 F.3d at \n1001; Ross v. Roberts , 166 Cal.Rptr.3d 359, 365, 222 Cal.App.4th 677, 684 (Cal. 2013).   \nMacy’s contends that Vestrand’s common law claim must fail because she did not allege she \nhas a commercial interest or value in her likeness.  Vestrand, however, is not required to plead f acts \ncorresponding to each legal element of her claim to survive a motion to dismiss, but instead, need \nonly allege a plausible claim.  Chapman  v. Yellow  Cab Cooperative , 875 F.3d  846, 848 (7th  Cir. 2017) .  \nVestrand has done so by alleging that Macy’s used her photographs and likeness without \nauthorization for commercial gai n via Macy’s loss prevention business model.  Further, Vestrand \nalleges the California Subclass was injured because Macy’s did not compensate them for its  use of \ntheir likeness es, identifies, and photographs.  These allegations plausibly state a common law right to \npublicity claim under California law.  \nNext, under Cal ifornia’s statutory remedy, § 3344,  plaintiffs must also show  “a knowing use \nby the defendant as well as a direct connection between the alleged use and the commercial \npurpose.”  Downing , 265 F.3d at 1001.  In its motion, Macy’s maintains that §  3344 requires plaintiffs \nto allege that its use of the Clearview database was  for purposes of advertising, selling, or soliciting.  \nMacy’s, however, ignores parts of § 3344(a), which states , “[a]ny person who knowingly uses \nanother ’s name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness in any manne r, on or in products, \nmerchandise, or goods, or for purposes of advertising or selling, or  soliciting purchases of, products, Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n merchandise, goods or services, without such person’ s prior consent, or, in the case of a minor, the \nprior consent of his parent or legal guardian, shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person \nor persons injured as a result thereof. ” (emphasis added).   Therefore,  under §  3344, plaintiffs need \nnot allege that Macy’s used their photos or likenesses for purposes of advertising, selling, or \nsoliciting.  And , as discussed, plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Macy’s knowingly used their \nphotos by accessing the Clearview database to achieve Macy’s loss prevention goals.  The Court \ndenies Macy’s motion to dismiss Counts Eleven and Twelve.  \nIn Count Thirteen, Vestrand alleges that Macy’s violated her right to privacy under the \nCalifornia Constitution.   To establish a claim for invasion of privacy under the California \nConstitution,  a plaintiff must eventually show (1) she  possess es a legally protected privacy interest , \n(2) she maintain s a reasonable expectation of privacy , and (3) defendant’s conduct constituted a \nserious invasion of privacy.  Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 865 P.2d 633, 654- 55, 26 \nCal.Rptr.2d 834, 7 Cal.4th 1 ( Cal. 1994) .  Here, Macy’s asserts plaintiffs failed to adequately allege \nthat Vestrand possessed a legally protected privacy interest.   The California Constitution protects \ntwo separate classes of privacy interests:  (1) information privacy, which includes interests in \nprecl uding the dissemination or misuse of confidential and sensitive information; and (2) autonomy \nprivacy, including interests in making personal decisions or conducting personal activities without \nintrusion.  In re Google Location History Litig ., 514 F.Supp.3d 1147, 1154 (N.D. Cal. 2021)  (citing  Hill, \n865 P.2d at 654) .  Because autonomy privacy protects bodily autonomy, it does not apply under the \ncircumstances.  Se e In re Yahoo Mail Litig ., 7 F.Supp.3d 1016, 1039 (N.D. Cal. 2014) .  The Court thus \nexamines whether plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the first class of privacy interests, information \nprivacy.   \nConstruing  the allegations in plaintiffs’ favor, they have adequately  stated  that Macy’s  \nconduct constituted a serious invasion of their  information privacy .  Plaintiffs allege that Macy’s Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n purchased access to the Clearview database containing their biometric identifiers.  Biometric \ninformation, by its very nature, is sensitive and confidential.  See Fox v. Dakkota Integrated Sys., LLC , \n980 F.3d 1146, 1155 ( 7th Cir. 2020) (“ biometric identifiers … are immutable, and once \ncompromised, are compromised forever.”) .  Macy’s then accessed, used, and obtained the California \nSubclass members’ confidential and sensitive biometrics.  In addition, plaintiffs allege that the \nCalifornia Subclass had a reasonable expectation of privacy to their highly sensitive biometrics.  \nVestrand has therefore plausibly alleged her right to privacy claim under the California Constitution.   \nNew York Sta te Law Claim  \nIn Count Fourteen, plaintiff Aaron Hurvitz, on behalf of himself and others similarly \nsituated in the New York Subclass, brings  a claim under New York’s Civil Rights Act  § 51.  The \npurpose of § 51 is to protect individuals from the commercial exploitation of their name or image.  \nSee Kuklachev v. Gelfman , 600 F.Supp.2d 437, 474- 75 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) .  To establish liability under  § \n51, a plaintiff must show defendant’s nonconsensual use his name, portrait, picture, or voice within \nthe state of New York for purposes of advertising or trade.  See Electra v. 59 Murray Enter ., Inc., 987 \nF.3d 233, 249 ( 2d Cir. 2021) .    \nWithout citing legal authority, Macy’s first argument is that plaintiffs’ §  51 claim must fail \nbecause they have not alleged that Macy’s took Hurvitz’s picture or the picture of any other \nparticular person.  The plain language of the statut e, however, states that it is the nonconsensual \n“use” of a picture that is prohibited.  See  N.Y. Civil Rights L. § 51; see also Electra,  987 F.3d at 249.   \nMacy’s also argues that its use of plaintiff’s picture was not for trade purposes.  New York \n“courts have defined use ‘ for the purposes of trade ’ as use which ‘ would draw trade to the firm ’ or \n‘use for the purpose of making profit. ’”  Amusement Indus ., Inc. v. Stern , 693 F.Supp.2d 301, 314 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2 010) (citation omitted).  As discussed above, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged plaintiffs’ \nbiometric information was necessary to Macy’s loss prevention business model and that this Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n biometric information generat ed profits by reducing the number of stolen goods.  Plaintiffs ’ \nallegations have raised their  right to relief above a speculative level , and thus, t he Court denies \nMacy’s motion in this respect.   \nUnjust Enrichment Claim  \nLast, Macy’s moves to dismiss plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim alleged in Count Fifteen of \nthe first amended consolidated class action complaint .  In particular, Macy’s asserts that unjust \nenrichment is not a viable, stand- alone claim under Illinois, California, or New York law.  Under \nIllinois law, unjust enrichment “ is not a separate cause of action that, standing alone, would justify \nan action for recovery.”   Toushin v. Ruggiero , 2021 IL App (1st) 192171, ¶ 80, 2021 WL 2718495, at \n*13 ( 1st Dist.  2021) (quoting  Mulligan v. QVC, Inc., 888 N.E.2d 1190, 1200, 321 Ill.Dec. 257, 267, 382 \nIll.App.3d 620, 631 ( 1st Dist.  2008) .  Rather, unjust enrichment is a condition resulting from \nunlawful or improper conduct like fraud and may be redressed by a cause of action based upon that \nimproper conduct.  Toushin , 2021 IL App (1st) 192171, ¶ 80.   “[I]f an unjust enrichment claim  rests \non the same improper conduct alleged in another claim, then the unjust enrichment claim will be \ntied to this related claim —and, of course, unjust enrichment will stand or  fall with the related claim .”  \nCleary v. Philip Morris Inc ., 656 F.3d 511, 517 ( 7th Cir. 2011) .  Because plaintiffs have sufficiently \nalleged their BIPA claims, the Court denies Macy’s motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim \nattendant to the BIPA claims  at this juncture . \nThe Ninth Circuit has explained that a  California common law unjust enrichment claim may \nsurvive either “as an independent cause of action or as a quasi -contract claim for restitution.”    ESG \nCapital Partners, LP v.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves Citizens Insurance Company of America, which sought a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated under its policy to defend Wynndalco Enterprises in two class-action lawsuits. These lawsuits filed against Wynndalco alleged violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to the sale of access to an AI-based facial recognition database created by Clearview AI. The court concluded that the language in the insurance policy was ambiguous regarding exclusions for statutory violations, thereby obligating Citizens to defend Wynndalco in the lawsuits.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the statutory exclusion clause in the insurance policy issued by Citizens Insurance precludes coverage for defense against BIPA violation claims.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the statutory violation exclusion in the insurance policy was ambiguous with regards to BIPA violations, and ambiguities in insurance policies should be construed in favor of the insured. Therefore, Citizens must defend Wynndalco against the lawsuits.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have an insurance policy that promises to help you if you get into certain types of trouble. You get sued because someone says you broke a law about how you use pictures of people’s faces. Your insurance company doesn't want to help because they think the insurance policy doesn't cover this type of problem. The judge looks at the policy and says, \"Hey, the words are confusing and could mean different things.\" The judge decides that if it's unclear, the insurance company has to help you out. So, they have to back you up in court, even if they're not happy about it.",

Because the policy exclusion invoked by Citize ns does not unambiguously \npreclude coverage for the underlying lawsuits, Citizens’  motion is denied, and \nWynndalco ’s cross -motion is grant ed.  \nI. Undisputed Facts  \nA. The Thornley  and Calderon  Lawsuits  \nThe litigation that prompted this insurance coverage dispute involves the \nsecret collection of more than three billion facial scans by Clearview AI, an artificial \nintelligence company that specializes in facial recognition software .  See 1st Am. \nCompl. (“Compl.”) ¶ 19, ECF No. 20 .  Clearview AI allegedly extracted, or “scraped ,” \nphotographs from social media and content sharing platforms like Facebook, Twitter, \nInstagram, You Tube, and Venmo to create a database of facial scans (“Clearview \nDatabase”).  Id.  Clearview AI  also created a facial recognition application (“Clearview \nApp”) that allows its customers  to identify individuals by comparing facial pictures \nthey take to the Clearview Database.  Id.  Wynndalco, an information technology \n(“IT”) services and consulting firm, licensed and sold access to the Clearview \nDatabase and Clearview App to customers in Illinois.  Id. ¶¶ 21–22.  \nMelissa Thornley and Mario Calderon , on behalf of themselves and others \nsimilarly situated,  each filed class action lawsuits  (the “ Thornley  Lawsuit” and the \n“Calderon  Lawsuit ;” together , the “Lawsuits” ) against Wynndalco, alleging that Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 2 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n Wynndalco had violated BIPA —an Illinois statute that regulates the collection, \ndisclosure, retention, and destruction of biometric infor mation,  by selling Clearview’s \nproducts in Illinois .  Id. ¶¶ 18, 28; see Compl. Ex. B, Class Action Compl., Thornley v. \nCDW -Gov’t, LLC , No. 2020 CH 04346 (Cir. Ct. Cook Cnty. May 27, 2020) , ECF No. \n20-2; Compl. Ex. C , 1st Am.

The Citizens Policy  \nWynndalco purchased a  Business  Owners Insurance P olicy from Citizens  and \nhas asked Citizen s to defend it and its officers pursuant to the policy .  Compl. ¶  34; \nsee Compl. Ex. A, Business Owners Policy No. OBC -H062078 -00 (the “Policy”), ECF \nNo. 20-1.  The Policy provides coverage for “personal and advertising injury ,” defined, \nin pertinent part, as “injury, including consequential ‘bodily injury,’ arising out of  . . \n. [o]ral or written publication, in any manner, of material that violates a person’s \nright of privacy.”   Id.  \nThe Policy also contains a number of exclusions.  Relevant here is the exclus ion \nentitled “Distribution of Material in Violation of Statutes ” (“Statutory Violation \nexclusion”),  which provides that the insurance does not apply to : \n“[P]ersonal and advertising injury” arising directly  or \nindirectly out of any action or omission that  violates or is \nalleged to violate : \n \n(1)   The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)   \n     [47 U.S.C. § 227 et seq. ] including any amendment  \n     of or addition to such law;  or \n \n \n1  The Thornley  Lawsuit also includes common law claims for invasion of privacy and \nunjust enrichment.

This dispute concerns the interpretation of the last \nsubsection of this exclusion . \nII. Legal Standard  \n Motions for judgment on the pleadings are brought under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(c)¸ which tests the sufficiency of claims based on the pl eadings.  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12 (c); see Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Columbia Ins. Grp., Inc. , 972 F.3d 915, 919 (7th \nCir. 2020).  A party may move for judgment on the pleadings after the pleadings are \nclosed.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).  \nWhen reviewing a Rule 12(c) motion, the Court takes all facts pleaded in the \ncomplaint as true and draws “all reasonable inferences and facts in favor of  the \nnonmovant.”  Wagner v. Teva Pharm. USA, Inc. , 840 F.3d 355, 358 (7th Cir. 2016).  \nThe Court will grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings if “ it appears beyond \ndoubt that the nonmovant cannot prove facts sufficient to support its position, and \nthat the plaintiff is entitled to relief .”  Scottsdale  Ins., 972 F.3d at 919.  \n Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 4 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n III. Analysis  \nAs a preliminary matter, the parties agree that Illinois law applies.   Compare , \ne.g., Citizens’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. J. Pleadings at 8 (“Citizens’ Mem.”), ECF No. 65, \nwith, e.g., Mem. Law Supp. Wynndalco & Thornley Defs.’ Mots. J. Pleadings & Opp’n \nCitizens’ Mot. J. Pleadings at 9, ECF No. 86.   Furthermore, all material facts are \nundisputed , and Citizen s does not contest that, if it has a duty to defend Wynndalco, \nit also must d efend its officers .  With that , the Court turns to the question at hand, \nnamely, whether the policy Citizen s issued to Wynndalco provides coverage for the \ndefense of the Lawsuits.   See Mashallah, Inc. v. W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co. , 20 F.4th 311, \n319 (7th Cir. 2 021) (“Under Illinois law, the interpretation of an insurance policy, like \nany other contract, is a question of law. ”). \nTo answer this question, the Court must look to the language of the insurance \npolicy.  “ The goal in interpreting an insurance policy is to ascertain and give effect to \nthe intention of the parties, as expressed in the policy language.”   Scottsdale  Ins., 972 \nF.3d at 919 (cleaned up).  Furthermore, under Illinois law, “ insurance policies are to \nbe liberally construed in favor of coverage, and where an ambiguity exists in the \ninsurance contract, it will be resolved in favor of the insured and against the insurer. ”  \nUnited Servs. Auto. Ass ’n v. Dare , 830 N.E.2d 670, 678 ( Ill. App. Ct. 2005) .  At the \nsame time, policy language is not  ambiguous “ simply because the parties disagree as \nto its meaning [,]” and the court should not “strain to find an ambiguity where none \nexists.”  Founders Ins. Co. v. Munoz , 930 N.E.2d 999, 1004 ( Ill. 2010) .   Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 5 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n When seeking coverage, “[a] n insured has the bu rden of proving that a claim \nfalls within the coverage of the policy.  . . . Once the insured satisfies this burden, the \ninsurer has the burden of proving that the loss was limited or excluded by a contract \nprovision. ”  Travelers Pers. Ins. Co. v. Edwards , 48 N.E.3d 298, 303  (Ill. App. Ct. \n2016).  What is more, “[a]n insurer can only refuse to defend if the allegations of the \nunderlying complaint preclude any possibility of coverage.”  Ill. Tool Works, Inc. v. \nTravelers Cas. & Sur. Co. , 26 N.E.3d 421, 428 (I ll. App. Ct. 2015).   But a single \nunequivocal exclusion is sufficient to show that an insurer does not have a duty to \ndefend the insured.  See, e.g. , Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Dental USA, Inc. , No. 13 C \n7637, 2014 WL 2863164, at *4 (N.D. Ill. June 24, 2014)  (applying Illinois law) .   \nFinally, to “ determine whether the insurer ’s duty to defend has arisen, the \ncourt must compare the allegations of the underlying complaint to the policy \nlanguage. ”  Id.  “If the court determines that these allegations fall within, or \npotentially within , the policy ’s coverage, the insurer has a duty to defend the insured \nagainst the underlying complaint. ”  Metzger v. Country Mut. Ins. Co. , 986 N.E.2d 756, \n761 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013) ( cleaned up ).   \nIn this case, the dispute focuses on  whether the Statutory Violation exclusion \npreclude s coverage for the Lawsuits .  The Court begins with the language of the \nexclusion .  As noted above , the Statutory Violation exclusion  disavows  coverage for :  \n[P]ersonal and advertising injury  . . . arising directly or \nindirectly out of any action or omission that violates or is \nalleged to violate  . . . [the TCPA, CAN -SPAM, FCRA, or \nFACTA]  [or a] ny other laws, statutes[,] ordinances [,] or     \nregulations that address, prohibit or  limit the pri nting, \ndissemination, disposal, collecting, recording, sending,  Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 6 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n transmitting, communicating or distribution of material or \ninformation . \n \nPolicy at 92.  Citizens argues, as an initial matter, that this language is not \nambiguous  because BIPA is a “statute” t hat regulates the “ dissemination, disposal, \ncollecting, recording, sending,  transmitting, communicating or distribution of \nmaterial or information .”  Id.  But t he Supreme Court of Illinois  recently  held that a \nnearly identical provision was ambiguous .  W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Krishna \nSchaumburg Tan, Inc. , ___ N.E.3d ____, 2021 WL 2005464, at * 10 (Ill. May 20, 2021) .  \nAs an authoritative construction of Illinois law  by the state’s highest court ,  Krishna ’s \nholding  is binding on this Court unl ess it can be distinguished.  See Kaiser v. Johnson \n& Johnson , 947 F.3d 996, 1013 (7th Cir. 2020).   Citizens’  attempt to do so is not \npersuasive.  \nFirst, Citizens  points out that the  exclusion in  Krishna  had a more specific \ntitle: “Violation of Statutes tha t Govern E -Mails, Fax, Phone Calls or Other Methods \nof Sending Material or Information.”  Citizens ’ Mem. at  11.  Because the Supreme \nCourt of Illinois began the Krishna  analysis with the title of the exclusion, see 2021 \nWL 2005464, at *10, Citizens argues , the case is inapposite.  \nAt the outset, this Court is not convinced that the difference in the titles makes \nthese exclusions substantively different.  See, e.g., First Mercury Ins. Co. v. Triple \nLocation LLC , 536 F.  Supp. 3d 326, 331 –32 (N.D. Ill. 2021)  (referring to the exclusion \nat issue in Krishna  as “materially identical ” to one with the title “Distribution of \nMaterial in Violation of Statutes,” and otherwise identical substance).  But even if \nthe change in title  were  material , Citizens’ argument s would still fail .   Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 7 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n In a literal sense, it is true that BIPA, like the other enumerated statutes, \n“regulates the dissemination, disposal, collecting, recording, sending, transmitting, \ncommunicating or distribution of  . . . information .”  Citizens’ Reply at 6.  But as \nWynndalco observes, reading the exclusion in this way would swallow the rule.  Most \nstatutes “regulate . . . information” to some degree.  To interpret the exclusion to cover \nevery statute that concerns a person or entity doing practically anything whatsoever \nwith “information” would make certain coverage  provisions illusory, including, for \nexample, those that provide coverage for injuries “ arising out of  . . . [o] ral or written \npublication, in any manner, of material that violates a person’s right of privacy.”  \nPolicy at 100.  \nOther provisions of the Policy also belie Citizens’ expansive reading.  See \nFounders  Ins., 930 N.E.2d at 1004 (courts must interpret provisions in light of the \nentire policy).  The Policy explicitly covers slander and libel claims, false advertising \nclaims, and claims for copyright infringement.  See Policy at 100.  These claims also \narise under statutes —such as  the Illinois Slander and Libel Act,  740 I ll. Co mp. Stat. \n145/0.01 et seq ., the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1051 et seq. , and the Copyright Act, 17 \nU.S.C. § 101 et seq. —that “regulate the dissemination . . . or distribution of material \nor information.”  Compl. ¶ 17; see, e.g. , 17 U.S.C. § 106(3) (protecting  the copyright \nowner’s right “ to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the \npublic ”).  Under Citizens’ construction, the Statutory Violation exclusion would bar \ncoverage for violations of the very statutes under which slander, libel, false Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 8 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n advertising, and copyright claims arise.  The Court refuses to adopt such a \nnonsensical reading of the Policy . \nBecause the language of the exclusion is ambiguous  on its face , the Court \nturns, as did  the Supreme Court  of Illinois  in Krishna , to canons  of statutory \nconstruction for guidance .  Unfortunately, these are of limited utility here.   Krishna  \nemployed ejusdem generis , which counsels that, “w here general words follow specific \nwords . . . the general words are [usually] construed to embrace only objects similar \nin nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words. ”  Yates v. \nUnited States , 574 U.S. 528, 545 (2015) (quoting Wash . State Dep’t of Soc. and Health \nServs. v. Gua rdianship Estate of Keffeler , 537 U.S. 371, 384 (2003)  (first alteration \nomitted )); see 2021 WL 2005464, at *10 .  The policy in Krishna  listed only the TCPA , \nthe CAN -SPAM  Act, and the catchall .  2021 WL 2005464, at *10 .  Accordingly, the \nKrishna  court found that BIPA did not fall within the catchall  because, unlike the \nTCPA and the CAN -SPAM Act, BIPA does not regulate “methods of communication.”  \nSee id.  \nIn this case, however, the exclusion also includes FCRA  and FACTA .  Neither \nof these statutes  are directed towards regulating methods of communication.  FCRA \nregulates the credit reporting industry with a purpose “to promote ‘fair and accurate \ncredit reporting ’ and to protect consumer privacy .” TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , ___ \nU.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 2 190, 2200 (2021) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1681(a)).   And FACTA  is \nan amendment to FCRA  that imposes restrictions on the disclosure of credit and debit \naccount information, enacted in response to a perceived increase in identity theft.  Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 9 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n Meyers v. Oneida Tribe o f Indians of Wis. , 836 F.3d 818, 819 –20 (7th Cir. 2016) , cert. \ndenied , 137 S. Ct. 1331 (2017).   Thus, the interpretive tool of ejusdem generis  is \nunhelpful in this case, because ejusdem generis  requires the general term to share a \ncharacteristic that is common to all the specific terms.  See  Saxon v. Sw. Airlines Co. , \n993 F.3d 492, 496 (7th Cir. 2021).2 \nBut, even if the Court were to apply ejusdem generis  here, the result is not \nwhat Citizens advocates.  According to Citizen s, the application of ejusdem generis  \nshows that BIPA is “like” the TCPA,  CAN -SPAM  Act, FCRA, and FACTA because \n“[those statutes] all protect privacy interests generally, and BIPA and the \nFCRA/FACTA more specifically protect against identity theft. ”  Citizens’ Reply Supp. \nMot. J. Pleadings Resp. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. J. Pleadings at 6  (“Citizens’ Reply”) , ECF \nNo. 88.   \nFor one thing, Citizens’ proposed commonalities do not even link the four listed \nstatutes.   The parallel Citizens attempts to draw between FCRA/FACTA and BIPA —\nthat each statute protects against the disclosure of personal information —does not \napply to the TCPA or the CAN -SPAM  Act, which do not regulate the collection or \n \n2  It bears mentioning that, while Krishna ’s substantive holding that the Statutory \nViolation exclusion is ambiguous is binding on this Court, its  application of ejusdem generis  \nis not.  See Cabeda v. At t’y Gen ., 971 F.3d 165, 171 n.4 (3d Cir. 2020) (“[S]hifting interpretive \nmethodologies are not usually viewed as carrying the force of stare decisis .”); Abbe R. Gluck, \nThe States as Laboratories of Statutory Interpretation: Methodological Consensus and the \nNew Modi fied Textualism , 119 YALE L.J. 1750, 1765 (2010) ( noting that “the [U.S. Supreme] \nCourt does not give stare decisis effect to any statements of statutory interpretation \nmethodology.  The interpretive rule used in one case  . . . is not viewed as ‘law’ for the next \ncase. ” (citation omitted)) .  And even if Krishna mandated applying ejusdem generis in the \ncontext of an exclusion containing only the TCPA and the CAN -SPAM Act, the exclusion in \nthe instant Policy is di stinguishable because it includes  FCRA and FACTA .  See Blount v. \nStroud , 904 N.E.2d 1, 15 (Ill. 2009) (“[T] he precedential scope of our decision is limited to the \nfacts that were before us .”). Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 10 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n dissemination of personal i nformation.  See generally 15 U.S.C. § 7701  et seq. ; 47 \nU.S.C. § 227  et seq.   And even if the Court were to entertain Citizens’ broader \nargument that all five statutes protect “privacy ” in a generalized sense, they still are \nnot sufficiently similar to justify reading  the exclusion’s catchall to cover  BIPA.  The \nTCPA and the CAN -SPAM  Act protect “privacy”  by regulating  unauthorized  \ncommunications  that private citizens receive  (e.g., telemarketing calls and spam \nemails) .  By contr ast, FCRA, FACTA, and BIPA protect “privacy” in a different sense , \nby regulating how private entities must handle private information that citizens give \naway  (e.g., credit card numbers and facial scans) .  This distinction tracks closely to \nthe different de finitions of “privacy,” a term that can mean both “freedom from \nunauthorized intrusion,” and “secrecy” or “a private matter.”   Privacy , MERRIAM -\nWEBSTER .COM, https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/privacy  (last visited \nFeb. 26, 202 2); see Am. States Ins. Co. v. Cap. Assocs. of Jackson Cnty. , Inc., 392 F.3d \n939, 941 –43 (7th Cir. 200 4) (instructing lower courts to “ distinguish secrecy from \nseclusion, [and]  to appreciate that [drafters of statutes and insurance policies] may \nuse the word  ‘privacy ’ in different ways ”).  Because the type of “privacy” that BIPA \nprotects is dissimilar to the type of privacy that  the TCPA and the CAN -SPAM Act \nregulate,  ejusdem generis  does not do the work that Citizen s would have it do.  See \nAmerican  States , 392 F.3d at  941–43 (holding that an exclusion covering advertising \ninjury did not cover the TCPA because the TCPA protects “privacy” in the sense of \nseclusion, while adverti sing injury impinges on “privacy” in the sense of secrecy );  \nEvanston  Ins. Co. v. Gene by Gene, Ltd ., 155 F. Supp. 3d 706, 713 (S.D. Tex. 2016)  Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 11 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n (finding that  the TCPA and  the CAN -SPAM Act were not like statute regulating \ndisclosure of genetic information ). \nTo support its ejusdem generis argument, Citizens points to Massachusetts Bay \nInsurance Co. v. Impact Fulfillment Services, LLC , No. 1:20CV926, 2021 WL 4392061 \n(M.D.N.C. Sept. 24, 2021).3  That case applied ejusdem generis to hold that BIPA fell \nwithin a nearly identical exclusion,  which listed the  TCPA, the CAN -SPAM  Act, \nFCRA, and FACTA as specific examples followed by a catchall term.  See id. at *3 , 7.  \nBut the Massachusetts Bay court did not grapple with the distinction between the two \ntypes  of privacy  that are implicated in the enumerated statutes —privacy of personal \ninformation (as concerns FCRA and FACTA), versus  privacy from unwanted \ncommunications (as concern s the TCPA and the CAN -SPAM  Act).  In this way, \nMassachusetts Bay does not square with the  Seventh Circuit’s admonition in \nAmerican States  that a court  interpreting an insurance policy  must not “say . . . that \n[a statute] protects privacy,  and then stop the analysis ” without considering whether \nthe stat ute in question covers the same type of privacy interest as the policy is meant \nto cover .  392 F.3d at 942.  Thus, the Court respectfully disagrees with the holding in \nMassachusetts Bay .  \n \n3  Citizens cites numerous other cases holding that various other statutes fell within \nsimilar e xclusions because they protect privacy.  See OneBeacon Am. Ins. Co. v. Urb. \nOutfitters, Inc. , 21 F. Supp. 3d 426, 440 (E.D. Pa. 2014), aff’d, 625 F. App’x 177 (3d Cir. 2015); \nBig 5 Sporting Goods Corp. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co. , 957 F. Supp. 2d 1135, 1149 –50 (C.D. Cal. \n2013), aff’d, 635 F. App’x 351 (9th Cir. 2015);  Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Greve , No. 3:17CV183 -\nGCM, 2017 WL 5557669, at *4 –5 (W.D.N.C. Nov. 17, 2017), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. \nHartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Ted A. Greve & Assocs. , 742 F. App' x 738 (4th Cir. 2018).   The Court \nfinds these cases unpersuasive , however, because they do not conside r this particular \nexclusion with reference to the distinction between “privacy” as seclusion and “privacy” as \nsecrec y.  See 21 F. Supp. 3d at 440; 957 F. Supp. 2d at 1150; 2017 WL 5557669, at *4 –5.  Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 12 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n Nor does the noscitur a sociis canon  (a broader relative of ejusdem generis ) add \nclarity .  That rule provides  that “ a word is known by the company it keeps ,” or, in \nother words, an ambiguous term should be read to mean something similar to the \nwords that surround it.  Yates , 574 U.S. at 543.  The only discernible resemblance \nbetween the TCPA, the CAN -SPAM Act, FCRA, and FACTA is that they all protect \n“privac y.”  But once more, “privacy” in the BIPA context means something much \ndifferent than  “privacy” in the TCPA context , so the similarity is superficial at best .  \n“[W]ithout  a common feature to extrapolate”  onto the ambiguous term,  noscitur a \nsociis  “is no he lp.”  S.D. Warren Co. v. Me. Bd. of Envt’l Prot. , 547 U.S. 370, 379 –80 \n(2006). \nWith neither the plain text nor these canons of construction pointing to a clear \nmeaning, t he Court concludes that the Statutory Violation exclusion is intractably \nambiguous.  Thus, Citizens  has not met its burden to “affirmatively establish” that \nthe exclusion applies, much less that its application is “clear and free from doubt ,” as \nit must in order to rebut Wynndalco’s initial showing of coverage .  Mashallah , 20 \nF.4th at 320 (quoting  4220 Kildare , LLC v. Regent Ins. Co. , 171 N.E.3d  957, 966 (Ill. \nApp. Ct. 2020)).   Accordingly,  the BIPA claims in the Thornley and Calderon Lawsuits \ntrigger Citizens’ duty to defend Wynndalco.4  See Krishna , 2021 WL 2005464, at *10  \n(to the ex tent that language in an insurance policy is ambiguous, it must be construed \nin favor of coverage) ; Bradley Hotel  Corp. v. Aspen Specialty Ins. Co. , 19 F.4th 1002,  \n \n4  To the extent that Wynndalco seeks a declaratory judgment as to indemnification, \nthat request is denied as premature.  See Lear Corp. v. Johnson Elec. Holdings Ltd. , 353 F.3d \n580, 583 (7th Cir. 2003) (“[T]he determination of whether [defendant] has a duty to indemnify \nis not ripe until the underlying litigation is terminated.” (cleaned up)).  Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 13 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n \n1006  (7th Cir. 2021) .  Moreover, because Citizens has a duty to defend Wynndalco \nwith respec t to the BIPA claims, it also has a duty to defend Wynndalco with respect \nto the common law claims in the Thornley Lawsuit.  See Mesa Lab’ys, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. \nCo., 994 F.3d 865, 868 (7th Cir. 2021) (under Illinois law, “ if even one claim is covered, \nthen the insurer has a duty to defend the entire suit ”). \nIV. Conclusion  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Wynndalco’s motion for judgment on the pleadings \nis granted, and Citizens’ motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.  The Court \nholds that the Policy covers the Thornley  and Calderon  Lawsuits and that Citizens \nhas a duty to  defend Wynndalco and its officers, David Andalcio and Jose Flores, \nagainst the Thornley  and Calderon  Lawsuits.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court is providing preliminary approval for a class action settlement involving plaintiffs Joshua Lewis, Nathaniel Timmons, and James Cavanaugh against Lytx, Inc. The case involves claims related to privacy violations under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to the use of machine vision and artificial intelligence (MV+AI) to predict distracted driving behaviors using Lytx’s DriveCam. The court finds that the settlement, which includes a $4.25 million non-reversionary fund, appears fair and will likely be approved after a final hearing.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the use of Lytx’s MV+AI technology to predict distracted driving behaviors violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act by collecting and storing biometric data without consent from the vehicle operators.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted preliminary approval of the class action settlement, finding it likely to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. The court also certified the proposed settlement class and approved the settlement’s notice program.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A group of people is suing a company because it used cameras with smart tech to watch drivers and spot when they got distracted. This might have broken rules about keeping people's private info safe. The company decided to settle, meaning they agreed to pay money to the drivers but didn't admit they did anything wrong. The judge thinks the deal looks okay for now and wants to check again to make sure it's really fair for everyone before giving the final thumbs up.",

(Doc. 122).  The Motion attaches and \nincorporates a Class Action Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement” or “Settlement \nAgreement”)  (Doc. 125)  that, together with the exhibits thereto, sets forth the terms and \nconditions for the settlement of claims, on a class wide  basis, between Plaintiffs Joshua \nLewis, Nathaniel Timmons, and James Cavanaugh (“Plaintiffs”) , individually and on \nbehalf of the Settlement Class , and Defendant Lytx, Inc. (“Lytx” or “Defendant” and, \nalong with Plaintiffs, the “Parties” ). \nHaving carefully considered the Motion, the Settlement Agreement together with \nall exhibits and attachments thereto, the record in this matter, and the briefs and \narguments of counsel,  as set forth below,  the Court finds that it likely will be able to \napprove the Settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 1 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 2 of 16 \n Procedure 23(e)(2). The Court likewise finds that it will likely be able to certify a class for \npurposes of judgment on the Settlement under Rules 23(a) and (b)(3), and that the \nproposed plan of notice (the “Notice Program”) to the Settlement Class is the best notice \npracticable under the circumstanc es and consistent with the requirements of due process \nand Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2) . Accordingly, a  hearing should and will be \nheld after notice to the Settlement Class to confirm that the Settle ment is fair, reasonable, \nand adequate, and to determine whether this Court should enter judgment approving the Settlement and an order of dismissal of this action based upon the Settlement. For \nthese reasons,  the Court  GRANTS the Motion and  ORDERS as follows:  \n1. Unless otherwise defined herein, all terms that are capitalized herein shall have \nthe same meaning ascribed to those terms in the Settlement Agreement.   \n2. The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1332(d) and personal jurisdiction over the Parties and the members of \nthe Settlement Class.  \nPRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT  \n4. The Court finds that, subject to the Final Approval Hearing, the Court will likely \nbe able to approve the Settlement as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best \ninterests of the Settlement Class.  \n5. The Court further finds that the Settlement substantially fulfills the purposes and objectives of the class action and provides beneficial relief to the Settlement Class, \nespecially considering the risks and delay of continued litigation.  \n6. The Court further finds that Plaintiffs and Class Counsel have adequately Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 2 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 3 of 16 \n represented, and will continue to adequately represent, the Class.  \n7. The Court further preliminarily finds that the Settlement is substantively fair. The \nCourt will assess Class Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees and expenses after \nreceiving a motion from Class Counsel supporting such request. At this stage, the \nCourt fi nds that the plan to request fees and litigation expenses creates no reason \nnot to grant the Motion and direct notice to the Class.  \n8. The Court preliminarily finds that the Settlement relief provided —a $4,250,000 \nnon- reversionary settlement fund (“Settlement Fund”) —is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate taking into account, inter alia , the costs, risks, and delay of further \nlitigation, trial and appeal, the alleged harm to the Class, the proposed method of \ndistributing payments to the Class and the absence of any agreement required to \nbe identified under Rule 23(e)(3).  \n9. The Court also finds that the Settlement Agreement: (a) is the result of arm’s -\nlength negotiations involving experienced counsel, with the assistance of a \nmediator; (b) is sufficient to warrant notice of the Settlement and the Final \nApproval Hearing to the  Settlement Class; (c) meets all applicable requirements of \nlaw, including Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and the Class Action Fairness \nAct (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1715; and (d) is not a finding or admission of liability \nby Lytx.  \nCERTIFICATION OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS \n10. Under Rules 23(a) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and solely for purposes of judgment on the proposed Settlement, the Court preliminarily Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 3 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 4 of 16 \n approves the following settlement class (“Settlement Class”):  \nAll individuals who, while present in the State of Illinois, operated a vehicle \nequipped with a Lytx DriveCam® Event Recorder (“DriveCam”), and for whom machine vision and artificial intelligence (“MV+AI”) was used to \npredict distracted driving behaviors b etween October 12, 2016, and the \nearlier of Preliminary Approval or January 1, 2025. \n \n11. Excluded from the Settlement Class are (1) any Judge or Magistrate  Judge  \npresiding over this Action and members of their families; (2) Defendant, its \nsubsidiaries, parent companies, successors, predecessors, and any entity in which \nDefendant or its parents have a controlling interest and their current or former \nofficers, direc tors, agents, and attorneys; (3) persons who properly execute and file \na timely request for exclusion from the Settlement Class; and (4) the legal \nrepresentatives, successors or assign s of any such excluded persons.  \n12. All Persons who are members of the Settlement Class who have not submitted a \ntimely request for exclusion are referred to collectively as “Settlement Class \nMembers” or individually as a “Settlement Class Member.”  \n13. For purposes of settlement only, the Court finds that it will likely be able to certify \nthe Settlement Class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3), as the \nprerequisites thereunder appear to be  met, including (1) that the Settlement Class \nis sufficiently  numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) that there \nare questions of law and fact common to members of the Settlement Class that \npredominate over questions affecting only individual members (e.g., whether Lytx \ncollected an d stored Settlement Class Members’ biometric data, without consent, \nthrough dash cam devices in a manner that violated BIPA, and whether Plaintiffs Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 4 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 5 of 16 \n and the Settlement Class Members are entitled to uniform statutory damages \nunder BIPA); (3) that Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the Settlement \nClass; (4) that Plaintiffs and Class Counsel will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of  the Settlement Class; and (5) that a settlement class action is a superior \nmethod of fairly and efficiently adjudicating this Action.  \n14. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, and for settlement purposes only. \nPlaintiffs Joshua Lewis, James Cavanaugh, and Nathaniel Timmons are hereby \nappointed Class Representatives,  and the following are hereby appointed as Class \nCounsel:  Carney Bates & Pulliam PLLC; Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP; \nMilberg Coleman Bryson Phillips Grossman PLLC; Workplace Partners, P.C.; \nWerman Salas P.C.; and Nick Larry Law LLC. \n15. The Court finds that the above attorneys are competent and capable of exercising \nthe responsibilities of Class Counsel and that Plaintiffs will adequately protect the \ninterests of the Settlement Class defined above.  \n16. Certification of the Settlement Class shall be solely for settlement purposes and \nwithout prejudice to the Parties in the event the Settlement is not finally approved \nby this Court or otherwise does not take effect. The Parties preserve all rights and \ndefe nses regarding class certification in the event the Settlement is not finally \napproved by this Court or otherwise does not take effect.  \nNOTICE AND ADMINISTRATION \n17. The Court directs the Settlement Administrator to perform the functions and \nduties set forth in the Settlement Agreement and to provide such other Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 5 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 6 of 16 \n administration services as are reasonably necessary to facilitate the completion of \nthe Settlement.  \n18. The Court has carefully considered the forms and methods of notice to the Settlement Class set forth in the Settlement (“Notice Program”). The Court finds \nthat the Notice Program is reasonably calculated to apprise members of the \nSettlement Class of the pendency of this action, the terms of the Settlement, and \nthe right to object to the Settlement and to exclude themselves from the Settlement \nClass. The Court finds that the Notice Program constitutes the best notice \npracticable under the circumstances and f ully satisfies the requirements of  Rule 23 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the requirements of due process, and the \nrequirements of any other applicable law, such that the terms of the Settlement, \nthe releases provided for therein, and this Court’s final judgment will be binding \non all Settlement Class Members. The Court further finds that the Notice Program \nconstitutes valid, due, and sufficient notice to all persons entitled thereto, and \nmeets the requirements of due process. Accordingly, the Cou rt finds that no notice \nother than that specifically identified in the Settlement Agreement is necessary.  \n19. The Court hereby approves the Notice Program and the form, content, and requirements of the Postcard Notice attached as Exhibit C to the Settlement \nAgreement, the Email Notice attached as Exhibit B to the Settlement Agreement, \nand the Long Form Notice atta ched as Exhibit D to the Settlement Agreement (the \n“Notices”), and the Claim Form attached as Exhibit E to the Settlement Agreement (the “Claim Form”).  Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 6 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 7 of 16 \n 20.  The Court finds that the Notices clearly and concisely state in plain, easily \nunderstood language, inter alia : (a) the nature of the case; (b) the definition of the \nSettlement Class; (c) the class claims and issues; (d) that the Court will exclude from the Settlement Class any Settlement Class member who timely and validly \nrequests exclusion; (e) the time and man ner for requesting such exclusion; and \n(f) the binding effect of a class judgment on Settlement Class members under Rule \n23(c)(3). The Parties, by  agreement, may revise the Notices and Claim Form in \nways that are not material, or in ways that are appropriate to update those \ndocuments for purposes of accuracy or formatting, consistent with this Order.  \n21. In compliance with the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 28 U.S.C. § 1715, \nDefendant shall promptly provide written notice of the proposed Settlement to the \nappropriate authorities.  \n22. The Settlement Administrator shall cause the Notice Program to be executed \nwithin 70 days  following the entry of this Order (the “Notice Date”). Class \nCounsel, prior to the Final Approval Hearing, shall file with the Court a declaration executed by the Settlement Administrator attesting to the timely \ncompletion of the Notice Program.  \n23. No later than the Notice Date, the Settlement Administrator shall maintain the \nSettlement Website to provide full information about the Settlement and allow for \nthe filing of claims online.  \n24. No later than 16 days  prior to the Final Approval Hearing, the Settlement \nAdministrator shall serve on counsel for all Parties a declaration stating that the Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 7 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 8 of 16 \n Notice required by the Agreement has been completed in accordance with the \nterms of the Preliminary Approval Order, and that the CAFA Notice was served. \nThe Settlement Administrator shall likewise provide Defendant and Class Counsel \nwith a final list of pe rsons who submitted timely and valid requests for exclusion \nfrom the Settlement Class.  \nSUBMISSION OF CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR EXCLUSIONS \n25. Settlement Class Members who wish to receive benefits under the Settlement must \ncomplete and submit a timely and valid Claim Form in accordance with the \ninstructions contained therein. To be timely, Claim Forms must be postmarked or \nreceived by the Settlement Administrator by  June  25, 20 25. Settlement Class \nMembers who do not submit a claim and those who do not submit a timely and \nvalid claim will not receive a payment under the Settlement, but they will be \nbound by the Settlement.  \n26. The Settlement Administrator shall review all claims to determine their validity \nand shall employ reasonable procedures to screen claims for abuse and fraud, and \ndeny claims where there is evidence of abuse or fraud. The Settlement \nAdministrator may reject any claim that is not submitted by a Settlement Class \nMember; that does not comply in any material respect with the instructions on the \nClaim Form; or that is submitted after the Claims Deadline.  \n27. As set forth in the Settlement Agreement, each claimant who submits an invalid \nClaim Form to the Settlement Administrator must be given a notice of the Claim \nForm’s deficiency and an opportunity to cure the deficiency within 21 days  of the Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 8 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 9 of 16 \n date of the notice. The Settlement Administrator may contact any Person who has \nsubmitted a Claim Form to obtain additional information necessary to verify the \nClaim Form. Each and every member of the Settlement Class who does not timely \nand validly submit  a claim shall be forever barred from participating in any \ndistributions of the Settlement Fund, and shall be bound by all determinations and orders pertaining to the Settlement, including the release of all claims to the extent \nset forth in the Settlement, unless such person requests exclusion from the \nSettlement in a timely and proper manner, as hereinafter provided.  \n28. A member of the Settlement Class wishing to request exclusion (or “opt- out”) from \nthe Settlement shall mail a request for exclusion to the Settlement Administrator. \nThe request for exclusion must be in writing, must be mailed to the Settlement \nAdministrato r at the address specified in the Notice, must be postmarked no later \nthan 60 days  following the Notice Date (“Opt- Out Deadline”), must include \n(a) his/her full name, address, and current telephone number; (b) the entity or \nentities for whom they drove and  when; (c) all grounds for the request to be \nexcluded, with factual and legal support for the stated request, including any \nsupporting materials; (d) the identification of any other exclusion requests he/she \nhas filed, or has had filed on his/her behalf, i n any other class action cases in the \nlast five years; and (e) the requestor’s signature. The request for exclusion shall not be effective unless it provides the required information and is made within the \ntime stated above. No member of the Settlement Cla ss, or any person acting on \nbehalf of or in concert or in participation with a member of the Settlement Class, Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 9 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 10 of 16 \n may request exclusion of any other member of the Settlement Class from the \nSettlement.  \n29. Members of the Settlement Class who timely request exclusion from the Settlement will relinquish their rights to benefits under the Settlement and will not \nrelease any claims against Lytx.  \n30. All members of the Settlement Class who do not timely and validly request \nexclusion shall be bound by all terms of the Settlement Agreement and by the Final \nApproval Order and Judgment even if they have previously initiated or \nsubsequently initiate individual litigation or any other proceedings against Lytx.  \n31. The Settlement Administrator shall promptly provide all Parties with copies of any exclusion requests, and Plaintiffs shall file a list of all persons who have validly \nopted out of the Settlement with the Court prior to the Final Approval Hearing.  \nAPPEARANCES AND OBJECTIONS  \n32. Any member of the Settlement Class who does not file a timely request for \nexclusion, but who wishes to object to approval of the proposed Settlement, to the \naward of attorneys’ fees and costs, or to the Service Awards to the Class \nRepresentatives must file  with the Court a written statement (along with any \nsupporting papers), postmarked or filed on or before 60 days  following the Notice \nDate (“Objection Deadline”), that includes a caption or title that identifies it as \n“Objection to Class Settlement in Lewi s, et al. v. Lytx, Inc., Case No. 3:22- cv-00046-\nNJR.” The written statement must also include: (1) the objector’s name and \naddress; (2) an explanation of the basis upon which the objector claims to be a Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 10 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 11 of 16 \n Settlement Class Member; (3) all grounds for the objection, including all citations \nto legal authority and evidence supporting the objection; (4) the name and contact \ninformation of any and all attorneys representing, advising, or in any way \nassisting the objector in connection with the preparation or submission of the \nobjection or who may profit from the pursuit of the objection (the “Objecting \nAttorneys”); (5) a statement indicating whether the objector intends to appear at \nthe Final Approval Hearing (eit her personally or through their Objecting \nAttorneys who shall file an appearance with the Court in accordance with the Local Rules); (6) a list of all class action settlements to which the objector has \nlodged an objection in the last five years; (7) the ob jector’s handwritten or \nelectronically imaged written signature; and (8) if a Settlement Class Member or \nany of the Objecting Attorneys has objected to any class action settlement where \nthe objector or the Objecting Attorneys asked for or received any paym ent in \nexchange for dismissal of the objection, or any related appeal, without any \nmodification to the settlement, a statement identifying each such case by full case \ncaption and amount of payment received.  \n33. A Settlement Class Member who has timely filed a written objection stating the \nSettlement Class Member’s intention to appear at the Final Approval Hearing as \nset forth above may appear at the Final Approval Hearing in person or through \ncounsel to be heard orally regarding his or her objection. It is not necessary, \nhowever, for a Settlement Class Member who has filed a timely objection to appear \nat the Final Approval Hearing. No Settlement Class Member wishing to be heard Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 11 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 12 of 16 \n orally in opposition to the approval of the Settlement and/or the request for \nattorneys’ fees and costs and/or the request for a Service Award to each of the \nClass Representatives will be heard unless that Settlement Class Member has filed \na timely written  objection as set forth above, including a statement that the \nSettlement Class Member intends to appear at the Final Approval Hearing.  \n34. Any Settlement Class Member who does not make an objection to the Settlement \nin the manner provided herein shall be deemed to have waived and forfeited any \nand all rights he or she may have to object, appear, present witness testimony, \nand/or submit eviden ce; shall be barred from appearing, speaking, or introducing \nany testimony or evidence at the Final Approval Hearing; shall be precluded from seeking review of the Settlement by appeal or other means; and shall be bound by \nall terms of the Settlement and b y all proceedings, orders, and judgments in the \nAction.  \n35. Any challenge to the Settlement Agreement or the Final Approval Order and \nJudgment shall be pursuant to appeal under the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure and not through a collateral attack.  \nFINAL APPROVAL HEARING  \n37. The Final Approval Hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) will \nbe held before this Court on July 24 , 2025,  at 1:30 p.m. for the following purposes: \n(i) to finally determine whether the applicable prerequisites for settlement class \naction treatment under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3) are met; \n(ii) to determine whether the Settlement is fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 12 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 13 of 16 \n best interests of the Class, and should be given final approval by the Court; (iii) to \ndetermine whether the judgment as provided under the Settlement Agreement \nshould be entered, dismissing this Action with prejudice and releasing all Released \nClaims; (iv ) to consider the application for an award of attorneys’ fees and \nexpenses of Class Counsel; (v) to consider the application for a Service Award to each of the Class Representatives; (vi) to consider the distribution of the Settlement \nbenefits under the terms of the Settlement Agreement; and (vii) to rule upon such \nother matters as the Court may deem appropriate.  \n38. On or before 21 days  after the Notice Date, Class Counsel shall file any application \nfor attorneys’ fees and expenses and Service Awards to the Class Representatives \n(the “Fee Petition”).  \n39. No later than 14 days  prior to the Final Approval Hearing, Plaintiffs shall file \npapers in support of final approval of the settlement.  \n40. The Final Approval Hearing may be postponed, adjourned, transferred, or continued by order of the Court without further notice to the Settlement Class. At \nor following the Final Approval Hearing, the Court may enter a Final Approval \nOrder and Judgment in a ccordance with the Settlement Agreement that will \nadjudicate the rights of all class members.  \n41. For clarity, the deadlines the Parties and members of the Settlement Class shall \nadhere to are as follows:  \n  Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 13 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 14 of 16 \n EVENT  DATE  \nNotice Date  March 2 8, 2025  \nClass Counsel’s Fee and Cost \nApplication  April 1 8, 202 5 \nClaims Deadline  June 25, 2025  \nObjection/Opt -Out Deadline  May 2 8, 2025  \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Final Approval  July 10, 2025  \nFinal Approval Hearing  July 24, 2025  \n \n42. Settlement Class Members do not need to appear at the Final Approval Hearing \nor take any other action to indicate their approval.  \nFURTHER MATTERS  \n43. To facilitate the Settlement, Plaintiffs are GRANTED leave to file an Amended \nClass Action Complaint solely for the purpose of adding  Plaintiffs Cavanaugh and \nTimmons.  \n44. All discovery and other pretrial proceedings in the Action as between Plaintiffs and Lytx are stayed and suspended until further order of the Court except such \nactions as may be necessary to implement the Settlement and this Order.  \n45. The Settlement does not constitute an admission, concession, or indication by the Parties of the validity of any claims or defenses in the Action or of any liability, \nfault, or wrongdoing of any kind by Lytx, which vigorously denies all of the claims \nand a llegations raised in the Action.  \n46. In the event that the Settlement is terminated under the terms of the Settlement, or if for any reason whatsoever the approval of it does not become final and no longer \nsubject to appeal, then: (i) the Settlement shall be null and void, including any Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 14 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 15 of 16 \n provisions related to the award of attorneys’ fees and costs, shall have no further \nforce and effect with respect to any party in this Action, and may not be referred \nto or used as evidence or for any other purpose whatsoever in the Action or any \nother action or proceeding; (ii) all negotiations, proceedings, documents prepared, \nand statements made in connection therewith shall be without prejudice to any \nperson or party hereto, shall not be deemed or construed to be an admission by \nany party of any act, ma tter, or proposition, and shall not be used in any manner \nof or for any purpose in any subsequent proceeding in this Action, provided, however, that the termination of the Settlement shall not shield from subsequent \ndiscovery any factual information provided in connection with the negotiation of \nthis Settlement that would ordinarily be discoverable but for the attempted \nsettlement; (iii) this Order shall be vacated and of no further force or effect \nwhatsoever, as if it had never been entered; and ( iv) any p arty may elect to move \nthe Court to implement the provisions of this paragraph, and none of the non -\nmoving parties (or their counsel) shall oppose any such motion.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The court dismissed John Flynn's pro se complaint alleging a conspiracy involving the installation of 5G networks in Connecticut to control the population and cause harm. The complaint was dismissed due to lack of standing and failure to present plausible grounds for relief, as Flynn did not provide specific personal injuries or concrete evidence linking the alleged harms directly to the defendants. The ruling highlighted AI as part of Flynn’s claims, mentioning 5G as a tool for “secretive data collection” through AI.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Flynn's conspiracy claims regarding 5G network installations provided sufficient plausible grounds for relief and standing in federal court.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court dismissed the complaint as Flynn lacked standing, failed to allege a concrete and particularized injury, and did not provide plausible claims against the defendants. The court allowed the possibility for Flynn to amend the complaint if he could address these concerns.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you believe a new cell phone technology, 5G, is secretly harmful and part of a big conspiracy with the government. You try to sue a lot of important people and companies but don't explain well how exactly this harms you or what each person did wrong. The judge says you can't sue like this because you didn't show how you were directly and clearly hurt or prove a real problem. The judge says if you can explain these things better, you can try again.",

No. 3:22- cv-1065 (JAM)  \n \nORDER OF DISMISSAL  \nPlaintiff John Flynn has filed a pro se  complaint  primarily  alleging that the recent \ninstallation of 5G networks in Connecticut is  part of a wide -ranging conspiracy between \ngovernment and industry to harm and  assert control over the general population. Because the \ncomplaint does not establish a plausible ground for  the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction and in the \nalternative fails to allege plausible grounds for relief, I will grant without prejudice the \ndefendants’ motions  to dismiss  and otherwise dismiss Flynn’s remaining claims.  \nBACKGROUND  \nThe following facts are taken from the operative complaint and assumed to be true solely \nfor the purposes of this ruling.1 \nFlynn names 21 defendants, including Verizon Communications Inc. Wireless, Yale New \nHaven Hospital, United States Senator Richard Blumenthal, and various Connecticut  state \nofficials and  telecommunications and utility companies .2 He alleges in sprawling terms a \nconspiracy and collusion between industry and government to install 5G  during the COVID -19 \npandemic . \n \n1 Doc. #64.  \n2 Id. at 1-6.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 231   Filed 08/10/23   Page 1 of 122 \n According to Fl ynn, 5G is a biological weapon that causes “inflammation, cellular \nvibration, and auto- immune failure.”3 He explains that “[p]ulsed  microwave \nmillimeter/technology,” presumably the kind he believes is emitted by the 5G network, “can be \nused for secretive data collection, harvesting, and AI . . . as well as hacking the human mind and body.”\n4 He additionally claims that “5G exposure to water changes it s structure,” and “causes \nhundreds of side effects.”5 He points to a 1999 study that “proved the biological effect of cancer” \nof 5G.6 As the complaint puts it, “[t]he rollout of 5G will create twice the radiation of the sun . . . \n[5G] wi ll kill the environment.”7 And “Ct is building a digital open- air concentration camp, \nusing a lockdown, using smart city, data collection or social credits” and using “surveillance/artificial intelligence learning and scoring for compliance social credits .”\n8 \nOnly two paragraphs  of the complaint describe any harm  or injury that has been \npersonally experienced by Flynn. Paragraph 4 states as follows: “Myself and every CT resident \nis and has been harmed; I have type one diabetes. I am high risk and disabled.”9 Paragraph 26 \nstates that “[t]hese defendants changed my environment and knowingly radiated every person in \nthe State of CT.”10 \nFlynn goes on to allege that the Connecticut l egislature and federal and s tate senators  \nwere “privately enriched by the electronics industry” to implement 5G during the pandemic.11 \nHe accuses Governor Lamont of using “executive authority during a pandemic and further \n \n3 Id. at 6. \n4 Id. at 7.  \n5 Id. at 13.  \n6 Ibid.  \n7 Id. at 16.  \n8 Id. at 17.  \n9 Id. at 7.  \n10 Id. at 11.  \n11 Id. at 6.

A complaint may not survive unless it alleges facts that, taken as true, give rise to \nplausible grounds to sustain the Court’s  jurisdiction and the merits of a plaintiff ’s claims for \nrelief. See Brownback v. King, 141 S. Ct. 740, 749 (2021); Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) .25 Even to the extent that no particular defendant has moved to dismiss, t his Court also \nhas authority to sua sponte  review and dismiss a complaint if it is “frivolous or malicious” or if it \notherwise “fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.” See  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).  \nBecause Flynn is  a pro se  plaintiff , the Court liberally construes the pleadings to raise the \nstrongest arguments that they suggest. See, e.g., Publicola v. Lomenzo, 54 F.4th 108, 111 (2d Cir. \n2022) ( per curiam ). Still, a pro se  complaint may not survive dismissal if its factual allegations \ndo not meet the basic plausibility standard. Se e Meadows v. United Servs., Inc., 963 F.3d 240, \n243 (2d Cir. 2020) ( per curiam ). \n \n21 Doc. #64 at 16 -17. \n22 Id. at 16, 18.   \n23 Id. at 7.  \n24 See Docs. #79, #81, #86, #113.  \n25 Unless otherwise noted, this ruling omits all internal quotation marks, citations, brackets, and other alterations in \nits quotations and citations of case decisions.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 231   Filed 08/10/23   Page 4 of 125 \n  Additional plaintiffs  \nAs a preliminary matter, Flynn has named as additional plaintiffs Phil Marie, Ludis Nino, \nNancy Linley, Vira Megencishvili, “9 ladies,” Jane Doe, John Doe, and “100 Pro Se .”26 But \nFlynn is the only one who has signed the complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(a) (requiring every \npleading to “be signed . . . by a party personally if the party is unrepresented”). As the Court has previously indicated, because Flynn is not an attorney he does not have authority to represent third parties and add them as co- plaintiffs.\n27 See Berrios v. New York City Housing Authority , \n564 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2009). Accordingly, I evaluate the adequacy of the complaint solely \nwith respect to Flynn and not any other putative plaintiffs . \nStanding  \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to “Cases” \nand “Controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. “To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show (1) an injury in fact, (2) a sufficient causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S. 149, 157- 58 (2014); Picard v. Magliano, \n42 F.4th 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2022). A n injury- in-fact must be “concrete and particularized and actual \nor imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Susan B. Anthony List , 573 U.S. at 158. A  \nconcrete injury is one that “must actually exist” —it must be “real and not abstract.”  Spokeo, Inc. \nv. Robins , 578 U.S. 330, 340 (2016).  \n \n26 See Doc. #64 at 1- 2.  \n27 See Doc. #122.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 231   Filed 08/10/23   Page 5 of 126 \n Flynn alleges that he “and every CT resident is and has been harmed” by the 5G \nnetwork.28 He explains that he is “high risk and disabled.”29 And he alleges that the defendants \nhave “changed my environment and knowingly radiated every person in the State of CT.”30 \nBut Flynn offers no further details as to the nature or extent of his injury. For example, \nthe complaint claims  that “5G penetrates cement and causes mutation.”31 But Flynn does not \nallege that he has experienced  any mutations.  Nor does he  describe how he has personally been \naffected —actually or imminently —by any of the negative health conseque nces he claims are \nassociated with 5G. See, e.g., Strunk v. New York , 2019 WL 5788560, at *5 -6 (N.D.N.Y. 2019) \n(plaintiff lacked standing to challenge defendants’ implementation of 4G and 5G networks, \nwhich allegedly posed health and safety risks  “to residents of New York and elsewhere,” where \nplaintiff failed to allege defendants’ conduct harmed him in a “personal and individual way”).  \nWhile the “standard for review ing standing at the pleading stage is lenient, a plaintiff \nmay not rely solely on concl usory allegations of injury or ask the court to draw unwarranted \ninferences in order to find standing.”  Calcano v. Swarovski N . Am. Ltd., 36 F.4th 68, 76 (2d Cir. \n2022)  (quoting Baur v. Veneman, 352 F.3d 625, 636- 37 (2d Cir. 2003) ). Flynn has not plausibly \nalleged that he has  personally suffered an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or \nimminent in order to allow him standing to bring any of his claims . \nMoreover, a plaintiff must allege facts to show that his injury is traceable to the conduct \nof the defendant. The complaint, however, mostly lumps the defendants together as one and does not include allegations to show how each particular defendant has eng aged in conduct that has \ncaused an injury to Flynn. \n \n28 Doc. #64 at 7.  \n29 Ibid.  \n30 Id. at 11.  \n31 Id. at 15.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 231   Filed 08/10/23   Page 6 of 127 \n Merits \nEven assuming Flynn had standing, I conclude that he has not alleged plausible grounds \nfor relief. As to his claims against the United States (which was substituted as a party in place  of \nSenator Blumenthal), any claims against the United States and its agencies are ordinarily barred under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. See F.D.I.C. v. Meyer , 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994). \nAlthough the Federal Tort Claims Act allows the United States to be liable for certain torts, it “requires that a claimant exhaust all administrative remedies before filing a complaint in federal district court.”  Celestine v. Mount Vernon Neighborhood Health Ctr ., 403 F.3d 76, 82 (2d Cir. \n2005). The exhaustion requirement “is jurisdictional and cannot be waived, ” and it “ extends to \nall suits, including those begun in state court .” Ibid. But here Flynn has made no showing that he \nhas exhausted his administrative remedies. Accordingly, F lynn has not stated plausible grounds \nfor relief against the United States.  \nFlynn has also named as defendants a large number of Connecticut state officials: \nMelanie Bachman, Executive Director of the State of Connecticut Siting Council; Marissa Paslick -Gillett, Director of the Public Utility Regulatory Authority; Nick Simmons, Manager of \nStrategic Initiatives for the Office of the Governor; Paul F. Hinch, Siting Counsel for the Office of Policy Management; Saud Anwar, Deputy President Pro- Tempore and CT Public Health Vice \nChair; Bob Duff, Chair of the Energy and Technology Committee; Themis Klarides, Connecticut Minority Leader; and Norm Needleman, Chair of Energy and Technology.\n32 \nThe Eleventh Amendment and related principles of state sovereign immunity generally \ndivest the federal courts of jurisdiction over lawsuits by private citizens against the States, any state government entities, and any state government officials in their official capacities. See \n \n32 Id. at 2-6. Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 231   Filed 08/10/23   Page 7 of 128 \n generally Lewis v. Clarke, 581 U.S. 155, 161–62 (2017); T.W. v. N.Y. State Bd. of L. Examiners , \n996 F.3d 87, 91–92 (2d Cir. 2021). While Congress may abrogate a State’s sovereign immunity, \nit did not do so through § 1983. See Chris H. v. New York , 740 F. App’ x 740, 741 (2d Cir. 2018). \nTo the extent Flynn’s claims are alleged against the various Connecticut state defendants in their official capacities  for an award of money damages , they are therefore barred by the Eleventh \nAmendment. \nTo be sure, there is an exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity for official -capacity \nclaims against state officials that seek injunctive relief against a continuing violation of federal law. See Virginia Office for Protection and Advocacy  v. Stewart , 563 U.S. 247, 255- 56 (2011);  \nVega v. Semple , 963 F.3d 259, 281 (2d Cir. 2020). But the complaint does not allege facts to \nplausibly show that any of the state defendants are engaged in any ongoing violation of federal law.  \nTo the extent Flynn is instead suing state  officials in their individual capacities, \nConnecticut state law provides that “[n]o state officer or employee shall be personally liable for damage or injury, not wanton, reckless or malicious, caused in the discharge of his or her duties or within the scope of his or her employment.” Conn. Gen. Stat. § 4- 165(a).  Flynn’s allegations \nagainst the state officials center on their purported involvement with the decision to place 5G \ntowers at certain sites around the state.  He does not all ege that these responsibilities were \nunrelated to their duties  or otherwise outside the scope of their authority, and therefore these \nstate officials have statutory immunity.  \nFlynn does claim that the state official defendants “took bribes with total disregard for \nsafety.”\n33 The Connecticut Supreme Court has made clear that statutory immunity does not \n \n33 Id. at 6.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 231   Filed 08/10/23   Page 8 of 129 \n extend to “ wanton, reckless or malicious actions, or for actions not performed within the scope \nof . . . employment.”  Miller v. Egan, 265 Conn. 301, 319 (2003). However, “the exception is \nlimited to actions seeking declaratory or injunctive relief,” and does not extend to claims for \nmonetary damages.  Id. at 326- 27. Flynn’s claim s for monetary damages against the state \ndefendants would therefore still be barred under section 4- 165.34 Nor as to any particular state \ndefendant does Flynn plausibly allege that they received a bribe.  \nMore generally and apart from the immunity defenses  for the governmental defendants , \nthe complaint fails to  state plausible grounds for relief against any of the named defendants. “A \ncourt may dismiss a claim as factually frivolous if the sufficiently well- pleaded facts are clearly \nbaseless —that is if they  are fanciful, fantastic[,] or delusional.”  Gallop v. Cheney , 642 F.3d 364, \n368 (2d Cir. 2011)  (citing Denton v. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 32- 33 (1992)). Flynn’s description \nof a government -wide conspiracy to install 5G networks to control the population def ies rational  \nbelief . His allegations that 5G reduces human fertility, absorbs oxygen, and causes retinal \ndetachment  appear to be based on pure speculation and conjecture .35 See Weir v. City of New \nYork , 2023 WL 3001136, at *1 (2d Cir. 2023) (claims that unnamed government agents funneled \ntoxic gas into plaintiff’s car and poisoned his groceries  were factually frivolous and dismissal \nwas therefore proper) ; Appel v. Hayut , 2021 WL 2689059, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (declining to \ncredit  plaintiff’s allegations that Mount Sinai hospital employees were undercover Mossad \nassassins) .  \n \n34 While Flynn does state that he seeks a “declaratory judgment,” he nowhere specifies the nature of the declaratory \nrelief he seeks or even that he is seeking declaratory relief against the state- official defendants.  I therefore decline to \nconstrue his claims against the state defendants as a request for declaratory relief subject to an exception from the \nstatutory bar in section 4 -165. \n35 Id. at 13; id. at 15.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 231   Filed 08/10/23   Page 9 of 1210 \n Moreover, the complaint’s sweeping allegations of wrongdoing fail to specify what each \nparticular defendant did to violate Flynn’ s rights. Flynn accuses the defendants of numerous \nwrongs but does not explain what particular acts they did to  violate his rights.  For example, he  \nnames Yale New Haven Hospital as a defendant but makes no allegations that the hospital has \nharmed him. And he names a s defendants various companies but does not describe what they did \nto harm him.   \nFlynn’s failure to specify what acts each particular defendant undertook in violation of \nhis rights  also runs afoul of Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . This rule  requires \nthat each defendant have “fair notice of what the plaintiff ’s claim is and the ground upon which \nit rests.” Mohammad v. N.Y. State Higher Educ. Servs. Corp., 422 F. App’ x 61, 62–63 (2d Cir. \n2011).  A complaint does not satisfy Rule 8 “[b]y lumping all the defendants together in each \nclaim and providing no factual basis to distinguish their conduct.” Atuahene v. City of Hartford, 10 F. App’ x 33, 34 (2d Cir. 2001) .  \nIn sum, Flynn lacks standing  under Article III to bring this suit. And  he has fail ed to \nallege plausible grounds for relief  against any particular defendant  and in a manner consistent \nwith the basic notice requirements of Rule 8. Therefore, I will dismiss his complaint without the  \nneed at this time to address the additional arguments for dismissal that have been raised in the defendants’ motions to dismiss.  \nC\nONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court  GRANTS the defendants’ motions to dismiss \n(Docs. #79, #81, #86, #113), and otherwise dismiss es any remaining claims against any \nremaining defendants under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). But because a court should ordinarily allow a pro se plaintiff at least one oppor tunity to file an amended complaint  and because Flynn Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 231   Filed 08/10/23   Page 10 of 1211 \n has already sought leave to do so, t his dismissal is without prejudice to Flynn’s filing of an \namended complaint on or before September 1, 2023 if he has good faith grounds to file a n \namended complaint that overcomes the concerns stated in this ruling.  \nThe Court sets forth the following guidelines  concerning the filing of any amended \ncomplaint: \n1. Any amended complaint must clearly identify the names of each plaintiff and each \ndefendant  in the caption of the complaint  and must set forth facts to plausibly show how \neach named defendant has engaged in conduct that has proximately caused a concrete and \nparticularized actual or imminent injury to each plaintiff . \n2. Any amended complaint should enumerate each distinct claim or cause of action and the particular source or provision of state or federal law that was violated. To the extent that the amended complaint may cite or refer in passing to  any particular provision of the law, \nthe Court w ill not assume that the complaint seeks to allege a cause of action under this \nlaw unless the complaint includes an enumerated claim that cites this law.  For each claim \nor cause of action, the complaint should identify which defend ants the plaintiff or \nplaintiffs seek to hold liable.  \n3. Any amended complaint should take into concern the arguments raised in the defendants’ motions to dismiss including but not limited to the arguments of the defendants concerning the  proper identification of thei r name s, concerning adequacy of service of \nprocess, and concerning preemption of state law claims by federal law. See Kaspers v. Verizon Wireless Servs., LLC , 2021 WL 2193992, at *2- 4 (state law claims challenging \n5G network preempted by the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996) , recon. denied, \n2021 WL 2193584, at *2 -3 (N.D. Ga. 2021) . Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 231   Filed 08/10/23   Page 11 of 1212 \n 4. Any amended complaint shall be filed once. The docket reflects that Flynn has engaged \nin serial filing of proposed amended complaints. If Flynn chooses to file an amended complaint, the Court will allow him a single opportunity to do so and will treat the first-filed amended complaint as the operative amended complaint in this action. Therefore, Flynn should carefully draft a single complaint for filing rather than loading the docket with serial versions of amended complaints. \n5. If more than one plaintiff wishes to join Flynn in this action, any such plaintiff must personally sign the amended complaint, and the amended complaint must include allegations to substantiate each plaintiff’s standing  and right to relief as to each \ndefendant.  The Clerk of Court shall close this case subject to  automatic  re-opening in the event that \nFlynn chooses to timely file an amended complaint. If Flynn chooses to file an amended complaint, then any named defendant may file any answer or other response to the filing of the amended complaint within 30 days of its filing, and the Court may also conduct a further review of the adequacy of the complaint’s allegations  pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).  \nIt is so ordered.

    "summary": "1. Summary: In the case of Admiin Inc. d/b/a Paro Inc. v. Luke Kohan and FirmKey Solutions LLC, Paro sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) against its former employee Kohan and his new company, FirmKey, alleging breach of a non-compete agreement and potential misappropriation of trade secrets. Paro, being an AI-powered finance and accounting solutions marketplace, claimed Kohan used confidential information unfairly; however, the Court denied the TRO, finding that Paro did not sufficiently demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Paro is entitled to a temporary restraining order based on allegations that Kohan breached a non-compete agreement and that Paro's trade secrets were at risk of misappropriation through inevitable disclosure.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The Court denied the TRO request, finding that Paro did not adequately demonstrate a likelihood of success on its claims, including breach of the non-compete agreement and trade secrets misappropriation via inevitable disclosure. The Court highlighted issues with the scope of the non-compete as potentially overbroad and noted a lack of actual misappropriation evidence.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Paro, which uses AI to help businesses with their finances, was afraid that one of its former employees, who started a new competing company, might use the company's special secrets. They asked the court to quickly stop him, hoping to prove later that rules were broken. The court said no because Paro didn't show enough proof that they would definitely win, as they couldn't show the employee had actually taken or used their secrets.",

For the \nreasons stated below, the Court denies Paro’s  request for an emergency  temporary  \nrestraining  order. \nBackground  \n Paro , a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business in Chicago, \nIllinois,  is “an artificial intelligence -powered marketplace”  providing “various finance \nand accounting solutions to businesses through a combination of expert fractional \ntalent, data -driven tools and guiding insight s.” R. 1,  Compl. ¶¶ 2, 10.1 Through its \n“AI-powered platform, Paro matches clients with the best -fit expert to solve problems \n \n1Citations to the docket are indicated by “R.” followed by the docket number and, where \nnecessary, a page or paragraph citation.

Paro’s carefully curated expert community provides a range of \nfinancial services to clients, from basic bookkee ping and accounting to highly \nspecialized corporate development and strategic advisory services.”  Id. ¶ 10. Paro \nassigns employees to different client accounts. Id. ¶ 11. Paro has devoted substantial \nmoney, time, and resources in developing its clients, an d maintains their contact \ninformation, names of client contacts, types of services purchased throughout the \nclient relationship, and fee information. Id. ¶ 13. Paro also has a roster of experts. Id. \n¶ 16. Paro maintains this information is kept confidentially, along with other \nconfidential information as defined in the Employment Agreement (Confidential \nInformation) . Id. To safeguard this information , Paro protects it with computer \npasswords, limits em ployee access, restricts access to non -employees, requires certain \nemployees (like Kohan ) to sign Non- Competition, Non -Solicitation, Non -Disclosure \nand Invention Assignment Agreements, which, among other things, prohibit the \ndownload, transfer, or duplicat ion of Confidential Information, and requires Paro \nemployees to return all Confidential Information when they leave employment. Id. \n¶ 17.  \nKohan, a citizen of New York,  is a former Paro Senior Account Executive. \nCompl. ¶ 18. As a Senior Account Executive, Kohan was responsible for converting \nleads from Paro’s marketing team into long -term clients, managing full sales cycle \nfrom new leads to closing deals, building relationships with clients, and supporting \nParo team members. Id. In this role, he had direct client contact and expert contact, \nand knowledge of Paro’s Confidential Information. Id. ¶ 19. At the hearing  held on Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 2 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 3 July 17, 2023 (TRO hearing) , Paro described Kohan’s employment as being \nresponsible for the “white label client suite” at Paro, which is how Paro describes their \nbiggest and most valuable clients. Kohan voluntarily resigned his employment with \nParo in March 2023, and co -founded FirmKey in April 2023. Id.  ¶¶ 28– 29. FirmKey \nis engaged in the business of providing  various finance and accounting solutions to \nbusinesses. Id. ¶ 4. FirmKey is a Minnesota limited liability corporation. Id.  \nWhen he began his employment  with Paro on October 3, 2020, Kohan  signed a  \nNon- Competition, Non -Solicitation, Non -Disclosure and Invention Assignment \nAgreement (Employment Agreement ). Compl. ¶ 20; R. 1 -1, Exh. A  (Agmt.) . In the \nEmployment Agreement , Kohan agreed not to disclose, use, or misappropriate Paro’s \nConfidential Informa tion. Id. ¶ 21. The Employment Agreement  also provided that \nKohan could not, for a period of 12 months after leaving his employment  (the \nRestricted Period) , (1) compete directly or indirectly with Paro, (2) solicit any of Paro’s \nclients and employees, or (3) interfere with Paro’s client and employee relationships. \nId. ¶ 22. The non-competition restriction is contained in Section 4 of the Employment \nAgreement (Non -Compete) and provides : \nI agree that during the period of my  employment with  the Company  I will not \nengage  in any other employment, occupation  or consulting  arrangement  \nanywhere  in the world,  nor will I engage  in any other activities  that conflict  \nwith  my obligations  to the Company.  During  the Restricted Period (as defined \nbelow), I will not, anywhere  in the Restricted Territory  (as defined  below), \nwithout  the Company’s  prior written  consent,  directly  or indirectly,  alone  or \nas a partner,  member, manager,  owner,  joint  venturer,  officer,  director,  \nemployee, consultant,  agent,  contractor,  stockholder or in any other capacity  \nof any company  or entity,  engage  in the Business,  have  any financial interest \nin any company  or entity  engaging  in the Business or make  any loans  to \nany company  or entity  engaging  in the Business.  For purposes  of this \nAgreement, the term  “Business” means  (a) the provision  of outsourced Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 3 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 4 financial services,  including  bookkeeping and accounting,  financial analysis  \nand CFO  strategy  services,  or (b) the provision,  development, marketing,  \nsale or maintenance  of products  or services  which  are substantially  \nsimilar  to those developed, marketed,  distributed,  sold,  maintained  or \notherwise provided by, or actively  planned  to be developed, marketed,  \ndistributed,  sold,  maintained  or otherwise provided by the Company  during  the \nterm  of my employment with  the Company.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing, \nmy ownership  of not more  than one percent  (1%) of the outstanding  shares  of \nstock  of any corporation  having  a class  of securities  actively  traded on a \nnational  securities  exchange  or on the NASDAQ  Stock Market  shall not be \ndeemed, in and of itself,  to violate  the provisions  of this Section  4. I agree  \nand acknowledge  that the restrictions  in this Section 4 shall apply  \nthroughout  the Restricted Territory,  and that the geographic  scope  of the \nrestriction  is necessary  and reasonable  because  the Company  conducts  \nbusiness at least  nationally,  and the restriction  is necessary  to protect  the \nlegitimate  business  interests of the Company.  I further  agree  and \nacknowledge  that the restrictions in this Section 4  shall apply to self -\nemployment by me.  \n \nAgmt.  ¶ 4.  \n \nThe Non-C ompete not only includes being an employee of a competitor, but also \nan owner of a competitor.  Agmt. ¶ 4.  Based on Paro’s TRO Motion, and the \nconfirmation of counsel at the TRO hearing , Paro is only alleging breach of the Non-\nCompete restrictive covenant, and no other provisions of the Employment Agreem ent. \nThe “Restricted Territory” for purposes of the  Non-Compete includes “the \nUnited States and each other country, province, state, city, or other political \nsubdivision in which the Company carries on, had carried on the Business during the \nterm of [his] employment and/or the Restricted Period.” Agmt.  ¶ 8(f).  \n The Employment Agreement also includes a modification or “blue -pencil” \nprovision which states:  \nIf any provision or term in Sections 2, 4, and/or 7 of this Agreement is declared \ninvalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalid and \nunenforceable portion shall be reformed to the maximum time, geographic Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 4 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 5 scope, activity -related restrictions and/or limitations permitted by applicable \nlaw, so as to be valid and enforceab le. \n \nAgmt. ¶ 8(d). \nIn terms of bad acts by Kohan and FirmKey, Paro alleges as follows:  \n(1) Kohan founded and began working for FirmKey, a direct competitor to \nParo, in April 2023, in violation of the  Non-Compete (Compl. ¶ ¶ 29–30); \n \n(2) Kohan “viewed Paro as a trai ning ground, and he is now using, or will use, \nConfidential Information he learned at Paro” in violation of his Non -\nCompete (Compl. ¶ 30); \n  \n(3) Kohan “will not be able to compartmentalize his knowledge of Paro’s \nConfidential Information while operating FirmKe y” and will “consciously \nor unconsciously, inevitably draw upon his vast and intimate knowledge of \nParo’s Confidential Information” (Compl. ¶ 31);  \n \n(4) Kohan’s knowledge of Paro’s Confidential Information will assist him in \nperforming his responsibilities at FirmKey, and in targeting Paro’s clients \nand experts , and Kohan “cannot help but draw upon this knowledge in \nperforming his duties for FirmKey”  (Compl. ¶ 32);  and \n \n(5) Kohan’s “inevitable disclosure and use of Paro’s Confidential Information \nwill allow FirmKey to gain a substantial unfair advantage with Paro” \n(Compl. ¶ 34).  \n \nParo also generally alleges that Kohan “has threatened to misappropriate or \nwill inevitably misappropriate trade secrets and confidential information maintained \nby Paro in this district .” Compl. ¶ 8. Regarding FirmKey, Paro alleges that FirmKey \ndoes business in this D istrict, has also “threatened to misappropriate or will \ninevitably misappropriate trade secrets and confidential information maintained by  \nParo in this district.” Id. ¶ 9. \nParo attaches information from FirmKey’s website, as well as Kohan’s \nLinkedIn page,  to its Verified Complaint . In those attachments, FirmKey is described Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 5 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 6 as “targeting industries, services, and nuanced projects that align with our partners’ \nrespective backgrounds, interests, and bandwidth.” R. 1 -3, Kohan LinkedIn Post.  \nNow Paro brings this lawsuit , through a Verified Complaint for Injunctive and \nOther Relief,  assert ing the following claims  against Kohan and FirmKey : (1) Breach \nof the Employment Agreement (Kohan) (Count I); (2) Violation of the Illinois Trade \nSecrets Act (Kohan and FirmKey) (Count II); (3) Violation of the Defend Trade \nSecrets Act (Kohan and FirmKey) (Count III); and (4) Tortious Interference with \nContract (FirmKey) (Count IV).  \nParo filed its Verified Complaint on July 10, 2023. The same day , Paro filed an \nEmergency Rule 65 Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary \nInjunction ( TRO Motion), R. 7, Mot. TRO , and Memorandum of Law in support o f its \nMotion. R. 8, Memo.  TRO.  Through its TRO  Motion, Paro seeks to: (i) enjoin Kohan \nfrom working for FirmKey, and FirmKey from employing Kohan, (ii) enjoin Kohan \nand FirmKey from soliciting Paro’s clients or experts, (iii) enjoin Kohan and FirmKey \nfrom misappropriating Paro’s Confidential Information and trade secret information, \n(iv) enjoin FirmKey from interfering with Kohan’s contractual obligations to Paro, (v) \nrequire Kohan and FirmKey to return Paro’s Confidential Information and trade \nsecret information.  Mot. TRO, Proposed Order.  Paro also seeks its attorneys’ fees and \ncosts. Id. Paro also filed a Motion for Expedited Discovery. R. 9, Mot. Discovery.  \nKohan and FirmKey filed a response opposing the TRO and preliminary \ninjunction, supported by Kohan’s Declaration. R. 13, Resp.; R. 13 -1, Decl. Kohan.  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 6 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 7 The Court heard oral argument on the TRO2 on July 17, 2023. R. 15.  \nLegal Standard  \nA TRO is “an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be granted \nunless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  See \nGoodman v. Ill. Dep ’t of Fin. & Prof’ l Regulation , 430 F.3d 432, 437 (7th Cir.  2005) \n(quoting Mazurek v. Armstrong , 520 U.S. 968, 972 (1997)).  \nThe standard for obtaining a TRO is the same as that is required to issue a \npreliminary injunction. See Merritte v. Kessel , 561 Fed. Appx. 546, 548 (7th Cir.  2014). \nTo obtain a TRO, a movant must demonstrate: (1) a lik elihood of success on the \nmerits; (2) that it has no adequate remedy at law; and (3) that it will suffer \nirreparable harm if the relief is not granted. See Right Field Rooftops, LLC , 80 F.  \nSupp.  3d at 832 (citing Smith v. Executive Dir. Of Ind. War. Mem’ls Comm’n , 742 F. \n3d 282, 286 (7th Cir. 2014)).  \nIf the moving party meets this three -element threshold showing, the court \n“must weigh the harm that the plaintiff will suffer absent an injunction against the \nharm to the defendant from an injunction[.] ” GEFT Outdoors, LLC v. City of \nWestfield , 922 F.3d 357, 364 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting Planned Parenthood, of Ind. & \nKy., Inc. v. Comm’r of Ind. State Dep’t of Health , 896 F.3d 809, 816 (7th Cir. 2018)). \n“Specifically, the court weighs the irreparable harm that th e moving party would \nendure without the protection of the preliminary injunction against any irreparable \n \n2The Court will schedule a preliminary hearing, and rule on the preliminary injunction once \nit receives the full presentation of facts and law . See Right Fi eld Rooftops, LLC v. Chicago \nBaseball Holdings, LLC , 80 F.  Supp.  3d 829, 832 (N.D.  Ill. 2015) . Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 7 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 8 harm the nonmoving party would suffer if the court were to grant the requested \nrelief.” Girl Scouts of Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., Inc. , 549 F.3d \n1079, 1086 (7th Cir. 2008) (citing Abbott Labs. v Mead Johnson & Co. , 971 F.2d 6, \n11–12 (7th Cir. 1992)).  \n The Seventh Circuit has described this balancing test as a “sliding scale”: “if \na plaintiff is more likely to win, the balance of harms can weigh less heavily in its \nfavor, but the less likely a plaintiff is to win[,] the more that balance would need to \nweigh in its favor.” GEFT Outdoors , 992 F.3d at 364 (citing Planned Parenthood , 896 \nF.3d at 816). Finally, in balancing the harms, the court must consider the interests \nof non -parties in granting or denying the requested relief. Ty, Inc., v. Jones Grp., Inc. , \n237 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. 2001).  \n In resolving a motion for TRO, the Court reviews the record from a “neutral \nand objective viewpoint” without accepting Paro’s allegations as true, nor drawing \nreasonable inferences in Paro’s favor.  Doe v. Uni versity of Chicago , 2022 WL \n16744310, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 7, 2022) (citing  Doe v. Univ. of S. Indiana , 43 F.4th \n784, 791 (7th Cir. 2022)). The Court must “make factual determinations on the basis \nof a fair interpretation of the evidence before the court”  at this stage. Darryl H. v. \nColer, 801 F.2d 893, 898 (7th Cir. 1986). However , the findings are only preliminary, \nand “do not bind the district court as the case progresses.” Mich. v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Eng ’rs, 667 F.3d 765, 782 (7th Cir. 2011).  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 8 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 9 Analysis  \nI. Choice of Law  \nBefore addressing whether Paro has met its burden for a temporary \nrestraining order, the Court must determine what law governs.  \n The Employment Agreement contains a choice of law provision specifying that \nIllinois law applies to disputes arising out of the Agreement. Agmt. ¶ 11(a).  \nParagraph 11(a) of the Employment Agreement specifically states:  \nThis Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois. I hereby \nexpressly consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts \nlocated in Chicago, Illinois for any lawsuit arising from or relating to this \nAgreement, and agree that such courts shall be the sole and exclusive venue \nfor any such lawsuits (excepts with respect to post -judgment enforcement \nproceedings) filed by either party, in regard to claims or actions arising from \nor relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this Section \n11(a) shall restrict the Company from bringing a lawsuit in another venue to \nthe extent the Company is also bringing a lawsuit against a third party who is \nnot subject to jurisdiction in Chicago, Illinois.  \n \nAgmt. ¶  11(a).  \n \nBased upon the briefs and the representations of the parties at the TRO \nhearing, all parties agree that Illinois law applies to the state law claims alleged by \nParo.3 Neither Paro nor Kohan argue that any other law applies.  \n The law is clear that where a valid contract has been formed, a court should \nenforce the choice of law provision contained within that contract unless it violates \nthe forum state’s public policy, and the forum state has a materially greater interest \nin the litigation than the chosen state. See, e.g., Demitropoulos v. Bank One \n \n3At the TRO hearing, the parties both took the position that even if New York applied to the \nstate law claims, the Court would reach the same result.  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 9 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 10 Milwaukee, N.A. , 915 F. Supp. 1399, 1413 (N.D. Ill. 1996) (following § 187 of the \nRestatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws where “as here, the parties to a contract \nhave included an express choice of law provision in their contract”). Further, a court \nwill only overrule a choice of law contained in a contract if “(1) the chosen state has \nno substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction and there is no other \nreasonable basis for the parties’ choice, or (2) its application would be contrary to a \nfundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen \nstate in the determination of the particular issue.” Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Ace \nProperty and Cas. Ins. Co. , 906 N.E. 2d 630, 636 (Ill. App. Ct.  2009) (clean ed up).4 \nHere, the Court finds Paro, as a business headquartered in Illinois, has made \na sufficient showing that Illinois has a substantial relationship to the parties and the \ndispute. See Aon Risk Services Companies, Inc. v. Alliant Insurance Services, I nc., 415 \nF. Supp.  3d 843, 848 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (applying Illinois law to restrictive covenant \ndispute involving an employment agreement with a choice of law provision specifying \nIllinois).  \nThe Court having determined that Illinois law governs  this dispute, now turns \nto whether Paro has met its burden for the issuance of a TRO.  \nII. TRO Factors   \nThe Court begins with the likelihood of success . Paro insists that it has shown \na likelihood of success on the merits for all of its claims. For the reason s that follow, \n \n4This Opinion uses (cleaned up) to indicate that internal quotation marks, alterations, and \ncitations have  been omitted from quotations. See  Jack Metzler, Cleaning Up Quotations, 18 \nJournal of Appellate Practice and Process 143 (2017).  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 10 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 11 the Court finds that Paro has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits \nof its claims.  \na. Likelihood of Success  \ni. Breach of Contract  (Count I)  \nCount I of the Verified Complaint assert s a claim for breach of the Non-\nCompete restrictive covenant  contained in the Employment Agreement. Memo. TRO \nat 3–4. As stated above, a t the TRO hearing, Paro confirmed it was only alleging a \nbreach of this restrictive covenant by Kohan, and not any other  restrictive covenants \ncontained in the Employment Agreement. Accordingly, the Court only analyzes the \nNon-C ompete restrictive covenant.   \nIn relevant part, Paro’s Non-C ompete covenant prohibits Kohan, during the \nRestricted Period, from engaging in the Bus iness, and defines “Business” as:  \n(a) the provision of outsourced financial services, including bookkeeping and \naccounting, financial analysis and CFO strategy services, or (b) the provision, \ndevelopment, marketing, sale or maintenance of products or serv ices which are \nsubstantially similar to those developed, marketed, distributed, sold, \nmaintained or otherwise provided by, or actively planned to be during the term \nof [his] employment with the Company.   \n \nAgmt.  ¶ 4.  \n \nBefore address ing whether the restrictive covenant is reasonable, the Court  \nmust satisfy itself that (1) the Non-C ompete is ancillary to a valid contract and (2) is \nsupported by adequate consideration.  Allied Waste Services of North America, LLC v. \nTibble , 177 F.  Supp.  3d 1103, 1107 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (citing Fifield v. Premier Dealer \nServices, Inc. , 993 N.E.2d 938, 942 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013)). Here, Paro has demonstrated \nthat the Employment Agreement is a valid contract , that Kohan received a salary, Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 11 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 12 commissions, bonuses, and thousands of shares in stock options, and he was employed \nby Paro for over two years. Kohan and FirmKey do not challenge the validity of the \nEmployment Agreement itself, and instead argue that based on his original salary of \n$75,000, the Non-C ompete would not be enforceable if a recently passed Illinois law —\nthe Illinois Freedom to Work Act —applied retroactively. See  820 ILCS 90/10. \nHowever, that law became effective on January 1, 2022, and does not have retroactive \neffect. 820 ILCS 90/5. Thus, the Court fin ds at this preliminary stage , the challenged \nrestrictive covenant is ancillary to a valid contract , and supported by adequate \nconsideration.   \n The Court now turns to the reasonableness of the restrictive covenant in \nquestion. Before enforcing a restrictive covenant, the Court must determine whether \nit is reasonable.  W. Capra Consulting Group, Inc. v. Snyder, 2019 WL 3935045, at *9 \n(N.D. Ill. Aug. 20, 2019). Under Illinois law, “[a] restrictive covenant  . . . is reasonable \nonly if the covenant: (1) is no greater than is required for the protection of a legitimate \nbusiness interest of the employer -promisee; (2) does not impose undue hardship on \nthe employee- promisor, and (3) is not injurious to the public.” Reliable Fire Equip. \nCo. v. Arredondo , 965 N.E.2d 393, 396 (Ill. 2011).  In analyzing whether a restrictive \ncovenant is, in fact, for a “legitimate business interest,” the Court must examine “the \ntotality of the facts and circumstances of the individual case. Factors to be considered \nin this analysis include, but are not limited to, the near -permanence of customer \nrelationships, the employee’ s acquisition of confidential information through his \nemployment, and time and place restrictions. No factor carries any more weight than Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 12 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 13 any other, but rather its importance will depend on the specific facts and \ncircumstances of the individual case.” Id. at 403.  \nParo argues  that Paro and FirmKey are direct competitors, and that Kohan \nhas access to and knowledge of Paro’s Confidential Information when he was an \nemployee of Paro’s, and is a co -founder of  FirmKey. Memo. TRO at 4. Paro did not \naddress the near -permanence of its client relationships, or the time and restrictions \nplaced on the  Non-Compete restrictive covenant , in its brief. However, at the TRO \nhearing Paro, when asked, explained that although it is not an old company, Paro has \nlongstanding clients which are the res ult of countless people hours and other “sweat \nequity” to secure those client relationships. Paro also represents that it does business \nin all 50 states, and some business in Europe, such that the geographic scope of the \nNon-C ompete is reasonable. Finally, Paro describes Paro’s business as “niche” and \ncontends that the definition of “Business” in the Employment Agreement captures \nthe protection of a legitimate business interest of Paro, namely “the provision of \noutsourced financial services” and “substantially similar” services to those offered by \nParo. Paro defends the breadth of the Non-Compete restrictive covenant by \nreiterating that Kohan agreed to it  when he signed the Employment Agreement, and \nby maintaining that this restrictive covenant would not prohibit Kohan from finding \nemployment in the financial services industry generally.   \nIn response, Kohan and FirmKey insist  that FirmKey is not a competitor of \nParo’s. Specifically,  argue Kohan and FirmKey, u nlike Paro, FirmKey matches \ncompanies with accounting help , which differs from Paro’s business because Paro is Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 13 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 14 a matchmaking  service  for big accounting firm s that need help. Resp. at 3 –4. Kohan \nand FirmKey maintain that these are different businesses with different clients. I d. \nHowever, Kohan and FirmKey concede that FirmKey’s business, like Paro’s, is \na matchmaking business connecting clients with experts or vendors. See Resp. at 4. \nAt this preliminary stage, and without the benefit of evidence from the parties on the \nrespect ive businesses of either company , the Court accepts that Paro and FirmKey \nare competitors.  \nNext, and most importantly,  Kohan and FirmKey contend that the restrictive \ncovenant is too broad as to  both the prohibited activit y and the geographic scope, and \nalso because it is “insolubly ambiguous.” Resp. at 4 –6. Specifically, Kohan and \nFirmKey argue that the definition of “Busi ness” is overly broad and ambiguous . Id. \nat 4–5. Kohan and FirmKey argue  that, “if enforced, ” this restrictive covenant “would \nprevent Mr. Kohan from taking virtually any job in his chosen area of expertise.” Id. \nat 5 ( citing  cases).   \nThe Court agrees with Kohan and FirmKey that the scope of the restrictive \ncovenant is problematic.  Specifically, the Court finds “the provision of outsourced \nfinancial services” to be overbroad. The Court confirmed at the TRO hearing that the \nterm is not defined in the Employ ment Agreement. Breaking  down  the phrase  \noutsourced financial services , “outsource” is commonly defined as “(of a company or \norganization) to purchase (goods) or subcontract (services) from an outside supplier \nor source. ” Outsource, Dictionary.com , https://www.dictionary.com/browse/outsource \n(last visited July 18, 2023) . “Financial services” has an indefinite number of Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 14 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 15 meanings, and can include banking, brokerage, mortgages, credit cards, payment \nservices, real estate, taxes, accounti ng, bookkeeping, investments, and on and on. \nThis is corroborated by Paro’s Verified Complaint, which describes the financial \nservices it provides to clients as “from basic bookkeeping and accounting to highly \nspecialized corporate development and strategic advisory services.” Compl. ¶ 10. \nThus, the language in the Non-C ompete is capable of many meanings.  \nFurther, the definition of “Business”  articulated in the Employment \nAgreement also includes “the provision, development, marketing, sale or \nmaintenance o f products or services which are substantially similar ” to Paro’s. Agmt. \n¶ 4 (emphasis added). In its TRO Motion, Paro focuses on Kohan’s alleged breach of \nthe Non-Compete. But, as discussed above, the Court’s first inquiry must be whether \nthe restrictive covenant itself is reasonable. Notably, in its TRO Motion, Paro has not \nsupported the breadth of this specific Non-C ompete clause, or comparably broad \nclauses, with any case law. Conversely, Kohan and FirmKey identify several cases , \nincluding AssuredPartners, Inc. v. Schmitt, 44 N.E.3d 463, 471 (Ill. App. Ct. 2015)  \nwhich they contend support the proposition that scope of the challenged Non-\nCompete is overbroad. Resp. at 5 –6.  \nIn A ssuredPartners, the court found unreasonable a non- compete restri ctive \ncovenant which prohibited the employee, a wholesale insurance broker specializing \nin lawyers’ professional liability insurance, from working in professional liability \ninsurance anywhere in the United States or its territories. 44 N.E.3d at 472. The \ncourt focused on the fact there was no qualification in the restrictive covenant that Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 15 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 16 the restrictions were limited to the employee’s activities relating to the specific \nprofessional liability insurance practice he had developed during his prior \nemployment, but rather applied to all liability insurance practices. Id. Additionally, \nthe court was troubled by the broad geographic scope, which restricted the em ployee \nfrom working in his chosen field in the United States and its territories. This \nrestriction observed the court, would place an undue burden on him by forcing him to \nleave the country to work in the same field. Id. at 473. While there are differences  \nbetween the covenant in Assured Partners and the Non-C ompete in this case—\nnamely the length of the restriction being 28 months instead of 12 months —\nAssuredPartners supports the general proposition that restrictions on activities must \nbe narrowly tailored to protect only against activities that threaten the employer’s \ninterest. Id. Here, it is Paro’s position that Kohan worked on “the white label suite of \nclients,” which is primarily the larger companies and accounting firms, suggesting a \nlegitimate interest in protecting Paro against Kohan contacting or soliciting that \nsuite of customers, yet the Non-C ompete is a wholesale restriction on Kohan working \nat a competing business in any capacity for a period of one year. Notably, Paro has \nnot identified for the Court any case where a one- year, nationwide non- compete \nrestrictive covenant  has been upheld as enforceable.  \nThe Court also finds similarities between the covenant at issue in this case and \nthe covenant at issue in Oce N. Am. , Inc. v. Brazeau . 2009 WL 6056775 (N.D. Ill. Sept. \n4, 2009) , report and recommendation  adopted,  2010 WL 5033310 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 18, \n2010). In Oce, employees employed in non -sales or non -service capacities were Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 16 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 17 restricted from becoming “associated with, through ownership, employment, s elf-\nemployment, consultancy, contract or otherwise, any Competing Business.” Id.  at *4.  \nThe covenant was nationwide for a period of 12 months. Id. at *3. The court found the \ncovenant was not enforceable under Illinois law, noting that Illinois law disfavor s \nnon-competition clauses, which are closely examined, and the subject covenant was \noverly broad to secure any of the company’s protectable interests. Id. at *8. Further, \nthe court identified several cases where one- year, nationwide non-competition \nagreements  were found to be invalid, and noted that the plaintiff did  not point to any \ncase where a similar covenant had been upheld. Id. at *8 n.79 (collecting cases). \nFinally, the court stated  that “if the temporal and geographic restrictions on an \nemployee’ s conduct are broad, as they are here, the agreement ’s activity restrictions \nshould be correspondingly narrowly drawn to protect the employee ’s ability to be \nemployed in his chosen field.” I d.; see also Cambridge Engineering, Inc. v. Mercury \nPartners 90 BI, Inc. , 879 N.E.2d 512, 526, (Ill. App. Ct. 2007) (finding a “blanket bar \non all activities for competitors” to be excessive and unreasonable as a matter of law).   \nSo too here. Enforcement of the Non-C ompete would, in effect, preclude Kohan \nfrom working in any capacity in the industry in which Paro does business anywhere \nin the  United States, or other parts of the world where Paro has conducted business. \nAs counsel for  Paro stated during the  TRO hearing, it is Paro’s position that it plays \nin the entire “outsourced financial services” sandbox, marketing to companies of all \nsizes, including mom -and-pop shops, Fortune 500 companies, and some of the largest \naccounting firms in the United States.  Paro, however, concedes that Kohan was Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 17 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 26 following a bench trial. Id. In other words, like PepsiCo , the district court had the \nbenefit of an evidentiary record.  \nFurther, the Court notes that at least one other court in this District  has found \nthat for a claim under the Defend Trade Secrets Act, an inevitable disclosure theory \nis insufficient because the statute requires that the trade secret information actually \nbe misappropriated. Aon PLC v. Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. , 2023 WL 3914886, \nat *5 (N.D. Ill. June 9, 2023). Specifically, “[t]he civil remedies provision of [the \nDefend Trade Secrets Act]  precludes the imposition of injunctive relief for actual or \nthreatened misappropriation based ‘merely on the information the person knows.’” \nId. (quoting  18 U.S.C. § 1836(b)(3)(A)(i)(I)). Here, Paro concedes that it is no t \nproceeding on a  theory of actual misappropriation. Thus, for this independent reason, \nParo has not established a likelihood of success on its Defend Trade Secrets Act  claim.  \nAccordingly, at this early sta ge, the Court finds Paro has not established a \nlikelihood of success on the merits of its trade secrets claims. Paro concedes it is not \ncontending Kohan improperly accessed trade secrets at any point  during his \nemployment with Paro , or held on to that info rmation in violation of his Employment \nAgreement. Paro does not allege that Kohan or FirmKey has, in fact, used, disclosed, \nor relied upon any trade secret of Paro’s. Paro does argue that Paro and FirmKey are \ndirect competitors, and that Kohan cannot opera te or function in his new position \nwithout relying upon Paro’s trade secrets. In response, Kohan or FirmKey affirm, \nthrough a sworn Declaration of Kohan, that they do not possess any of Paro’s trade \nsecrets or confidential information. Kohan Decl. ¶ 8. Thi s is in sharp contrast to the Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 26 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 27 cases where ex -employees have downloaded or accessed trade secrets or confidential \ninformation from their ex -employer, and the ex -employer has proof of that action, \nwhich usually drives the filing of a lawsuit and seeking emer gency relief from the \nCourt. See, e.g., Aon Risk Services Companies, 415 F.Supp.3d at 848 (finding a \nlikelihood of success on trade secret claims where employees took trade secrets prior \nto leaving the company). Paro’s speculation that Kohan and FirmKey wi ll, at some \npoint, use the trade secrets is not sufficient at this emergency TRO  stage, and Paro \nhas not identified cases to support that such a finding of inevitable disclosure can be \nmade at the TRO  stage.  \nThus, at this preliminary stage, the Court finds Paro has not met its burden to \nshow a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits with respect to Count II or III \nof its Verified Complaint.  \niii. Tortious Interference with Contract Against FirmKey \n(Count IV)  \n \nParo also asserts a claim for tortious interference with contract (the \nEmployment Agreement between Paro and Kohan) against FirmKey only. To prove \ntortious interference with contract under Illinois law, Paro must show “(1) the \nexistence of a valid and enforceable contract between the plaintiff and another; (2) \nthe defendant's awareness of the contract; (3) the defendant ’s intentional and \nunjustified inducement of a breach of the contract; (4) a subsequent breach by the \nother, caused by the defendant ’s conduct; and (5) damages.” Hess v. Kanoski & \nAssociates, 668 F.3d 446, 454 (7th Cir. 2012).  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 27 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 28 Paro maintains that FirmKey has tortiously interfered with the Employment \nAgreement by employing Kohan, and via the formation of the company itself , in \nviolation of Section 4 of the Employment Agreement. Memo. TRO at 10. As confirmed \nwith Paro at the TRO hearing, FirmKey is not subject to the Employment Agreement. \nThus, to the extent Paro is alleging FirmKey will solicit Paro’s clients or experts, or \nthreatens to interfere with Paro’s client or expert relationships, or will \nmisappropriate Paro’s Confidential Information itself, those allegations are not based \nupon tortious interference with Kohan’s contract with Paro, and are not cognizable \nunder this theory.  \nIn response,  Kohan and FirmKey argue, without citation to any authority, that \na company cannot tortiously interfere with a contract. While it is true that an entity \ncannot be liable for interfering with its own contract, an entity can tortiously interfere \nwith contracts, and that is not a claim that can only be stated against an individual. \nSee Cox v. Calumet Public Schools District 132 , 180 F.  Supp.  3d 556, 564 (N.D. Ill. \n2016).  \n Nevertheless, based upon the Court’s finding that Paro has not demonstrated \na likelihood of success as to Counts I –III of its Verified Complaint, it follows that Paro \nhas also failed to meet its burden for Count IV. Specifically, the Court’s finding with \nrespect to the Non-C ompete restrictive covenant forecloses a likelihood of success on \nthe merits for the tortious interference claim. That is because, as confirmed by Paro \nat the TRO hearing, it is pursuing this theory based on Section 4 of the Employment \nAgreement.  Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 28 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 29 Thus, at this preliminary stage, the Court finds Paro has not met its burden t o \nshow a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits with respect to Count IV of its \nVerified Complaint.  \nAs Paro is required to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of its \nclaims to obtain injunctive relief, the analysis of the remaining req uirements for \ninjunctive relief is unnecessary. See, e.g., Abbott , 971 F.2d at  11 (“If the moving party \ncannot establish … these prerequisites, a court's inquiry is over and the injunction \nmust be denied.”) At this emergency TRO juncture, and on this recor d, Paro has not \nmet its burden regarding the first requirement for obtaining injunctive relief. \nHowever, this ruling is not a suggestion that Paro will not be able to satisfy that \nburden at a preliminary injunction hearing after the parties have the opport unity to \nobtain discovery, which is addressed below . See, e.g., U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 667 \nF.3d at 782.  \nII. Expedited Discovery  \n Last, the Court addresses Paro’s motion for expedited discovery. In its \nexpedited discovery motion, Paro requests that it be permitted to engage in discovery \nin connection with the emergency relief it is seeking. The Court agrees that certain \nexpedited discovery is appropriate in light of the scheduling a preliminary injunction \nhearing, so the  Court and the parties will have a fuller evidentiary record for that \nhearing. See Nobel Biocare USA, Inc. v. Lynch , 1999 WL 958501, at *4 (N.D.  Ill. Sept. \n15, 1999). However, this proposed discovery will be limited , and the Court will require Case: 1:23-cv-04430 Document #: 17 Filed: 07/19/23 Page 29 of 30 PageID #:<pageID> \n 30 \nthe parties to submit a proposed discovery schedule in advance of commencing \ndiscovery .   \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court resolves Paro’s motion [7] as foll ows: the \nCourt denies Paro’s request for an emergency temporary restraining order, and \nenters and continues Paro’s request for a preliminary injunction, to be resolved after \nlimited discovery and an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. The Court grants \nPlain tiff’s motion for expedited discovery [9], subject to the Court’s review of a \nproposed discovery schedule.  \nThe Court directs the parties to file a joint status report by July 24, 2023 \naddressing (i) proposed dates for an in -person preliminary injunction h earing, (ii) the \nanticipated length of a preliminary injunction hearing, (iii) the number of witnesses \nper side, and (iv) a proposed expedited discovery schedule, including the anticipated \nnumber of depositions per side, proposed number of interrogatories,  number of \nrequests to admit, and requests for production.  \n \n \nDated: July 19, 2023     \n____________________________________ \nUnited States District Judge  \nFranklin U.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In a class action against Arlo Technologies, Inc., the plaintiffs, delivery drivers in Illinois, allege that Arlo's home security systems violate the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by capturing and storing biometric data without informed consent or a public data retention policy. The court denied Arlo's motions to dismiss these claims and to strike supplemental authority, finding the allegations sufficient to establish standing and plausible claims under BIPA. This case involves AI as it pertains to Arlo's use of facial recognition and other AI-powered features to capture biometric data.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Arlo Technologies' capture and use of biometric data from its security systems without proper consent, collection, and retention policies violates BIPA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Arlo's motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Arlo's actions were subject to BIPA, thus allowing their claims to proceed. The court also found that plaintiffs had Article III standing.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Some delivery drivers are upset because they believe a company called Arlo is using its fancy security cameras to secretly capture and store information about their faces and bodies without asking permission. They say that Arlo is being sneaky because they don’t have a clear plan about how long they will keep this info or how they will eventually get rid of it. The court said, \"We’re not throwing this case out just yet,\" which means they'll get to find out if Arlo really did anything wrong.",

Id. \nArlo is a Delaware c orporation with a principal place of business in Milpitas, California.  \nId. ¶ 17.  Arlo is a home security company that offers security cameras supported by high quality \nvideo and artificial intelligence (“AI”) monitoring.  Id. \n2. Arlo’s Home Security System  \nPlaintiffs allege that every time an  Illinois delivery driver make s a food, mail, or package \ndelivery to a home that is equipped with Arlo’s home security system, Arlo’s security cameras \ncapture geometric scans of the driver’s face, body, and hands in both  the infrared and visible light \nspectra.  FAC ¶ 2.  The cameras can collect videos in the visible light spectrum in various high \nresolutions, including 1080p, 2K, HD, and 4K; some have color night vision as well.  Id. ¶ 26.  \nFurther, most Arlo devices dete ct motion using passive infrared (“PIR”) technology, which detects \nobjects that are warmer than the surrounding environment.  Id.  Arlo’s infrared facial recognition \ntechnology is even capable of distinguishing between individuals wearing glasses, whereas many \nother types of facial recognition technology struggle to identify individuals wearing sunglasses or \nbalaclavas.  Id. ¶ 4.  The combination and analysis of the scans in two spectra —infrared radiation \nand visible light —allows Arlo to identify particular individuals.  See id.  ¶ 27.  \nArlo’s home security systems do not include the full capabilities of its recognition \nsoftware, and it does not provide homeowners with software that can process the  camera scans to \nrecognize unique individuals.  FAC  ¶ 6.  However, Arlo does sell a “Person Detection” feature as \npart of its home security offerings.  See id.  ¶ 5.  The Person Detection feat ure uses artificial \nintelligence (“AI”) technology and uses advanced algorithms to analyze the infrared and visible \nlight scans collected by Arlo’s cameras to: (1) distinguish between humans and animals; (2) filter \nout everyday movement (such as tree branc hes) and provide real -time alerts to the homeowner \nwhen a person is detected approaching the home; and (3) allow the homeowner to search the \ncamera video feeds for videos containing people.  See id.  ¶¶ 5, 24.   \nIn addition to the Person Detection feature, Arlo sells homeowners  the following features : Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 2 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

Homeowners may activate or deactivate these features by toggling a motion alert setting \nfor each category in the Arlo app.  Id. \nPlaintiffs allege that the scans that Arlo can use to identify unique individuals are \nbiometric identifie rs, and Arlo’s AI needs to collect, use, and  store such biometric identifiers  to \naccomplish its various person detection tasks.  See id.  ¶¶ 2, 5, 26.  In particular, Plaintiffs allege \nthat the Person Detection feature necessarily requires the collection of  people’s facial, body, and \nhand geometry  in both the infrared and visible light spectra to reliably  distinguish people from \nanimals.   See i d. ¶ 5, 26.  \nArlo did not inform Plaintiffs that it was collecting biometric identifiers, or of the purpose \nand length of time for which their biometric identifiers would be collected, stored, and  used.  See \nFAC ¶ 43.  Further, Arlo did not publish public access policies identifying its retention schedules \nor guidelines for permanently destroying  any of these biomet ric identifiers.   Id. ¶ 44.  \n3. Arlo’s Presence in Market  \nArlo is one of the largest players in the home security market in the United States.  FAC ¶ \n21.  According to its most recent investor report, Arlo generated $490 million in revenue in 2022 \nand had a pa rticularly strong 53% year -over-year growth in the last quarter of 2022.  Id.  \n4.

LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion to Dismiss  FAC  \n1. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) permits a defendant to challenge the existence of \nthe Court’s subject matter jurisdiction over the action.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  “Federal \ncourts are courts of limited jurisdiction  . . .  possess [ing]  only that power authorized by \nConstitution and statute.”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am. , 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).   \nArticle III of the United States Constitution “ limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to ‘Cases ’ and \n‘Controversies .’”  Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 559 (1992).  The party invoking \nfederal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing that  the plaintiff has standing to bring the suit, \ni.e., that  the action is a case or controversy “ of the justiciable sort referred to  in Article III .”  Id. at \n560–61.  “[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements .”  Id. at \n560.  “ The plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the \nchallenged conduct of the defendan t, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 4 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

Robins , 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (citations omitted).  “[A] t the \npleading stage, the plaintiff must ‘clearly . . . allege facts demonstrating ’ each element. ”  Id. \n(quoting Warth v. Seldin , 442 U.S. 490, 518 (1975)).  \n2. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must dismiss a complaint if it fails \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rul e 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff \nmust allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads facts \npermitting the court t o “draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted).  The \nallegations must show “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id.  \nMere “conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a \nmotion to dismiss.”  Adams v. Johnson , 355 F.3d 1179, 1183 (9th Cir. 2004).  \nWhen determining whether a claim has been stated, a district court's review is limited to \nthe face of the complaint and judicially noticeable information.  MGIC Indem. Corp. v. Weisman , \n803 F.2d 500, 504 (9th Cir. 1986); N. Star Int'l v. Ariz. Corp. Comm’n , 720 F.2d 578, 581 (9th \nCir. 1983).  The court must accept as true all well -pleaded factual allegations and construe them in \nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Reese v. BP Expl. (Alaska) Inc. , 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th \nCir. 2011).  The Court need no t, however, “assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because \nthey are cast in the form of factual allegations.”  Fayer v. Vaughn , 649 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. \n2011) (per curiam).  \nB. Motion to Strike Notice of Supplemental Authority  \nA district court may in its discretion strike a filing for failure to comply with the local \nrules.  See Christian v. Mattel, Inc. , 286 F.3d 1118, 1129 (9th Cir. 2002) ( “The district court has \nconsiderable latitude in managing the parties' motion practice and enforcing local ru les that place \nparameters on briefing. ”); see also, e.g. , Hudson v.

DISCUSSION  \nBecause Defendant’s Motion to Strike concerns a Notice of Supplemental Authority \nPlaintiffs filed in support of their opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, the Court \naddresses the Motion to Str ike first.  \nA. Motion to Strike  \nDefendant moves the Court to strike Plaintiffs’ Notice of Supplemental Authority , see ECF \nNo. 44,  filed on April 30, 2024.  See Strike Mot. 1.  Defendant argues that the filing violate s Civil \nLocal Rule 7 -3(d) because it include s about 1.5 pages of argument regarding the supplemental \nauthority at issue, and requests that the Court either (1) “deny Plaintiffs’ request that the \nimproperly submitted supplemental authority be considered in ruling on Arlo’s pending Motion to \nDismiss” or (2) grant Defendant leave to file a proposed 1.5 -page response to the argument set \nforth in Plaintiffs’ filing.  See id.   Plaintiffs counter that  (1) the Notice does not contain argument, \nbut instead directly quote s the new authority, and (2) even if the Court consider s the filing to \ncontain argument, the sum total of Plaintiffs’ opposition papers to the Motion to Dismiss would be \n18 pages and thus well below the 25 -page limit for opposition briefs.  See Strike Opp’n 1.  \nThe Court finds that Pl aintiffs’ April 30, 2024 Notice of Supplemental Authority violates \nthis district’s local rules, which require a party to provide no more than a citation and copy of the \ndecision at issue.  See Civil L.R. 7 -3(d)(2).  However, the  Court has not reviewed and will not \nreview the text of Plaintiff’s filing.  The  Court will in its discretion consider Plaintiffs to have filed \na compliant statement of recent decision, and will consider only the copy of the decision attached Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 6 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

The Court therefo re DENIES  Defendant’s request that the Court refuse to \nconsider the supplemental authority.1  Further, because the Court is not considering Plaintiff’s \nadditional text, it also DENIES  Defendant’s request for leave to file a proposed response.  \nB. Motion to Di smiss  \nPlaintiffs assert BIPA claims for violations of 740 ILCS 14/15(b) ( “Claim 1 ” or “Section \n15(b)” ) and 740 ILCS 14/15(a) ( “Claim 2 ” or “Section 15(a)” ).  See FAC ¶¶ 52 –75.  Sections \n15(a) and (b) of BIPA provide:  \n \n(a) A private entity in possession of biom etric identifiers or biometric \ninformation must develop a written policy, made available to the \npublic, establishing a retention schedule and guidelines for \npermanently destroying biometric identifiers and biometric \ninformation when the initial purpose for  collecting or obtaining \nsuch identifiers or information has been satisfied or within 3 years \nof the individual's last interaction with the private entity, \nwhichever occurs first. Absent a valid warrant or subpoena issued \nby a court of competent jurisdicti on, a private entity in possession \nof biometric identifiers or biometric information must comply \nwith its established retention schedule and destruction guidelines.  \n \n(b) No private entity may collect, capture, purchase, receive through \ntrade, or otherwise obta in a person's or a customer's biometric \nidentifier or biometric information, unless it first:  \n \n(1) informs the subject or the subject's legally authorized \nrepresentative in writing that a biometric identifier or \nbiometric information is being collected or stored;  \n \n(2) informs the subject or the subject's legally authorized \nrepresentative in writing of the specific purpose and length of \nterm for which a biometric identifier or biometric information \nis being collected, stored, and used; and  \n \n(3) receives  a written release executed by the subject of the \nbiometric identifier or biometric information or the subject's \nlegally authorized representative.  \n \n740 ILCS 14/15(a).  \nArlo moves to dismiss both counts of the FAC on the grounds that (1) Plaintiffs lack \nArticle III standing for Claim 2 and therefore cannot invoke federal jurisdiction over the claim, \n \n1 The Court notes that both Defendant and Plaintiffs subsequently filed further statements of \nrecent decisions.  See ECF Nos. 46, 48.  Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 7 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT. DISMISS FAC; MOT. STRIKE NOT. SUPPL.

See generally \nMot.  The Court addresses these arguments in turn.  \n1. Standing  \nPlaintiffs have the burden to establish Article III standing by sufficiently alleging that they \nhave  “(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the \ndefendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo , 578 \nU.S. at 338 (citations omitted) .  The injury in fact element req uires Plaintiffs to allege “ an invasion \nof a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized; and (b) actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural or hypothetical .”  Patel v. Facebook, Inc. , 932 F.3d 1264, 1270 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Lujan , 504 U.S. at 560).   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs fail to establish  an injury in fact  \nbecause they have not alleged a concrete and particularized injury .  See Mot. 6 –7; Reply 12 –13. \nThe Ninth Circuit has “adopted a two -step approach to determine whether th e violation of \na statute causes a concrete injury.”  Patel , 932 F.3d at  1270.  Under this approach, courts should \n“ask ‘(1) whether the statutory provisions at issue were established to protect the plaintiff ’s \nconcrete interests (as opposed to purely proce dural rights), and if so, (2) whether the specific \nprocedural violations alleged in this case actually harm, or present a material risk of harm to, such \ninterests.”   Id. at 1270 –71 (quoting Robins v. Spokeo, Inc. , 867 F.3d 1108, 1113 ( 9th Cir. 2017)) \n(internal brackets omitted).  \nIn Patel , the Ninth Circuit applied the two -step approach to determine whether plaintiffs \nhad standing to bring BIPA claims against Facebook for alleged violations of Section s 15(a) and \n(b), i.e., the same statutes at issue in this  action.  See id.  at 1268 (“ According to the complaint, \nFacebook violated sections 15(a) and 15(b) of BIPA by collecting, using, and storing biometric \nidentifiers (a ‘scan’ of ‘face geometry, ’ []) from their photos without obtaining a written release \nand w ithout establishing a compliant retention schedule. ”) (internal citation omitted).  At the first \nstep, the circuit court held that Sections 15(a) and (b) “were established to protect an individual’s \n‘concrete interests’ in privacy, not merely procedural ri ghts.”  Id. at 1274 (citing Robins , 867 F.3d \nat 1113).  The court then turned to the second step of the analysis and found that the defendant’s Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 8 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

Id. at 1275.  The Ninth Circuit \nconclude d that the Patel  plaintiffs’ allegations that Facebook’s violations of the BIPA \nrequirements allowed it to create, use, and retain individuals’ face templates “necessarily \nviolate[d] the plaintiffs’ substantive privacy interests,” so that the plaintiffs ha d alleged a concrete \nand particularized harm sufficient to establish the injury -in-fact element for Article III standing  for \nthe alleged violations of Sections 15(a) and (b) .  See id.  at 1274 –75. \nThe Ninth Circuit recently clarified that  although BIPA esta blishes concrete interests in \nprivacy,  the mere failure to “ provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying \nthe biometric identifiers and/or biometric information ” is not sufficient to state an injury to a \nparticular person, as oppose d to the public generally.  See Zellmer v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , --- \nF.4th ----, 2024 WL 3016946, at *8 (9th Cir. June 17, 2024) (citing Bryant v. Compass Grp. USA, \nInc., 958 F.3d 617, 626 (7th Cir. 2020); Fox v. Dakkota Integrated Sys., LLC , 980 F.3d 1146 , \n1154 –55 (7th Cir. 2020) ).  The court noted that its decision did not contradict Patel  because the \nplaintiffs in Patel , unlike those in Zellmer , had sufficiently alleged a violation of Section 15(b), \nfrom which they could show “direct and discrete harm fr om the alleged Section 15(a) violation.”  \nId. (citing Patel , 932 F.3d at 1275 –76). \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs do not have standing for their Section 15(a) claim because \nthey allege only a failure to publish a retention policy .  See Mot. 6 –7 (citing Bryant , 958 F.3d at \n626; Fox, 980 F.3d at 1154 –55); Reply 12 –13.2  However, upon review of the FAC in the light \nmost favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court finds that Plaintiffs allege that Arlo (1) collected biometric \nidentifiers in the form of geometric scans of Plaintiffs’ faces, bodies, and hands, see FAC ¶ 5; (2)  \nused these scans to provide various home security features, including Person Detection, see id. ¶ \n26; (3)  “failed to develop a publicly available retention schedule or guidelines for permanently \n \n2 Defendant submitted its Motion and Reply prior to the Ninth Circuit’s Zellmer  decision.

These allegations , along with the Court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs have \nsufficiently stated a vi olation of Section 15(b), see infra , at Part III(B)(2), are sufficient to state a \ntheory of concrete and particularized harm in violation of Section 15(a): namely, that Arlo has \ncollected, used, and stored Plaintiffs’ biometric information without the prop er procedures —a \nretention policy and compliance therewith —to safeguard Plaintiffs’ substantive privacy interests.  \nSee Patel , 932 F.3d at 1274 –75; Zellmer , 2024 WL 3016946 , at *8.  \n2. Sufficiency of Allegations to State a Claim  \nArlo next argues that both of Pl aintiffs’ claims must be dismissed for failure to state a \nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6).   See Mot. 7 –23.  Arlo first argues that that both BIPA claims fail for \ntwo common reasons:  (1) Plaintiffs do not allege facts suggesting that they were recorded by an \nArlo camera equipped with the relevant detection features; and (2) Plaintiffs do not sufficiently \nallege that Arlo collected biometric identifiers.  See Mot. 8 –17.  Arlo then argues that the Section \n15(b) claim fails because the statute does not apply to the conduct at issue here, see id.  at 17 –21, \nand that the Section 15(a) claim fails because Arlo is in compliance with the statute and because \nArlo does not “possess” Plaintiffs’ biometric data under the meaning of the statute, see id.  at 21 –\n23.  The Court addresses these arguments in turn.  \na. Recordings by Arlo Cameras  \nDefendant argues that the FAC does not plausibly allege that Plaintiffs made deliveries to \nany home in Illinois at which an Arlo camera was installed with the necessary features to capture \nthe scans at issue in this action.  See Mot. 8 –10; see also  Reply 2  (arguing Plaintiffs’ claims are \npremised on “pure speculation” that they have been captured by Arlo cameras in Illinois) .  \nPlaintiffs respond that these arguments raise factual questions not appropriate for resolution on a \nmotion to dismiss.  See Opp’n 4 –6. \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs.  The FAC  acknowledges that Plaintiffs are “unable to \ndetermine which houses have such surveillance[] systems in place,” FAC ¶ 56, but  alleges that Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 10 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

BIPA provides that “‘ [b]iometric \nidentifier ’ means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry ,” \nand goes on to list various items, such as tattoos or human biological samples used for scientific \ntesting, that are not “biometric identifiers” covered by  BIPA.   Id. at 14/10.  “‘ Biometric \ninformation ’ means any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, \nbased on an individual's biometric identifier used to identify an individual. ”  Id.   \nArlo argues that the FAC does not s tate a claim under BIPA because Plaintiffs do not \nallege that Arlo’s infrared or visible light scans (1) can be used by Arlo to identify Plaintiffs, see \nMot. 14 –17, and (2) fall into the definition of “ a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or sca n \nof hand or face geometry ,” but rather that Arlo’s scans are “heat maps,” which are not included in \nBIPA’s enumerated list of biometric identifiers,  see id. at 17.  Plaintiffs counter that the FAC \nplausibly alleges that Arlo collects biometric identifiers  by capturing geometric scans of an \nindividual’s face and hands , which can be used to identify Plaintiffs .  See Opp’n 6 –11. \nAddressing the second argument first, Plaintiffs allege that the scans taken by Arlo’s \ncameras capture infrared and visible light da ta that Arlo’s technology then uses to “map[] pe oples’ \nfacial geometry.”  FAC ¶ 31; see also, e.g. , id. ¶ 2 (“Defendant’s security cameras capture \ngeometric scans of Plaintiffs and other Illinois delivery drivers’ faces, bodies, and hands.”).  \nTaking these  allegations as true, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged the necessary —\nalthough not sufficient —fact that Arlo captures data included on BIPA’s list of biometric \nidentifiers, namely, “scan[s] of hand or face geometry.”  \nIn addition to alleging data  included on the BIPA list, the Ninth Circuit has clarified that \nboth biometric identifiers and biometric information must be capable of identifying an individual \nto be regulated by BIPA.  See Zellmer , 2024 WL 3016946, at *4.   Thus, “[f]or example, scans o f \nface geometry fall within BIPA's list, but are not covered by BIPA if they cannot identify a Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 12 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

In Zellmer , the Ninth Circuit held on review of summary judgment that a “face \nsignature” that did not reveal any geometric information abou t a face or correspond to facial \nfeatures —and instead was an abstract, numerical representation that could not be reverse -\nengineered to display a face —was not a biometric identifier.  See id.  at *6.  By contrast, Plaintiffs \nhere allege that “Arlo’s patents confirm that these . . . scans . . . can be used to identify particular \nindividuals.”  FAC ¶ 6; see also id.  ¶ 32 (“Arlo boasts that ‘the invention provides a new and \nuseful facial recognition system  that may further automatically execute tasks in response to the \ndetection of a particular individual.’”).  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs must allege that Arlo itself is capable of using the scans to \ndetermine Plaintiffs’ identities —e.g., their names, ph one numbers, email addresses —and that the \nFAC instead alleges an implausible hypothetical situation in which Arlo could use its facial \nrecognition technology to match Plaintiffs’ faces to their photos on public facing social media \nprofiles.  See Mot. 16; F AC ¶¶ 64 –65.4  But these are not Plaintiffs’ only allegations regarding \nArlo’s capacity to identify individuals using its scans.  Plaintiffs allege that Arlo has explained in a \nEuropean patent  that its face recognition technology can identify a specific p erson at a door and \nsend a user a message such as “Mary detected at front door” or, conversely, inform a user of \n“Unknown person at front door.”  FAC ¶ ¶ 28, 32.  Arlo argues that the European patent is not \nrelevant here, but the Court takes as true Plainti ffs’ allegation that the same scans are used in \nArlo’s home security cameras .  See id.  ¶ 27.  Plaintiffs further allege that “Defendant’s cameras \ncollected Plaintiffs’ face geometry and stored the image of Plaintiffs’ face geometry in an \nelectronic databas e” whenever Plaintiffs made deliveries to homes equipped with Arlo cameras.  \nThe Court finds these allegations sufficient to establish at the pleading stage that the scans Arlo \n \n4 Plaintiffs argue that biometric identifiers are distinct from biometric information under BIPA, so \nthat biometric identifiers need not be capable of being used to identify an individual, but the Ninth \nCircuit rejected this argument in Zellmer  (decided subsequent to Plaintiffs’ submission of their \nopposition brief). See Opp’n 11; Zellmer , 2024 WL 3016946, at *4  (“We join the other courts to \nhave considered this issue and reject Zellmer’s argument” that “while biometric information \nrequires the ability to ‘identify an individual,’ biometric identifiers have no such explicit \nrequirement.’”).

Section 15(b)  Arguments  \nArlo next argues that Plaintiffs do not state a claim under Section 15(b) because (1) \nPlaintiffs do not allege that Arlo actively collected their biometric data, but rather that Arlo \npassively captured scans only after homeowners activated the Person Detec tion feature, see Mot. \n17–19, and (2) Section 15(b) does not require impossible notice and consent from individuals who \nare strangers to Arlo, id. at 20 –21.   \nThe Court finds Arlo’s first argument thoroughly unpersuasive.  Contrary to Arlo’s \nposition, Plai ntiffs do not “claim their ‘infrared scans’ were collected by ‘homeowners.’”  See \nMot. 18.  It is plainly not Plaintiffs’ theory that homeowners are collecting and storing the scans of \nindividuals who arrive at their doors.  Rather, Plaintiffs expressly al lege that Arlo’s cameras scan \nthe faces, bodies, and hands of visitors to homes equipped with Arlo’s home security system, see \nFAC ¶ 2; that Arlo then stores the scans in an electronic database, see id. ¶¶ 28, 42; and that if a \nhomeowner activates a featur e such as Person Detection, then Arlo alerts the homeowner when a \nperson is detected by the camera, see id.  ¶ 24.  These allegations are sufficient to establish that \n \n5 The Wise  decision also notes that the complaint alleged that the defendant partnered with law \nenforcement agencies to semi -automatically identify individuals based on face recognition, but \nthat allegation was not dispositive.

See, e.g. ,  Jacobs v. Hanwha Techwin Am., Inc. , \n2021 WL 3172967, at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 27, 2021) (“[F]or §  15(b)’s requirements to apply, an \nentity must, at a minimum, take an active step to collect, captu re, purchase, or otherwise obtain \nbiometric data .”) \nArlo’s  second  argument  specific to Section 15(b) —i.e., that it is too far removed from \nPlaintiffs, such that it would be practically impossible to provide notice and obtain consent —relies \non the district court’s decision in Zellmer v. Facebook, Inc. , No. 18 -cv-01880, 2022 WL 976981 \n(N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2022).  However, on appeal, the Ninth Circuit  stated that the district court’s \ndecision “ turned on the practical impossibility of Meta ’s complying with BIPA if it had to obtain \nconsent from everyone whose photo was uploaded to Facebook ,” but that “this conclusion was \nwrong” because “the plain text applies to everyone whose biometric identifiers or information is \nheld by Facebook.”  Zellmer , 2024 WL 3016946, at  *4.  Arlo’s second argument —made before \nthe Ninth Circuit’s issuance of Zellmer —must therefore be rejected.  \nd. Section 15(a) Arguments  \nArlo lastly argues that Plaintiffs’ Section 15(a) claim must be dismissed because (1) Arlo \nhas a publicly available policy that complies with the retention periods set forth in Section 15(a); \n(2) Plaintiffs lack statutory standing to bring the claim becaus e they were not themselves \naggrieved by Arlo’s alleged violation of the retention policy because Arlo’s retention duty is owed \nto the public at large rather than individuals; and (3) Plaintiffs fail to allege that Arlo “possessed” \ntheir biometric data.  See Mot. 21 –23.  These arguments are unavailing.  \nFirst, the policy put forth by Arlo —of which the Court has taken judicial notice, see supra , \nat 11 n.3 —does not address Section 15(a)’s requirement that companies “ develop a written policy, \nmade available to t he public, establishing a retention schedule and guidelines for permanently \ndestroying biometric identifiers and biometric information .”  740 ILCS 14/15(a).  Instead, the \npolicy states that “Arlo permanently and immediately deletes videos after a subscribe r deletes a \nvideo, or after expiration of the applicable retention period for the subscription plan of the Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 15 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

Jud. Not, Exh. 6.  Regardless of the truth of this statement —which the \nCourt does not consider —the policy does not discuss bio metric identifiers and biometric \ninformation, particularly as Plaintiffs allege that Arlo stores the scans at issue in an electronic \ndatabase.  See FAC ¶ 42 ; see also Rivera v. Google, Inc. , 238 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1096 (N.D. Ill. \n2017) (“ The bottom line is that a ‘biometric identifier ’ is not the underlying medium itself , or a \nway of taking measurements, but instead is a set of measurements of a specified physical \ncomponent (eye, finger, voice, hand, face) used to identify a perso n.”) (emphasis added).  \nSecon d, Arlo’s argument that Plaintiffs lack statutory standing  (as distinct from Article III \nstanding)  must also be  rejected .  BIPA provides that “[a]ny person aggrieved by a violation of \n[BIPA] shall have a right of action in a State circuit court or as a sup plemental claim in federal \ndistrict court against an offending party.”  740 ILCS 14/20.  Arlo relies on a Seventh Circuit \ndecision finding that the plaintiff lacked  Article III standing to bring a Section 15(a) claim because \nan entity’s policy disclosure d uty was “owed to the public generally, not to particular persons \nwhose biometric data the entity collects.”  Mot. 22 (quoting Bryant , 958 F.3d at 626).  However, \nthe Seventh Circuit specifically stated that given its finding as to Article III standing, it had “ no \nauthority and no occasion to address her state -court standing to bring this claim .”  Bryant , 658 \nF.3d at 626.  Here, the Court has found that Plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring their \nSection 15(a) claim under Ninth Circuit law because th ey have sufficiently alleged a concrete and \nparticularized injury.  See supra , at Part III(B)(1).  For the same reasons, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have alleged that they are “aggrieved” by the violation of Section 15(a).  \nThird, Arlo argues that Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege its “possession” of their \nbiometric data, i.e., that Arlo had control of the biometric data, as opposed to the homeowners .  \nSee Mot. 22 –23.  But the FAC plainly alleges that Arlo “stored and use d” biometric identifiers to o \nprovide its Person Detection feature, FAC ¶ 12, and that Arlo is unable to accomplish its person \ndetection tasks without “collect[ing], us[ing], and stor[ing]” the identifiers, id. ¶ 26.  The FAC \nfurther alleges that Arlo store s the biometric data in an electronic database, see id.  ¶ 42, and that \nhomeowners can toggle features such as Person Detection on and off.  See id. ¶ 25.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a class action lawsuit against Clearview AI, Inc., and related defendants, alleging violations under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) as well as various state laws. Plaintiffs claim Clearview AI unlawfully collected, analyzed, and sold biometric information scraped from internet images using artificial intelligence algorithms. The court partially granted and partially denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, upholding most of the plaintiffs' claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the use of artificial intelligence by Clearview AI to collect and analyze individuals' biometric data without consent violates BIPA and constitutes an infringement of privacy rights under various state laws.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion to dismiss most of the claims, finding that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged violations of privacy laws, particularly emphasizing the misuse of biometric data obtained through AI technology. The court ruled that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged claims under BIPA and other state laws, except for the New York unjust enrichment claim which was preempted by existing law.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if someone secretly took your unique fingerprints and face features from photos you posted online and put them in a giant database without telling you. Then, they made this powerful tool that can recognize people just by uploading any photo, and they sold access to this tool to other people. That's sort of what Clearview AI is accused of doing with people's face data using very smart computer algorithms. The court mostly decided that people have a right to protect this kind of personal data and that Clearview should face the lawsuit for potentially breaking privacy laws.",

Plaintiffs bring \nclaims under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”) , as well \nas statutory and common la w claims under Virginia, California, and New York  law.  Before the \nCourt is  the Clearview defendants’  motion to dismiss under Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure \n12(b)( 1) and 12(b)(6) .  For the following reasons,  the Court  grants in part and denies in part the \nClearview defendants’ motion.   \nBackground  \n \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its prior rulings in this multi -district litigation.  In their \nfirst amended consolidated class action complaint, pl aintiffs a llege that the Clearview defendants’ \nconduct violated their privacy rights and that defendants’ use of their biometric information was \nwithout their knowledge and consent.  Plaintiffs  specifically  allege  that the Clearview defendants \ncovertly scraped over three  billion photographs of facial images from the internet and then used \nartificial intelligence algorithms to scan the face geometry of each individual depicted  to harvest the \nindividuals’ unique biometric identifiers and corresponding biometric information.    \nThe centerpiece of this multi -district litigation and plaintiffs’ class action lawsuit is  BIPA.   \nThe Illinois General Assembly “ enacted BIPA in 2008 in response to the growing use of biometrics Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 1 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n ‘in the business and security screening sectors .’”  Fox v. Dakkota Integrated Sys., LLC,  980 F.3d 1146, \n1149 ( 7th Cir. 2020)  (quoting 740 ILCS 14/5).  The legislative findings include: \nBiometrics are unlike other unique identifiers that are used to access finances or \nother sensitive information.  For example, s ocial security numbers, when \ncompromised, can be changed.  Biometrics, however, are  biologically  unique  to the \nindividual; therefore, once compromised, the individual has no recourse, is at \nheightened risk for identity theft, and is likely to withdraw from  biometric -facilitated \ntransactions.  \n \n740 ILCS 14/5(c).  The Illinois General Assembly further concluded that  “[t]he public welfare, \nsecurity, and safety will be served by regulating the collection, use, safeguarding, handling, storage, \nretention, and destruction of biometric identifiers and information.”   740 ILCS 14/5(g).  \nThe Illinois Supreme Court has explained that through BIPA , “our General Assembly has \ncodified that individuals possess a right to privacy in and control over their bi ometric identifiers and \nbiometric information.”  Rosenbach v. Six Flags Ent m’t Corp ., 129 N.E.3d 1197, 1206, 432 Ill.Dec. 654, \n663, 2019 IL 123186, ¶ 33 ( Ill. 2019) .  As the Seventh Circuit has noted, BIPA “ is designed to \nprotect consumers against the threat of irreparable privacy harms, identity theft, and other economic \ninjuries arising from the increasing use of biometric identifiers and information by private entities.”   \nBryant v. Compass Group USA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, 619 ( 7th Cir. 2020) . \nLegal Sta ndards  \nA Rule  12(b)(1) motion challenges federal jurisdiction, including Article III standing, and the \nparty invoking jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the elements necessary for subject matter \njurisdiction, including standing .

Skinner v. Switzer , 562 U.S. 521, 529, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 L.Ed.2d  \n233 (2011).  When considering dismissal of a complaint, t he Court accepts all well -pleaded factual \nallegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 \nU.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam ).  To survive a motion to dismiss, \nplaint iff must “state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 \nU.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).  A complaint is facially plausible when the \nplaintiff alleges  enough “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”   Ashcroft  v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. \n1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) . \nDiscu ssion  \nFirst Amendment  \nThe Court starts with the parties’ First A mendment arguments , keeping in mind that state \nstatutes are presumed constitutional .  Heller v. Doe by Doe , 509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637 , 125 \nL.Ed.2d 257 ( 1993) .  The Supreme Court recognizes that First Amendment protections and state -\nprotected privacy interests  can clash .  See The Fl orida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524, 533, 109 S.Ct. 2603, \n105 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).  As the Florida Star  Court reasoned, “ the sensitivity and significance of the \ninterests presented in clashes  between First Amendment and privacy rights counsel relying on \nlimited principles that sweep no more broadly than the appropriate context of the instant case.”  Id . \nat 533.  Accordingly, a t this stage of the proceedings, the C ourt must review pla intiffs’ allegations in \ndetail and examine the First Amendment arguments narrowly in order to strike a balance between \nprivacy interests and the interests protected by the First Amendment.

Phelps , 562 \nU.S. 443, 462, 131 S.Ct. 1207, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011)  (Breyer, J., concurrence).  \nViewing plaintiffs’ allegations as true  and in their favor , plaintiffs  allege the Clearview \ndefen dants covertly scraped over three billion photographs of facial images from the internet and Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 3 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n then used artificial intelligence algorithms to scan the face geometry of each photograph to harvest \nthe individuals’ unique biometric identifiers  and information.  Clearview then created a searchable \ndatabase containing th is biometric  information and data that allow s users to identify unknown \nindividuals by uploading a photograph to the database.  The database can be searched remotely by \nlicensed users of Clearview ’s web ap plication.  Plaintiffs further a llege that t he Clearview defendants \nhave collected, captured, or otherwise obtained their biometric data without notice and consent , and \nthereafter , sold or otherwise  profited from their biometric information.  \nHere , the Clearview defendants maintain that the capture of faceprints from public images \nand Clearview’s analysis of the public faceprints is protected speech , and thus , BIPA violates the \nFirst Amendment by inhibiting Clearview’s ability to collect  and analyze  public information.  See  \nSorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 570, 131 S.Ct. 2653, 180 L.Ed.2d 544 (2011)  (“This Court has \nheld that the creation and dissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the First \nAmendment .”).  Plaintiffs , however, assert that the capturing of faceprints and the action of \nextracting private  biometric identifiers from the faceprints is unprotected conduct.  See Rumsfeld  v. \nForum  for Acad.  & Institutional  Rights,  Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 66, 126 S. Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed. 2d 156 (2006).   \nThe Clearview defendants’ argument oversimplifies plaintiffs’ allegations.  A lthough \nClearview capture s public photographs from the internet, according to plaintiffs ’ allegations, \nClearview then harvests an individual’s unique biometric identifiers  and information—which are not \npublic information— without the individual’s consent.  Put differently, plaintiffs assert  that t he \nClearview defendants’ business model is not based on the collection of public photographs from the \ninternet , some source code, and republishing information via a search engine, but the additional \nconduct of harvesting nonpublic, personal biometric data.  And, a s plaintiffs fu rther allege, u nlike \nfingerprints, facial biometrics are readily observable and  present a grave and immediate danger to Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 4 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n privacy, individual autonomy, and liberty .  See Fox , 980 F.3d at 1155 ( biometric identifiers  \n“are immutable , and once compromised, are compromised forever ”). \nAccordingly, Clearview’s process in creating its database involves both speech and \nnonspeech elements .  When these “ elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a \nsufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify  \nincidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms .”  U nited States v. O ’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 \nS.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968) .  Under the se circumstances, the Court applies the intermediate \nscrutiny  standard elucidated  in O’Brien , namely, a regulation does not violate the First Amendment if \n(1) it is within the power of the government  to enact , (2) furthers an important government interest, \n(3) the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and (4) any \ninciden tal restriction on speech is no greater than is necessary to further th e government interest.  Id . \nat 377;  Foxxxy Ladyz Adult World, Inc. v. Village of Dix, Ill., 779 F.3d 706, 712 ( 7th Cir. 2015) . \nThe parties do not discuss the power of the Illinois General Assembly to enact BIPA , \ntherefore, the Court turns to the second O’Brien  prong .  The G eneral Assembly enacted BIPA to \nprotect Illinois  residents’ highly sensitiv e biometric information from unauthorized collection and \ndisclosure.  See  740 ILCS 14/5(c) ; Rosenbach,  129 N.E.3d at 1206.   Next, BIPA , including its \nexceptions, does not restrict a pa rticular viewpoint  nor target public discussion of an entire topic  \nunder the third O’Brien  requirement .  See Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz ., 576 U.S. 155, 169, 135 S.Ct. \n2218, 192 L.Ed.2d 236 (2015) ; Dahlstrom v. Sun -Times Media, LLC , 777 F.3d 937, 944 n.5 ( 7th Cir. \n2015) .  Under O’Brien’s  fourth factor, BIPA is narrowly tailored by legitimately protec ting Illinois \nresidents’ highly  sensitive biometric information and data, yet allow ing residents to share their \nbiometric  information through its consent provision.   See, e.g., People v. Austin , 155 N.E.3d 439, 468, \n440 Ill.Dec. 669, 698, 2019 IL 123910, ¶ 93 (Ill. 2019) (discussing Illinois’ revenge porn statute ).  \nLast, BIPA is not overly -broad.  See Center for Individual Freedom v. Madigan , 697 F.3d 464, 471 ( 7th Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 5 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n Cir. 2012) (“A st atute is facially overbroad only when ‘it prohibits a substantial amount of protected \nspeech.’”) (quoting  United  States  v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 \n(2008) ).  The Court denies defendants’ motion to dismiss in this respect.   \nExtraterritoria lity Doctrine  \nThe Court next turns to the Clearview defendants’ contention that plaintiffs’ BIPA claims \nviolate Illinois’ extraterritoriality doctrine.  Because BIPA does not expressly intend to operate \nextraterritorially, the alleged BIPA violations must have taken place in Illinois.  See Avery  v. State  Farm  \nMut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 216 Ill.2d 100, 296 Ill.Dec. 448, 835 N.E.2d 801, 852 ( Ill. 2005) .  In Avery , the \nIllinois Supreme Court concluded that “there is no single formula or bright -line test for determining \nwhether a transaction occurs within thi s state.”  Id . at 187.  The critical question is whether the \ncircumstances relating to the violations occurred “ primarily ” and “ substantially ” in Illinois.  Id .  In \nmaking this inquiry, courts look to “ the residency of the plaintiff, the location of harm, \ncommunications between parties (where sent and where received), and where a company policy is \ncarried out. ”  Rivera v. Google Inc ., 238 F.Supp.3d 1088, 1101 (N.D. Ill. 2017)  (Chang, J.) . \nPlaintiffs allege that the Illinois subclass are Illinois residents, the Clearview defendants failed \nto provide notice to the Illinois subclass members in Illinois, and defendants trespassed on the \nIllinois subclass members’ private domains in Illinois.  Also, plaint iffs maintain that defendants  have  \ncontracted with hundreds of Illinois entities, both public and private.  Construing the allegations in \nplaintiffs’ favor, they have plausibly alleged that the relevant  BIPA violations occurred primarily and \nsubstantially in Illinois  despite Clearview’s contention that the alleged violations took place in New \nYork  because the scraping of facial images and creation of the searchable database took place there.   \nThat said, t he Court , recognizes  that the applicati on of the extraterritoriality doctrine is a fact  intense \ninquiry that is best left for summary judgment  once the parties have co mpleted  discovery.   See Rivera , \n238 F.Supp.3d at 1102; Vance v. IBM, Case No. 20 C 0577, 2020 WL 5530134, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 6 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n 2020)  (Kocoras, J.) .  The Court denies defendants’ motion to dismiss based on the extraterritoriality \ndoctrine.  \nDormant Commerce Clause  \nThe Clearview defendants also argue that BIPA, as sought to be appl ied here, violates the \nDormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  “ While the Commerce Clause,  U.S. \nCONST.  art. I § 8, cl. 3, explicitly grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce among the \nStates, it has long been understood that it also directly limits t he power of the States to discriminate \nagainst or burden interstate commerce.”  Alliant Energy Corp. v. Bie , 330 F.3d 904, 911 (7th Cir. 2003) .  \nThe restraint on the power of states to regulate commerce is referred to as the Do rmant C ommerce \nClause.  Regan v. City of Hammond, Ind ., 934 F.3d 700, 702 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Dormant Commerce \nClause prohibits “ the application of a state statute to co mmerce that takes places  wholly  outside  of \nthe State’s borders, whether or not the commerce has effects within the State.”   Healy  v. Beer Inst., \nInc., 491 U.S. 324, 336, 109 S.Ct. 2491, 105 L.Ed.2d 275 (1989) . \nAs discuss ed, plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the BIPA violations occurred primarily \nand substantially in Illinois, therefore,  the violations did not take place “wholly outside” of Illinois.  \nMeanwhile, i n support of their argument,  the Clearview defendants rel y on facts that are not alleged \nin the first amended consolidated class action complaint, including that Illinois residences make up \nonly a small percentage of  its database —facts the Court cannot consider at this juncture .  See Smith v. \nBurge, 222 F.Supp.3d 669, 691 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (St. Eve, J.) ( “defendant cannot, in presenting its \n12(b)(6) challenge, attempt to refute the complaint or to present a different set of allegations”) \n(citation omitted).   As with the Clearview defendants’ related extrat erritoriality arguments, whether \nBIPA controls commercial conduct that occur s wholly outside Illinois is a question best left for later \nin these proceedings after the parties have completed discovery.  See Rivera , 238 F.3d at 1104; Vance, Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 7 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n 2020 WL 5530134, at *3.  The Court denies defendants’ motion to dismiss  based on the Dormant \nCommerce Clause.  \nBIPA and Photographs  \nThe Clearview defendants additionally argue that under the plain language of the statute, \nBIPA expressly excludes photographs and inf ormation derived from photographs from its reach.  \nTo explain, BIPA defines biometric identifier as follows:  \n“Biometric identifier” means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of \nhand or face geometry.  Biometric identifiers do not include writing samples, written \nsignatures, photographs, human biological samples used for valid scientific testing or \nscreening, demographic data, tattoo descriptions, or physical descriptions such as \nheight, weight, hair color, or eye color[.]  \n \n740 ILCS 14/10.  \n \nIn support of their argument, the Clearview defendants do not mention the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois cases that have addressed this exact argument, nor do they mention this argument \nin their reply brief.  This is probably because Illinois courts  have uniformly rejected the argument \nthat BIPA exempts biometric data extracted from photographs.  As Judge Chang explained in Rivera , \na “‘biometric identifier ’ is not the underlying medium itself, or a way of taking measurements, but \ninstead is a set of measurements of a specified physical component (eye, finger, voice, hand, face) \nused to identify a person.”   Rivera , 238 F.Supp.3d at 1096; see also  Flores  v. Motorola Solutions, Inc. , No. \n21-cv-1128, 2021 WL 232627, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 8, 2021) (Norgle, J.)  (“The Court cannot say that \nthose protections do not apply to any publicly published photographs of individuals —especially \ngiven that the biometric data in this case is the facial geometry of the class members, in contrast to \nthe photos themse lves.”).  The Court finds these opinions persuasive and denies defendants’ motion \nto dismiss on this basis.   \nIndividual Defendants’ Liab ility \nNext, d efendants assert  that the individual defendants, Ton- That, and Schwartz , should be Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 8 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n dismissed from this lawsuit because they cannot be held liable for actions they took as Clearview’s \nofficers or employees.  In response, plaintiffs argue that the individual defendants can be liable for \nClearview’s conduct because they personally participated in the alleged tortious conduct , and, in the \nalternative,  are alter egos of Clearview.  D efendants note  that the law of the state of incorporation, \nDelaware, applies  to plaintiffs’ arguments .  On Command Video Corp. v. Roti , 705 F.3d 267, 272 ( 7th \nCir. 2013)  (“veil-piercing claims are governed by the law of the state of the corporation whose veil is \nsought to be pierced”).   Plaintiffs maintain that Illinois and Delaware law yield the same result.  \nExamining the personal participation doctrine, “[ a]s the human through which the corporate \nprincipal acts, ‘ [a] corporate  officer can be held personally liable for the torts he commits and cannot \nshield himself behind a corporation when he is a participant. ’”  Prairie Capital III, L.P. v. Double E \nHolding Corp ., 132 A.3d 35, 60 (Del. Ch. 2015)  (citation omitted) ; see also Brasby v. Morris, Case No. \n05C-10-022-RFS, 2007 WL 949485, at *8 (Del. Super.  Mar. 9, 2007) (“The personal participation \ndoctrine s tands for the idea that, in certain situations, an officer in a corporation can be held liable \nfor his own wrongful acts .”).  Likewise, under Illinois law, “[c] orporate officers are generally not \nliable for corporate obligations,” however, they “are liable for any tort of the corporation in which \nthey participate.”   IOS Capital, Inc. v. Phoenix Printing, Inc., 808 N.E.2d 606, 611, 283 Ill.Dec. 640, 348 \nIll.App.3d 366 (4 th Dist.  2004) .  \nPlaintiffs allege that Ton- That, the co -founder and Chief Executive Officer of Clearview , \nand Schwartz, the co -founder and Clearview’s President, participated in, consented to, approved, \nauthorized,  and directed the wrongful acts alleged  in the complaint.1  Further, p laintiffs  state  that \nTon- That and Schwartz authorized and directed the scheme to collect and distribute biometrics, \nexecuted agreements on Clearview’s behalf, and treated the biometric database as their own.  \n \n1 Plaintiffs do not argue that Clearview’s General Counsel, Thomas Mulcaire, personally participated in the \nprivacy tort s by directing, ordering, ratifying, approving, or consenting to the tortious acts .  Therefore, he is \nnot individually liable for Clearview’s actions.  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 9 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n Plaintiffs’ allegations —viewed in their favor —plausibly sugges t that Ton -That and Schwartz acted \noutside  of their corporate capacit ies because these corporate officers personal ly participated in the \nprivacy tort  by direct ing, order ing, ratif ying, approv ing, or consent ing to the tortious act.   See Brandt \nv. Rokeby Realty Co. , Case No. C.A. 97C -10-132-RFS, 2004 WL 2050519, at *10 (Del. Super. Sept. 8, \n2004) .  Because plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Ton -That and Schwartz acted outside of their \ncorporate capacities when they personal ly violated BIPA and plaintiffs’ other privacy claims,  the \nCourt denies defendants’ motion to dismiss individual defendants Ton- That and Schwartz .  These \nallegations also defeat defendants’ fiduciary shield arguments , see Mutnick v. Clearview AI, Inc., Nos. 20 \nC 0512, 20 C 0846, 2020 WL 4676667, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 12, 2020) (Coleman, J.) , arguments that \ndefendants developed for the first time in their reply brief.   See White , 8 F.4th at 552 (“ arguments \nraised for the first time in [a] reply  brief are waived”).  \nAs to the  parties’ alter ego/veil piercing arguments, “Delaware courts consider a number of \nfactors in determining whether to disregard the corporate form and pierce the corporate veil, \nincluding: ‘(1) whether the company was adequately capitalized for the undertaking; (2) whether the \ncompany was solvent; (3) whether corporate formalities were observed; (4) whether the dominant \nshareholder siphoned company funds; and (5) whether, in general, the company simply functioned \nas a façade  for the dominant shareholder.’”   Manichaean Capital, LLC v. Exela Tech., Inc., 251 A.3d \n694, 706 (Del. Ch. 2021) (citation omitted) ; see also Steiner Elec. Co. v. Maniscalco , 51 N.E.3d 45, 57, 401 \nIll.Dec. 852, 864, 2016 IL App (1st) 132023, ¶ 47 (1st Dist. 2016).  In addition, both Illinois and \nDelaware law  “require [] that the corporate structure cause fraud or similar  injustice .”  Wallace ex rel. \nCencom Cable Income Partners II, Inc., L.P. v. Wood , 752 A.2d 1175, 1184 (Del. Ch.  1999) ; Gajda v. Steel \nSolutions Firm, Inc., 39 N.E.3d 263, 272, 395 Ill.Dec. 796, 805, 2015 IL App (1st) 142219, ¶ 23 ( 1st \nDist.  2015) .   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 10 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n Although there are some allegations  in plaintiffs’ first amended complaint  that corporate \nformalities were not always observed at Clearview , such as Clearvie w direct ing its customers to send \npayments to Schwartz’s personal residence and that Schwartz paid for the servers and other costs \nnecessary to carry out Clearview’s scraping and biometric scanning operations , plaintiffs have  not \nadequately alleg ed any other veil pie rcing  factors.  For instance, viewing the allegations in their favor, \nplaintiffs have not provided sufficient  factual detail that Clearview simply functioned as Ton- That’s \nand Schwartz ’s façade .  Furthermore, plaintiffs’ complaint lacks detail ed allegations  supporting their \nargument that Ton- That and Schwartz undercapitalized Clearview.  In the end, plaintiffs’ allegations \nsupporting their alter ego theory of individual liability as to Ton- That and Schwartz do not \nwithstand defendants’  motion to dismiss , especially  because piercing the corporate veil is disfavored \nunder both Delaware and Illinois law.  Judson  Atkinson  Candies,  Inc. v. Latini –Hohberger  Dhimantec,  529 \nF.3d 371, 379 (7th Cir. 2008) ; see also Wallace ex rel. Cencom Cable Income Partners II, Inc., L.P. v. Wood , \n752 A.2d 1175, 1183 (Del.  Ch. 1999) ( “Persuading a Delaware court to disregard the corporate entity \nis a difficult task.”) (citation omitted).   The Court grants defendants’ motion in relation to these alter \nego allegations.  \nDefendant Rocky Mountain2 \nPlaintiffs seek to pierce Rocky Mountain Data Analytics’ LLC corporate veil to hold the \nparent company, Clearview, liable for Rocky Mountain’s actions.  By way of background, Thomas \nMulcaire was Clearview’s General Counsel and Vice President of defendant Rocky Mounta in during \nthe relevant time period, and Rocky Mountain was a special purpose entity used for the sole purpose \n \n2  In a cursory footnote  in their opening brief , defendants argue Thomas Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain \nshould also be dismissed because the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them.   Defe ndants have waived \nthis argument.  See  White v. United States , 8 F.4th 547, 552 (7th Cir. 2021) (“ perfunctory and undeveloped \narguments, as well as arguments that are unsupported by pertinent authority, are waived.”).   Moreover, \ndefendants’ February 2, 2022 notice of supplemental authority adds little, if anything, to their waived \nargument.  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 11 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n of contracting with the Illinois Secretary of State .  Rocky Mountain provided the Illinois Secretary of \nState access to the Clearview database and  biometrics contained therein.   \nIn Delaware, parent “liability may be permissible under either of two distinct theories: (1) the \nalter ego theory, or (2) the agency theory. ”  British Telecomm . v. IAC/InteractiveCorp , 356 F.Supp.3d \n405, 409 (D. Del.  2019).  Under the agency theory, “ a parent corporation is held liable for the \nactions of its subsidiary if the parent directed or authorized those actions.”  Id . (citation omitted) ; see \nalso Chrysler Corp. (Delaware) v. Chaplake Holdings, Ltd. , 822 A.2d 1024, 1035 (Del. 2003) .  “Stated \nanother way, when a subsidiary acts as the agent of the parent corporation, the parent corporation \nmay be liable for actions conducted by the agent.”   British Telecomm. , 356 F.Supp.3d at 409.  For “a \nparent corporation to be liable under the agency test, there must be a ‘close connection between the \nrelationship of the corporations and the cause of action, ’ focusing on ‘ the arrangement between the \nparent and the subsidiary, the authority given in that arrangement, and the relevance of that \narrangement to the plaintiff ’s claim.’ ”  Garza v. Citigroup Inc., 192 F.Supp.3d 508, 514 (D. Del. 2016)  \n(citation omitted).  \n Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Rocky Mountain acted as an agent of Clearview.  \nSpeci fically, they assert Ton -That and Schwartz were directly involved in the creation of Rocky \nMountain and were responsible for allowing Rocky Mountain to sell access to the Clearview \ndatabase to its sole customer, the Illinois Secretary of State.  Plaintiffs  further allege  that Ton- That, \nSchwartz , and Mulcaire authorized and directed a  Clearview salesperson to double as a Rocky \nMountain salesperson, knowing that the salesperson would be paid by Clearview.   Plaintiffs also  \nstate that Ton- That and Schwartz authorized Mulcaire to provide his personal  information to the \nIllinois Secretary o f State, resulting in the Illinois  Secretary of State submitting a voucher to the \nIllinois Comptroller authorizing payment to Mulcaire.   Other allegations include that Rocky \nMountain’s activities, which included collecting, obtaining, distributing, dissemi nating, selling,  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 12 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n leasing , and profiting from the biometrics , were at the direction of Ton- That and Schwartz.   Not \nonly did Ton- That and Schwartz fail to adequately  capitalize Rocky Mountain , they  admit that Rocky \nMountain had no actual operations .  Last, d efendants have waived their argument made for the first \ntime in their reply brief that Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain are exempt based on 740 ILCS 14/25(e).  \nSee White , 8 F.4th at 552.  The Court therefore denies this aspect of defendants’ motion.  \nBIPA Section 15(c) C laim \nDefendants nex t contend that plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently a llege a c laim under 740 \nILCS 14/15(c), which prohibits private entities from selling, leasing, trading, or  otherwise  profit ing \nfrom a person’s biometric identifiers or information.   Defendants specifically argue that none of \nplaintiffs’ factual allegations describe s Clearview’s customers receiving access to the Clearview \ndatabase  or that the customers receive d access to plaintiffs’ biometric information.  Despite this \nargument, the fir st amended consolidated class action complaint repeatedly states (1) defendants \ndeveloped their technology for their own profit; (2) defendants sold, distributed, disseminated, traded , leased, and otherwise profited from the biometric database; (3) defenda nts sold access to the \ndatabase to more than 200 private companies who searched the biometric database for their \nbusiness purposes; and (4) defendants profited from selling access to the database.  Plaintiffs’ \nallegations state a plausible BIPA 15(c) claim .  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679 (“Determining whether a \ncomplaint states a plausible  claim for relief” is “a context -specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and  common  sense .”).  \nNevertheless, defendants maintain that the statute’s language “otherwise profit from” \nindicates that BIPA 15(c) prohibits only the sale of biometric data, not the business of using biometric technology.  At its core, plaintiffs’ claim  concerns  the sale of biometric data because the \nClearview defendants’ business model is premised on collecting and capturing biometric data and then profiting from that data when customers pay to search the Clearview database.  Thus, when a Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 13 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n customer pays to search the database  containing plaintiffs’ biometric information to find a potential \nmatch, defendants profit from plaintiffs’ biometric data in violation of BIPA 15(c).  See Flores , 2021 \nWL 232627, at *3.  Therefore, defendants’ argument is without merit . \nStanding for State Law Claims  \nThe Clearview d efendants additionally argue that plaintiffs do not have Article III standing \nto bring their claims under California, Virginia, and New York state law.  “ Article  III of the \nConstitution limits the federal judicial power to deciding ‘ Cases ’ and ‘ Controversies’” and “as an \nessential part of a federal court ’s authority under Article III, [the] standing doctrine ensures respect \nfor these jurisdictional bounds.”   Prairie Rivers  Network,  2 F.4th at 1007.  To establish standing under \nArticle III, a plaintiff must show: (1) he suffered an injury -in-fact; (2) that is fairly traceable to the \ndefendants ’ conduct; and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.   Cothron v. \nWhite Castle System, Inc.,  20 F.4th 1156, 1160 ( 7th Cir. 2021) .  Under the first requirement, an injury -\nin-fact must be “concrete and particularized” and “actual  or imminent.”   Prosser  v. Becerra , 2 F.4th \n708, 713 (7th Cir. 2021).  Defendants focus on the injury -in-fact requirement argu ing that plaintiffs \nhave not suffered any  cognizable injuries, such as identity theft.  \nTo determine whether the disclosure of plaintiffs’ private information caused a  sufficiently \nconcrete harm to support standing , courts look to both history and the judgment of Congress  for \nguidance.  Gadelhak  v. AT&T Servs.,  Inc., 950 F.3d 458, 462 (7th Cir. 2020) (Barrett, J.) .  The \nhistorical inquiry asks, “whether the asserted harm has a ‘close relationship’ to a harm traditionally \nrecognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts —such as physical harm, monetary \nharm, or various intangible harms.”  TransUnion , LLC v. Ramirez , 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2200 (2021) .  As \nthe TransUnion  Court clarified, “[v]arious intangible harms can also be concrete” including \n“reputational harms, disclosure of private information, and intrusion upon seclusion.” Id.  at 2204.   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 14 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that defendants’ disclosure of their private in formation \nwithout their consent caused them the concrete harm of violating their privacy interests in their \nbiometric data.   In addition, the nonconsensual taking of plainti ffs’ private information is a concrete \nharm because the possibility of misuse is ever present.  Because plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a concrete harm supporting Article III standing, the Court denies defendants’ motion in this respect.  \nVirginia State Law Claims  \n In Counts Eight and Nine of the first amended consolidated class action complaint, plaintif f \nShelby Zelonis Roberson, on behalf of herself a nd others similarly situated in the Virginia Subclass, \nbring s two claim s under Virginia law, including , the Virginia statu te prohibiting the unauthorized use \nof names or pictures, Virginia Code § 8.01- 40(A) , as alleged in Count Eight.  V irginia Code §  8.01-\n40(A) states:  \nAny person whose name, portrait, or picture is used without having first obtained \nthe written consent of such person, or if dead, of the surviving consort and if none, \nof the next of kin, or if a minor, the written consent of his or her parent or guardian, \nfor adver tising purposes or for the purposes of trade , such persons may maintain \na suit in equity  against the person, firm, or corporation so using such person’ s name.  \n \n(emphasis added).   \nIn their motion, defendants argue plaintiffs have failed to allege that defe ndants used their \nlikenesses for advertising purpose s, but the statute unequivocally states  that plaintiffs may also \nestablish a claim under §  8.01- 40(A)  if defendants used their likenesses  for the purposes of trade.  \nTown & Country Prop . Inc. v. Riggins , 457 S.E.2d 356, 362, 249 Va. 387, 394 (Va. 1995)  (“Use for \n‘advertising purposes’ and use ‘for the purposes of trade’ are separate and distinct statutory \nconcepts. ”).  “In determining whether the use was ‘ for the purposes of trade, ’ courts are to consider \nwhether the [picture] was used to draw trade to an entity. ”  Goodweather v. Parekh , No. 20- cv-0006, \n2020 WL 9259760, at *10 (E.D. Va.  Sept. 18, 2020) .  Here, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 15 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n the Clearview defendants profited from the unconsented use of their likenesses  under “for purposes \nof trade .”   \nNonetheless, the Clearview defendants maintain plaintiffs’ publicity  right claim fails because \nthe use of plaintiffs’ photographs  or likeness  has a protected public interest purpose.  See  Wiest v. E -\nFense, Inc., 356 F.Supp.2d 604, 611 (E.D. Va.  2005)  (“If a name or likeness is used without consent in \nconnection with matters that are ‘ newsworthy ’ or of ‘ public interest, ’ the statute does not apply .”).  \nIn particular, defendants argue that the right to publicity must yield to constitutional free  speech \ninterests.   Keeping in mind that a motion to dismiss concerns the sufficiency of the allegations , the \nCourt rejects defendants’ argument because, as plaintiffs have allege d, the Clearview defendants \nscraped  plaintiffs’ photographs to build a database from which defendants  profit ed and that this \nconduct did not have any connection to public affairs .  Defendants’ cursory arguments about \n“speech interests” does not change this analysis.  T he Court  denies defendants’ motion to dismiss  \nCount Eight.  \n In Count Nine, Roberson alleges the Clearview defendants violated Virginia’s Computer \nCrimes Act  (“VCCA”) , Virginia Code §  18.2-152.1, et seq.  See Hately v. Watts , 917 F.3d 770, 781 ( 4th \nCir. 2019)  (“The Virginia Computer Crimes Act is a criminal statute with a private civil right of \naction .”).  To establish a VCCA claim, plaintiffs must eventually prove the Clearview defendant s: (1) \nused a computer or computer network; (2) without authority; and (3) either obtained  property or \nservices by false pretenses , embezzl ement  or larceny, or convert ed the property of another.   See \nRosciszewski v. Arete Assoc. , Inc., 1 F.3d 225, 230 ( 4th Cir. 1993) ; Cvent, Inc. v. Eventbrite, Inc., 739 \nF.Supp.2d 927, 934 (E.D. Va. 2010) .   \n Defendants first argue that plaintiffs have failed to allege an actual injury, but “[i]n Virginia, \none holds a property interest in one’s name and likeness .” Riggins , 457 S.E.2d at 364.  Here, plaintiffs \nhave stated  an actual injury based on their allegations that defendant s conver ted their likenesses.  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 16 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>17 \n Defendants also contend plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege that Clearview used any \ncomputer or computer network without authority .  Defendants’ argument is without merit because \nplaintiffs allege that defendants scrap ed their  images  in violation of the terms of service of the \nwebsites on which the ir images were hosted and without the  plaintiffs’ consent and that defendants \nconverted their property interest in their likenesses.  In addition, defendants assert that plaintiffs \nfailed “to allege false pretenses, conversion, artifice, tricker, or deception,” although, as discussed, \nplainti ffs clearly allege that defendants converted the ir property interest s.  The Court denies \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss  Count Nine.  \nCalifornia State Law Claim s \n In Counts Ten through Thirteen, plaintiff Andrea Vestrand, on behalf of herself and others \nsimilarly situated in the California Subclass, brings claims under California statutory and common \nlaw.  In Count Ten, Vestrand alleges the Clearview defendants violated California’s Unfair \nCompetition Law (“UCL”)  by using her biometric information without her consent .  To bring a \nclaim under the UCL, a plaintiff  must “(1) establish a loss or deprivation of money or property \nsufficient to quantify as injury in fact, i.e., economic  injury , and (2) show that the economic injury was \nthe result of, i.e.,  caused  by, the unfair business practice.”  Kwikset  Corp.  v. Superior  Court , 51 Cal . 4th \n310, 322, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877 ( Cal. 2011) (emphasis in original) .  \nPlaintiffs’ UCL claim necessarily fails because personal information is not “property” for \npurposes of the UCL .  See In re Facebook Privacy Litig. , 791 F.Supp.2d 705, 714 (N.D. Cal. 2011) .  \nIndeed, “[n]umerous courts have held that disclosure of personal information alone  does not \nconstitute economic or  property  loss sufficient to establish UCL  standing, unless the plaintiff \nprovides specific allegations regarding the value of the information.”  Mastel v. Miniclip SA , ___ \nF.Supp.3d  ___, 2021 WL 2983198, at *11 (E.D. Cal. 2021) .   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 17 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>19 \n The Clearview defendants argue that Vestrand’s common law right to publicity claim fail s \nbecause she does not have an economic interest in her likeness.  Vestrand, however, is not required \nto plead facts corresponding to each legal element of her claim to survive a motion to dismiss, but \ninstead, need only allege a plausible claim.  Chapman  v. Yellow  Cab Cooperative , 875 F.3d  846, 848 (7th  \nCir. 2017) .  Vestrand has done so by alleging that  the Clearview defendants used her photographs \nand likeness without authorization for  commercial gain .  Further, Vestrand alleges the California \nSubclass was injured because the Clearview defendants  did not compensate them for the  use of their \nlikenesses, identifies, and photographs.  These allegations plausibly state a common law right to \npublicity claim under California law.  \nNext, under California’s statutory remedy, § 3344,  plaintiffs must also show “a knowing use \nby the defendant as well as a direct connection between the alleged use and the commercial \npurpose.”  Downing , 265 F.3d at 1001.  Defendants argue that §  3344 requires plaintiffs to allege that \nits use of the Clear view database was for purposes of advertising, selling, or soliciting.  By making \nthis argument, defendants ignore  parts of §  3344(a), which states, “ [a]ny person who knowingly uses \nanother ’s name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness in any manne r, on or in products, \nmerchandise, or goods, or for purposes of advertising or selling, or  soliciting purchases of, products, \nmerchandise, goods or services, without such person’ s prior consent  … shall be liable for any \ndamages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof. ” (emphasis added).  Thus , \nunder §  3344, plaintiffs need not allege that  defendants used their photos or likenesses for purposes \nof advertising, selling, or so liciting  as defendants argue   As discussed, plaintiffs have adequately \nalleged the Clearview defendants  knowingly used their photos by accessing the Clearview database \nfor a profit .  The Court denies  defendants’  motion to dismiss Counts Eleven and Twelve.  \nIn Count Thirteen, Vestrand al leges defendants  violated her right to privacy under the \nCalifornia Constitution.  To establish a claim for invasion of privacy under the California Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 19 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>20 \n Constitution,  a plaintiff must e ventually show (1) she  possess es a legally protected privacy interest , \n(2) she maintain s a reasonable expectation of privacy , and (3) defendant’s conduct constituted a \nserious invasion of privacy.  Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 865 P.2d 633, 654- 55, 26 \nCal.Rptr.2d 834, 7 Cal.4th 1 ( Cal. 1994) .   \nDefendants argue Vestrand  failed to plausibly  allege that she possess es a legally protected \nprivacy interest.  The California Constitution protects two separate classes of privacy interests:  (1) \ninformation privacy, which includes interests in precluding the dissemination or misuse of confidential and sensitive information; and (2) autonomy privacy, including interests in making \npersonal decisions or conducting personal activities without intrusion.  In re Google Location History Litig., 514 F.Supp.3d 1147, 1154 (N.D. Cal. 2021) .  Because autonomy privacy protects bodily \nautonomy, it does not apply under the circumstances.  Se e In re Yahoo Mail Litig ., 7 F.Supp.3d 1016, \n1039 (N.D. Cal. 2014) .  The Court therefore examines whether plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the \nfirst class of privacy interests, information privacy.  \nVestrand has sufficiently alleged that the Clearview defendants’ conduct constituted a serious \ninvasion of he r information privacy  because b iometric information, by its very nature, is sensitive \nand confidential.  In addition, plaintiffs allege that the California Subclass had a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy to their highly sensitive biometrics  despite defendants’ argument that they \nhad no reasonable expectation of privacy over photographs  they uploaded to public websites .  \nAgain, the Clearview  defendants ignore that their conduct invades plaintiffs’ privacy in their \nbiometric information, n ot plaintiffs’ mere photographs.   Vestrand has therefore plausibly alleged \nher right to privacy claim under the California Constitution.   New York State Law Claim  \nIn Count Fourteen, plaintiff Aaron Hurvitz, on behalf of himself and others similarly \nsituated in the New York Subclass, brings  a claim under New York’s Civil Rights Act § 51.  The Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 20 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>21 \n purpose of § 51 is to protect individuals from the commerci al exploitation of their name or image.  \nSee Kuklachev v. Gelfman , 600 F.Supp.2d 437, 474- 75 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) .  To establish liability under  § \n51, a plaintiff must show defendant’s nonconsensual use of his name, portrait, picture, or voice \nwithin the state of New York for purposes of advertising or trade.  See Electra v. 59 Murray Enter ., \nInc., 987 F.3d 233, 249 ( 2d Cir. 2021) .    \nThe Clearview defendants argue  Hurvitz has  not sufficiently alleged that his picture was used \nfor trade purposes.  New York “courts have defined use ‘for the purposes of trade’ as use which \n‘would draw trade to the firm’ or ‘use for the purpose of making profit.’”  Amusement Indus ., Inc. v. \nStern, 693 F.Supp.2d 301, 314 (S.D.N.Y. 2 010) (citation omitted ).  Plaintiffs have repeatedly alleged \nthe Clearview defendants developed technology to invade the privacy of the American public for \ntheir own profit.  Accordingly, the Court denies defendants’ motion to dismiss Count Fourteen.  \nUnjust Enrichment Clai m \nNext, t he Clearview def endants move to dismiss plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim alleged \nin Count Fifteen of the first amended consolidated class action complaint.  In particular,  defendants \nargue that unjust enrichment is not a viable, stand- alone claim under Illinois, Virgin ia, California, or \nNew York law.  Under Illinois law, unjust enrichment “ is not a separate cause of action that, \nstanding alone, would justify an action for recovery.”  Toushin v. Ruggiero , 2021 IL App (1st) 192171, \n¶ 80, 2021 WL 2718495, at *13 ( 1st Dist.  2021) (quoting  Mulligan v. QVC, Inc., 888 N.E.2d 1190, \n1200, 321 Ill.Dec. 257, 267, 382 Ill.App.3d 620, 631 ( 1st Dist.  2008) .  Rather, unjust enrichment is a \ncondition resulting from unlawful or improper conduct like fraud and may be redressed by a ca use \nof action based upon that improper conduct.  Toushin , 2021 IL App (1st) 192171, ¶ 80.   “[I]f an \nunjust enrichment claim rests on the same improper conduct alleged in another claim, then the \nunjust enrichment claim will be tied to this related claim —and, of course, unjust enrichment will \nstand or  fall with the related claim .”  Cleary v. Philip Morris Inc ., 656 F.3d 511, 517 ( 7th Cir. 2011) .  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 21 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>22 \n Because plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged their BIPA claims, the Court denies defendants’  motion \nto dismiss the unjust enrichment claim attendant to the BIPA claims.  \nUnder Virginia law, a claim of unjust enrichment requires  a showing that the defendant \nreceived benefits of which the defendant was aware and that the defendant accepted or retained the \nbenefit without paying for its value.  Fessler v. IBM Corp.,  959 F.3d 146, 157 ( 4th Cir. 2020).  Because \nplaintiffs have adequately that the Clearview defendants used the benefit of their biometric data \nwithout paying them for its value, the Court denies the Clearview defendants’ motion to dismiss the Virginia unjust enrichment claim.  \nThe Ninth Circuit has explained that a California common law  unjust enrichment claim may \nsurvive either “as an independent cause of action or as a quasi -contract claim for restitution.”   ESG \nCapital Partners, LP v. Stratos , 828 F.3d 1023, 1038 ( 9th Cir. 2016) ; see also Hart v. TWC Product & Tech. \nLLC , 526 F.Supp.3d 592, 604 (N.D. Cal. 2021) .  “To allege unjust enrichment as an independent \ncause of action, a plaintiff must show that the defendant received and unjustly retained a benefit at \nthe plaintiff’s expense.”  ESG Capital Partners, 828 F.3d at 1028.  P laintiffs have sufficiently alleged \ndefendants were unjustly enriched by  the use of their biometric information without their  consent.  \nThe Clearview defendants, however, correctly assert  plaintiffs’ New York common law \nunjust enrichment claim s are preempted by New York Civil Rights Act §§ 50, 51.  See Sondik v \nKimmel, 131 A.D. 3d 1041, 1042, 16 N.Y.S.3d 296, 298 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015)  (“Common -\nlaw unjust  enrichment  claims for the unauthorized use of an image or likeness are preempted \nby Civil Rights  Law  §§ 50 and  51.”); Myskina v. Conde Nast Publications, Inc. , 386 F.Supp.2d 409, 420 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2005) ( same).  The Court grants this  aspect of defendants’  motion to dismiss.   \n  Declaratory Judgment Claim  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 22 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>23 \n \n On a final note, because defendants’ argument for dismissing plaintiffs’ declaratory and \ninjunctive relief claim in Count  Sixteen is solely based on plaintiffs’ failure to state a claim , the Court \ndenies defendants’ motion to dismiss  this count . \n \nConclusion  \nThe Court grants in part and denies in part defendants’ motion to dismiss  [87]. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDate:  2/14/2022     Entered: _____________________________ \n         SHARON JOHNSON COLEMAN \n         United States District Judg e Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 23 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied Peloton Interactive, Inc.'s motion to dismiss a class action lawsuit alleging violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The plaintiffs contend that Peloton’s website chat feature, with embedded software from Drift, intercepted and recorded communications without user consent to enhance Drift's AI technologies. The court found that the plaintiff sufficiently alleged that Drift acted as a third-party eavesdropper for its purposes, thus contravening the privacy law.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Peloton and its third-party software provider, Drift, violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act by intercepting and utilizing user chat data without consent, thereby acting as a third-party eavesdropper.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff presented a plausible claim under Section 631(a) of CIPA, sufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss, by alleging that Drift intercepted communications for its own benefit, thus acting as a third-party eavesdropper.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're texting your friend, and you think it's just the two of you chatting. But secretly, a third person reads your messages and uses them to get better at their job. In this lawsuit, Peloton's website chats were allegedly getting spied on by a third-party software that took your conversations and used them to make its AI better. This is like someone peeking at your chat without telling you, and the court thinks that's not okay under California law.",

[ECF No. 20 .] The Court decides the matter on the papers submitted and \nwithout oral argument.  See Civ. L. R. 7.1(d.1).  For the reasons stated below, the Court  \ndenies the Motion to Dismiss.  \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND1 \nPlaintiff brings this putative class action against Peloton as the owner and operator \nof the website https://www.onepeloton.com  (“Website”)  for violations of the California \nInvasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code § 631(a), Clause Four. (First Amended \n \n1 The facts are taken from the Complaint.

Plaintiff’s claim arise s from Defendant’s use of the third- party \nsoftware called Drift which was embedded into the Website chat feature. Chat \ncommunications with the Website ar e automatically intercepted and record ed by Drift  \nwhich creates transcripts of the conversations. Drift receives the communications while \nthey are  in transit because the imbedded code routes the communications directly to Drift. \nWebsite users are not informed that Drift is intercepting the communications but instead \nconsumers believe they are interacting only with a Peloton representative. Drift allegedly \nharvests data from the chat transcripts it intercepts,  and then interprets, analyzes, stores, \nand uses the data for a variety purposes . Information collected includes the full transcript \nof the conversation, the date and time the conversation began, the IP address of the \nvisitor, the web browser they used to access the Website, the devi ce used and which \nwords triggered the Drift software to rout e the visitor to a particular Peloton \nrepresentative. According to Plaintiff, visitors to the Website often share personal \ninformation on the chat due to the nature of Peloton’s business. Plaintiff and other class \nmembers visited the Website within the class period using smart phones, and/or wifi -\nenabled tablets and laptops.  \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \nOn June 9, 2023 , Plaintiff filed a Complaint asserting  violations of CIPA , the UCL \nand California Constitution in relation to the unauthorized interception,  collection, \nrecording, and dissemination of Plaintiff’s and Class Members’ communications and \ndata. [ECF No. 1.]  On August 16, 2023, Defendant a motion to dismiss which the Court \ngranted on March 12, 2024. [ECF No. 18.] Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint \ncontaining a single CIPA Section 631(a) claim on March 15, 2024. [ECF No. 19.] On \nMarch 29, 2024, Defendant filed the present Motion to Dismiss the First Amended \nComplaint. [ECF No. 20.] On April 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response in Opposition. \n[ECF No. 21.] On April 22, 2024, Defendant filed a Reply. [ECF No. 22.]  \n// \n// Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 2 of 9 \n   3 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 III. DISCUSSION  \nDefendant seeks dismissal of this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \nA. Failure to State a Claim  \nA 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of the  complaint. Navarro v. \nBlock, 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir.  2001). A pleading must contain, in part, “a short and \nplain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to  relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2). But plaintiffs must also plead “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on  its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The plausibility standard demands more than “a formulaic \nrecitation of the  elements of a cause of action,” or “‘naked assertions’ devoid of ‘further \nfactual enhancement.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly , \n550 U.S. at  557). Instead, the complaint “must contain allegations of underlying facts \nsufficient to give fair notice and to enable the  opposing party to defend itself effectively.” \nStarr v. Baca , 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).  \nIn reviewing a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “[a]ll allegations of material fact are \ntaken as true and construed in the light  most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Cahill v. \nLiberty  Mut. Ins. Co. , 80 F.3d 336, 337 –38 (9th Cir. 1996). However,  a court need not \ntake legal conclusions as true merely because they are cast in the form of factual \nallegations. See Roberts v. Corrothers, 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 1987). Similarly,  \n “conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences  are not sufficient to defeat a \nmotion to dismiss.” Pareto v.  FDIC , 139 F.3d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1998).   \n1. Violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal Penal Code § 631 \nSection 631(a) of the California Penal Code imposes civil and criminal liability on \n“any person who by means of any machine, instrument, or contrivance, or in any other \nmanner : \n[1] intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection, whether \nphysically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 3 of 9 \n   4 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable, or instrument, including the wire, \nline, cable, or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, \nor \n[2] who willfully and without the consent of all parties to the \ncommunication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, \nor to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report, or \ncommunication while the same is in transit or passing o ver any wire, line, or \ncable, or is being sent from, or received at any place within this state; or \n[3] who uses, or attempts to use, in any manner, or for any purpose, or to \ncommunicate in any way, any information so obtained, or \n[4] who aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons \nto unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any of the acts or things \nmentioned above in this section[.] \nCal. Penal Code § 631(a)(subsections added and formatted for clarity).  \nThe California Supreme Court has explained that Section 631(a) consists of three \nmain clauses which cover “three distinct and mutually independent patterns of conduct”: \n(1) “intentional wiretapping,” (2) “willfully attempting to learn the contents or meaning \nof a communication in transit over a wire,” and (3) “attempting to use or communicate \ninformation obtai ned as a result of engaging in either of the two previous activities.” \nTavernetti v. Superior Court , 22 Cal. 3d 187, 192 (1978). The fourth basis for liability in \nSection 631(a) imposes liability for aiding and abetting on any person or persons who  \n“unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any of the’ other three bases for liability. ” \nMastel v. Miniclip SA , 549 F.Supp.3d 1129, 1134 (E.D. Cal. 2021) (quoting Cal. Penal \nCode § 631(a)) .  \nIn the FAC , Plaintiff alleges that Peloton “aids and abets Drift to commit both \nunlawful interception [Clause Two] and unlawful use [Clause Three] under Section 631(a), surreptitiously and as a matter of course.” (FAC  ¶ 41). Plaintiff makes no \nallegations regarding Clause One.  \n// \n// Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 4 of 9 \n   5 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 a. Section 631(a) Clause Two-  Unlawful Interception  \nTo establish liability under the s econd clause of section 631(a), Plaintiff must \nallege that Drift  “willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or \nin any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or \nmeaning of any message .” Cal. Penal Code § 631(a). “[C]ourts have applied Section \n631(a) via the language of its second clause to the internet browsing context.” Williams  v. \nWhat If Holdings , 2022 WL 17869275, at *2 (N.D. Cal. 2022).  \nUnder this clause,  a person is liable if he or she secretly listens to another's \nconversation. Ribas v. Clark , 38 Cal. 3d 355, 359 (1985). Only a third party can \n“eavesdrop” on a conversation, therefore a party to the communication is exempt from liability under section 631. See In re Facebook, Inc. Internet Tracking Litig.,  956 F.3d \n589, 607 (9th Cir. 2020); Warden v. Kahn , 99 Cal.App.3d 805, 811 (Ct. App. 1979). \nThere is no definition for the term “party” in CIPA, therefore, courts have looked to the \ntechnical processes an d context of the interception when considering who qualifies as a \nthird -party eavesdropper.  Facebook , 956 F.3d at 607.   \nDefendant argues that the party exemption applies because Plaintiff ’s factual \nallegations  establish that Drift provides a tool that allows Peloton to record and analyze \nits own data in aid of its business which means it functions as an extension of Peloton \nrather than as a third- party eavesdropper. (Mot. at 9).   According to Peloton, Plaintiff’s \nclaim  that Drift is a third -party because it uses the intercepted data to improve its AI \nchatbot is insufficient to show that the data is aggregated, re -distributed or sold to other \nvendors as required to be considered a third- party eavesdropper. ( Id. at 7-8).  In addition, \nPlaintiff did not specifically allege that she interacted with Drift’s AI chat feature when \nshe allegedly visited the Website, but instead it appears her communications were \nintercepted by a traditional “rule -based” chatbot. (Id . at 8 -9).  \nIn response, Plaintiff argues that Drift functions as a third -party eavesdropper \nbecause it uses  the intercepted data for its own purposes including to improve the \ntechnological function and capabilities of its patented AI software assets for the exclusive Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 5 of 9 \n   6 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 purpose of increasing the value of Drift’s shareholders equity in the company.  (Oppo. at \n4).  According to Plaintiff, t hese uses go “beyond simply supplying this information back \nto Defendant,” making Drift a third -party . (Id. at 5).  Plaintiff argues it is immaterial \nwhether Plaintiff alleged she used the AI chatbot because the FAC alleges that Drift uses \nall chat conversations, not just those intercepted from the AI chatbots, to improve its \nSaaS platform . (Id.) \nTo answer the question whether a service provider like Drift is more akin to a party \nor a third -party eavesdropper for purposes of the party exception, courts look to the \n“technical context of the case.” Facebook , 956 F.3d at 607. Two lines of district court \ncases have emerged in California addressing whether the party exemption can apply to \nsoftware providers. See Javier v. Assurance, 649 F.Supp.3d 891, 899- 901 (N.D. Cal. \n2023) (discussing two lines of cases).  \nIn the first line of cases, a software provider can be h eld liable under the second \nprong of section 631(a) if that entity  listens in on a conversation between the participants, \neven if one of the participants consents to the additional party’s presence , and the entity \nuses the collected data for its own commercial purposes . Ribas, 38 Cal. 3d at 361-62. For \ninstance, an independent party that captures data from a hosting website to sell to \nadvertisers to generate revenue has been considered an eavesdropper. Facebook , 956 F.3d \nat 607- 608 (Facebook used embedded software to track  its users to third -party websites \neven when its users were not signed into Facebook, and then sold that data to \nadvertisers) ; see also Revitch v. New Moosejaw , 2019 WL 5485330, * 2 (N.D. Cal. 2019 ) \n(marketing company and data broker NaviStone operated as a third party because they \nused intercepted data to “create marketing databases of identified website visitors ” and \nsold the information. ) \nIn the second line of cases, i f the s oftware provider merely collects, refines, and \nrelays the information obtained on the company website back to the company “in aid of \n[defendant’s] business” then it functions as a tool and not as a third- party.  Graham v. \nNoom , 533 F.Supp.3d 831, 832 -833 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2021 ) (tracking service provider Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 6 of 9 \n   7 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 was a participant in the conversation under § 631(a) because that defendant only stored \nuser’s data and did not use or resell that data).   \nSome district courts have cautioned against considering the use  a technical partner \nmakes of the data, finding that doing so reads  a use requirement into the s econd clause \nand usurps  the use inquiry that is contained in the t hird clause.  Javier , 649 F.Supp.3d at \n900 (“reading a use requirement into the second prong would add requirements that are \nnot present (and swallow the third prong in the process)). ” However, the inquiry focuses \non the technical processes by which the data is gathered  and manipulated, a question \nwhich  is often intertwined with the use of that data. Noom , 533 F.Supp.3d at 832.  \nTherefore , the Court considers the technical  aspect along with the use made by Drift of \nthe surreptitiously gathered information.  \nIn the FAC, Plaintiff describes the technical manner in which Drift accesses \ncustomer’s information and explains:   \nChat communications on the Website are intercepted by Drift while those \ncommunications are in transit, and this is accomplished because the \nimbedded code directs those communications to be routed directly to Drift. \nDrift’s chat service is an Application Programming Interface (API) that is \n“plugged into” the Website. The chat function is run from Drift’s servers but \nallows for chat functionality on the Website. In other words, Drift runs the \nchat service from its own servers, but consumers interact with the chat \nservice on Defendant’s Website, so it appears they are only communicating \nwith a company representative of Defendant.  \n(FAC ¶ 13).  \nAfter accessing customers’ communications in this manner,  \n. . . Drift analyzes and uses the chat conversations it intercepts and records to, inter alia , improve its SaaS platform, including proprietary machine \nlearning for its chatbots and related technologies, all of which independently benefits and serves the profit- driven equity interests of Drift’s shareholders . \nIn other words, Drift uses the content of the conversations that Plaintiff and  \nClass  Members  have  with Defendant —without Plaintiff’s or Class \nMembers’ consent —to improve the technological function and capabilities \nof its proprietary, patented artificial  intelligence software assets for the Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 7 of 9 \n   8 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 exclusive purpose and benefit of increasing the value of Drift shareholders’ \nequity in the company and its technologies.  \n(FAC. ¶ 17)(emphasis in original).  \nThe FAC alleges , “Drift’s exploitation, modernization, use of, and interaction with \nthe data it gathers through the chat feature in real time makes it more than a mere \n‘extension’ of Defendant .” (FAC ¶ 19).   \nTaking t hese allegations as true for purposes of the present motion, the Court finds \nPlaintiff has sufficiently allege d that Drift’s software surreptitiously intercepts the data \nentered by Peloton’s customers through the embedded API and uses “the data for their \nown benefit and not for the sole benefit of the party to the communication [Peloton], ” \ntherefore Drift functions as a third- party eavesdropper within the meaning of section \n631(a). Javier , 649 F.Supp.3d at 899; Esparza v. UAG Escondido AI Inc ., 2024 WL \n559241, at *7 (S.D. Cal. 2024) (allegations that a chat service provider “profit[s] from \nsecretly exploiting ” the ability to identify individuals who visited Defendant's website  led \nto a plausible inference that the chat service provider is using the information for its own \npurposes .) For these reasons, the Court finds that the party exemption does not apply and \nPlaintiff has sufficiently stated a claim under c lause two of § 631(a). Accordingly, \nDefendant’s motion to dismiss  is denied  on this ground.   \n(b) Section 631(a) Clause Three “Use” Claim  and C lause Fo ur “Aiding and \nAbetting ” \nMaintaining  a claim under the t hird clause of § 631 requires “ attempting to use or \ncommunicate information obtained as a result of engaging in either of the two previous \nactivities ” i.e. intentional wiretapping (c lause one) or willfully attempting to learn the \ncontents of a communication in transit over a wire ( clause two). Tavernetti, 22 Cal. 3d at \n192.  As noted above, Plaintiff  has sufficiently alleged a claim under c lause two because \nshe asserts that Drift uses intercepted communications to improve its SaaS platform, \nincluding its proprietary machine lea rning software, which yields a monetary benefit to Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 8 of 9 \n   9 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Drift .  In response, Defendant argues only that Plaintiff fails to state claim for c lause one \nor two, therefore her claim under c lause three also fails.  \nPlaintiff has stated a claim under c lause three of Section 631 because she has \nmaintained a claim under clause two . Cahill, 80 F.3d at 337– 38 (9th Cir. 1996).  For the \nsame reasons, Plaintiff asserts a plausible claim for relief under c lause four for aiding and \nabetting . Cal Penal Code § 631(a). In light of the above, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is \ndenied as to these claims.  \nA. Injunctive Relief  \nPlaintiff has chosen to withdraw her claim for injunctive relief (Oppo. at 13), \ntherefore, the Court dismisses the injunctive relief claim with prejudice.  Hipschman v. \nCnty.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\nThis case involved a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation, which was accused of overstating its financial condition in its IPO registration and other financial statements. The class-action suit consolidated several lawsuits after Quintus filed for bankruptcy and its stock drastically fell in value. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement, finding it fair given the complexities and risks of further litigation. Though Quintus originally dealt with artificial intelligence software, the case does not involve claims directly related to AI.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\nThe key legal issue was whether the proposed settlement agreement, following securities fraud allegations against Quintus for false financial statements, was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class members.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\nThe court held that the settlement was fair and approved the class settlement and the plan of allocation. It also approved the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses, concluding that the proposed settlement amount was appropriate given the circumstances.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine a company that once made AI software, and later, it said it was more successful than it actually was. This caught the attention of people who bought the company's stock, expecting to make money. When the truth came out and the company went bankrupt, the stock price crashed, and the buyers lost a lot of money. Those buyers got together and sued the company. In the court's decision, it was like a teacher stepping in to say the company had to pay the students back some of what they lost. The teacher (judge) decided how to split the money and also covered the costs for the lawyers who helped get the money back.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.

Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985.

Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.

The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04263-VRW   Document 281   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion pertains to a consolidated securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation. The lawsuit, which claimed securities fraud due to misleading financial statements during a specific period, concluded with a settlement amount of $10.1 million to be distributed among affected shareholders. The court approved the settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate, considering the challenges of further litigation and Quintus's bankruptcy status. The case involved Quintus's use of \"e-Customer Relationship Management\" (eCRM) solutions powered by artificial intelligence.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement agreement for the securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation should be approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the proposed settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. It granted final approval of the settlement agreement, the plan of allocation, and the application for attorney fees, expenses, and reimbursement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company called Quintus that used smart technology to manage customer relationships. They sold pieces of their company (stocks) saying they were doing really well. But later on, people found out they weren't telling the truth about how much money they were making. Those who bought stocks got upset and went to court. The court decided that instead of a long fight, everyone agreed the company should pay $10.1 million to the stock buyers who lost money because of these false promises. The judge made sure this was a fair deal for everyone involved.",

The parties have reached a settlement and now seek finalapproval of the proposed settlement and the proposed plan ofallocation.  Doc #274.

For the reasons discussed below, finalapproval of the class settlement and plan of allocation is GRANTEDand the application for award of attorney fees and reimbursement ofexpenses is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04294-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 1 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2I\nWhen Quintus was incorporated in 1984, its business was\nartificial intelligence software.  During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04294-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04294-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04294-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985.

MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04294-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.

The court approved a $10.1 million settlement to be distributed among class members due to the overstated revenues and the subsequent financial downfall of Quintus, leading to bankruptcy. Despite the involvement of artificial intelligence in Quintus's business operations, the case revolves around securities fraud, not directly implicating AI or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class action settlement of $10.1 million is fair, reasonable, and appropriate given the allegations of securities fraud related to misleading financial statements by Quintus Corporation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The United States District Court for the Northern District of California approved the settlement, finding it fair, reasonable, and adequate considering the high risk and cost of continued litigation, the limited resources from Quintus's bankruptcy estate, and the absence of objections from class members.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you invested in a company because they said they were doing really well, but then you found out they weren't honest about their finances, which made their stock price crash. Lots of people were upset and decided to sue the company. In the end, the company agreed to pay a big amount of money to all the people who lost money from buying their stocks. The judge checked to make sure this payout was fair, and nobody argued against it, so he said it was okay to go ahead with the plan.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.

See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.

Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04346-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion details the approval of a $10.1 million settlement in a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation, which provided eCRM solutions through AI software during 1999-2000. The case centers on the company's overstated financial statements, resulting in a class action lawsuit after Quintus’s stock value plummeted and the company went bankrupt. The court granted final approval of the settlement, including attorney fees, because the settlement terms were deemed fair and reasonable.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class settlement and the plan of allocation in a securities fraud lawsuit against Quintus Corporation were fair, reasonable, and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the proposed settlement and plan of allocation were fair, reasonable, and adequate. It also approved the award of attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses, determining them to be within reasonable limits and providing significant value to the class members.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A company called Quintus sold its stock to people in the late 1990s, promising great things with its computer software that helped businesses manage emails and customer relations. But then it was revealed that Quintus had not been truthful about its finances. The company's stock price dropped dramatically, and it went bankrupt, which upset a lot of people who had bought its stock. They went to court, and after years of legal tussle, the court decided on a fair way to divide the limited money left. It also made sure the lawyers didn’t charge too much for their work.

The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.

Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.

Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.

The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.

Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.

Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04528-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a consolidated securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation, a company primarily dealing with e-Customer Relationship Management software. Plaintiffs alleged that Quintus made false and misleading statements in its financial documents and securities offerings. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement for the plaintiffs and authorized the reimbursement of attorney fees and expenses. The case indirectly involves artificial intelligence through Quintus’s primary business in AI software.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement agreement and plan of allocation of the settlement fund in this securities fraud class action are fair, reasonable, and adequate under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the class settlement, concluding it to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. It also approved the plan of allocation and the application for the award of attorney fees and expenses, finding them reasonable in light of the litigation circumstances.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Quintus is a company that uses technology to help other businesses manage their customer interactions. They told people their business was doing better than it really was. When the truth came out, people who invested in the company lost a lot of money. These investors sued Quintus to get some of their money back. The court decided that the company should pay the investors $10.1 million to settle the issue, and everyone involved agreed that this was a good solution. The judge also made sure the lawyers got paid for their work in helping the investors get their money.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04650-VRW   Document 15   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.

Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.

Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation, which during the class period provided e-Customer Relationship Management (eCRM) solutions via its eContact software. After Quintus revealed overstated revenues and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, its share price collapsed, triggering a series of securities fraud lawsuits. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement agreement for the class members and granted attorney fees and expenses.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court should approve the proposed settlement and plan of allocation, as well as the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses, in the context of a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the settlement and plan of allocation, finding them to be fair, reasonable, and adequate based on factors such as the litigation's risk and cost, the settlement amount, and the absence of objections from class members. The court also approved the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses as reasonable.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company promised they made a lot more money than they actually did, and when people found out, the company's stock value crashed. Those who lost money from buying the stock got together to sue the company. The court decided on a plan that gives these people some money back, and the court made sure the plan was fair before giving it the green light. Similarly, the lawyers who worked hard on the case asked to be paid, and the court checked to make sure their payment was fair too.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.

Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:01-cv-00096-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

During the class period, Quintus was engaged in providing \"e-Customer Relationship Management\" solutions through their AI-based \"eContact\" software, and the company allegedly made false and misleading statements in their financial reports, leading to inflated stock prices. The court approved a settlement of $10.1 million to be distributed among investors who suffered losses due to the company's fraudulent activities, including a fair allocation plan and attorney fees.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue in this case was whether the class action settlement regarding claims of securities fraud against Quintus Corporation was fair, reasonable, and adequate for the affected investors.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the proposed class action settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. It granted final approval of the settlement, the allocation plan for the settlement fund, and the application for attorney fees and expenses.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if a company made grand promises about its finances to make its stock more appealing, but those promises weren't true. People bought stock thinking they were making a good investment. Later, when the truth came out, the stock's value collapsed, causing those investors to lose their money. The investors grouped together to sue the company for misleading them. The court thing is basically a big meeting where they agreed that the company should pay back $10 million to those who've lost money, ensuring everybody gets their fair share, and paid lawyers for their work on the case.",

After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.

See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware.

Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:01-cv-00270-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case concerns a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, a company originally involved in artificial intelligence software, accused of overstating its revenues during its initial public offering (IPO) period from 1999 to 2000. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement to be distributed among class members affected by the misleading financial statements. Additionally, the court granted the lead plaintiff’s and counsel’s application for attorney fees and expense reimbursement. AI technology was involved in the business operations of Quintus through their \"eCRM\" solutions at the time of the alleged financial misrepresentations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement for the securities fraud claims against Quintus Corporation is fair, reasonable, and adequate under the federal class action rules.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the $10.1 million class action settlement and the plan for allocating the settlement funds, concluding that it was fair, reasonable, and adequate. The court also approved the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you bought a toy because the company selling it promised it was super fun. Later, you find out the toy didn't do what they promised, and you're not the only one upset. So a bunch of you join forces to go to court and say, \"Hey, they tricked us!\" The company says, \"Okay, let's settle this.\" The judge in this case said, \"Yes, this deal is fair; the company will pay you back some money.\" The folks who led the charge in court (the lawyers) also get their costs covered since they worked hard to fix the problem for everyone.",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a securities fraud class action filed against Quintus Corporation, where plaintiffs alleged that false and misleading statements were made regarding the company's financial status during its initial public offering and other financial filings. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement to be distributed among class members who bought Quintus stock during the class period. The involvement of artificial intelligence in the case is evident as Quintus was engaged in developing AI software for e-Customer Relationship Management, which was central to the company's business operations and possibly relevant to the claims of misrepresentation of company value.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class settlement and plan for allocating settlement funds were fair, reasonable, and adequate under the terms of class action litigation rules and whether the claims of securities fraud under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were appropriately addressed.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of both the proposed class action settlement and the plan of allocation of funds. Additionally, the application for attorneys’ fees and reimbursement of expenses was approved as reasonable given the settlement in this complex class action case.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of Quintus as a company that had promised its shoes were the best in town, selling lots and making big money based on those claims. But it turned out that their shoes weren't as great as advertised, and people who invested lost money. The company and its investors came to an agreement to pay back $10.1 million to those who lost money, and the judge approved this decision because it was fair given the circumstances, like trying to share your allowance with your friends to make up for not telling them last week's secret. The fact that no one among the investors objected to the settlement showed that people were okay with how the money was being split.",

For the reasons discussed below, finalapproval of the class settlement and plan of allocation is GRANTEDand the application for award of attorney fees and reimbursement ofexpenses is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04313-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 1 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2I\nWhen Quintus was incorporated in 1984, its business was\nartificial intelligence software.  During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04313-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04313-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04313-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04313-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04313-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.

The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.

Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.

Quintus, originally an artificial intelligence software business, overstated its revenues, leading to a significant drop in stock prices and ultimately bankruptcy. The court grants final approval of a $10.1 million settlement, concluding that it is fair and reasonable given Quintus's financial condition and the absence of objections from class members.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class action settlement of securities fraud claims against Quintus Corporation is fair, reasonable, and adequate under the circumstances.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the settlement agreeing it was fair, reasonable, and adequate given the risk of further litigation, the financial condition of Quintus, the comprehensive settlement among various litigants, and due to no objections from class members.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: This is like realizing a company that made a big promise about its money situation was actually fibbing, and because of their lies, people who bought their stock lost a lot of money. So, a group of these people decided to sue the company and got some money back without going through a tough trial. The judge agreed that this resolution was fair, considering that no one in the group complained about the settlement.",

The parties have reached a settlement and now seek finalapproval of the proposed settlement and the proposed plan ofallocation.  Doc #274.

For the reasons discussed below, finalapproval of the class settlement and plan of allocation is GRANTEDand the application for award of attorney fees and reimbursement ofexpenses is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 1 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2I\nWhen Quintus was incorporated in 1984, its business was\nartificial intelligence software.  During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04392-VRW   Document 16   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. Summary: Joseph Lee Jones filed a lawsuit pro se against the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and others, claiming that the USPTO failed to provide him forms necessary to apply for patents on intellectual property related to artificial intelligence, including \"Fractal mathematics\" and other technologies, which he alleges Google wrongfully used. The court recommended dismissing Jones's case due to his ineligibility to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) and because his complaint failed to state a valid legal claim.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Jones qualifies for in forma pauperis status given his previous litigation history and whether his complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court recommended dismissing the case without prejudice due to Jones accumulating more than three strikes under the PLRA, thus disqualifying him from proceeding IFP, and because the complaint failed to state a plausible legal claim.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Joseph Lee Jones wanted to sue because he felt his ideas about computer technology were being used without permission, but he had not followed the right legal steps to file the case for free because he'd had too many unsuccessful lawsuits before. Plus, his paperwork didn't clearly show how his rights were being violated, so the court said he couldn't go forward with the case without paying a fee and fixing his case details.",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS  \n \nJOSEPH LEE JONES ,    \n   \n Plaintiff ,  \n   \n v.  \n   \nPATENTS AND TRADEMARK S \nCOMISSIONER ,     \n   \n Defendant . \n \n  \n \n     Case No.  21-4021 -KHV -ADM  \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION1 \n \nPro se p laintiff Joseph Lee Jones filed this case without paying the required filing fee.  \nThe court ordered him to pay the filing fee or show cause why his case should not be dismissed \nbecause it appears he is largely ineligible for in forma pauperis (“IFP”) status pursuant to the \nthree -strikes provision in 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g) .  (ECF 6.)  Jones responded by filing a motion for \nleave to proceed IFP and a response  in which he argues he is not a “prisoner” subject to the \nthree -strikes provis ion because he filed this case from Larned State Hospital (“Larned”)  rather \nthan a prison .  (ECF 7 & 10.)   Jones  misapprehend s the law.  He was a “prisoner” subject to the \nthree -strikes provision because, even if he was housed at Larned  temporarily , all available \ninformation suggests he was there on  pending criminal charges and not because of a civil \ncommitment order .  Accordingly, the court recommends  that the district judge dismiss this case \nbecause  Jones has not established that he is  entitled to proceed IFP, he did not pay the filing fee \nby the date ordered, and his complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . \n \n1 The court issues this Report and Recommendation  because denying a motion to proceed \nIFP is a dispositive  ruling .  Lister v. Dep’t of the Treasury , 408 F.3d 1309, 1312 (10th Cir. 2005) . Case 5:21-cv-04021-KHV-ADM   Document 15   Filed 05/18/21   Page 1 of 102 \n I. BACKGROUND  \nPortions of Jones’ complaint and attachments are virtually incomprehensible.  (ECF 1.)  \nHowev er, broadly construed, it appears that the factual allegations primarily relate to his efforts \nto obtain patent and/or trademark protection for what he contends is intellectual property that \nGoogle is wrongfully using.  The complaint lists Jones’ address  at Larned , and the clerk’s office \ndocketed the case with that address and  with Jones’ assigned inmate number.  (ECF 1, at 1.)  At \nthe time of filing, Jones did not pay the filing fee or file a motion for leave to proceed IFP.  Four \ndays after Jones  filed th is case, the clerk’s office docketed Jones’ notice of change of address , \nnoting his transfer to the Douglas County Jail.   (ECF 5.) \nOn April 14, the court ordered Jones to either (1) pay the filing fee  by May 15,  because  it \nappeared that Jones was a prisoner subject to the three -strikes provision under 28 U.S.C. § \n1915 (g) and therefore could not proceed IFP, or (2) show cause why his case should not be \ndismissed if he failed to pay the filing fee .  (ECF 6.)  On April 21, Jones filed a moti on for leave \nto proceed without prepayment of fees , and the court issued a Report and Recommendation that \nthe district judge deny the motion based on § 1915 (g).  (ECF 9 & 10.)   The following day, Jones \nfiled a response to the show -cause order .  (ECF 10.)  In it, he contends that he was not a \n“prisoner” within the meaning of the Prison Litigation Reform Ac t (“PLRA”)  at the time he filed \nsuit, and therefore § 1915 (g) does not bar him from proceeding  IFP in this action.   Because of \nJones’ allegat ions, the court withdrew its prior Report and Recommendation to issue a new \nReport and Recommendation that addresses Jones’ argument that he was not a “prisoner” under \nthe PLRA at the time he filed suit .  (ECF 11.)  Case 5:21-cv-04021-KHV-ADM   Document 15   Filed 05/18/21   Page 2 of 103 \n II. JONES IS BARRED UNDER THE PLRA’s THREE -STRIKES PROVISION  \nFROM PROCEEDING IFP IN THIS CASE  \nOne of the purposes of the  PLRA is to address  the “sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the \nfederal courts.”  Woodford v. Ngo,  548 U.S. 81, 84  (2006) .  Under the PLRA, prisoners obtain a \n“strike” against them for purposes of future IFP eligibility when their “action or appeal in a court \nof the United  States  . . . was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to \nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted [.]” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g); Childs v. Miller,  713 \nF.3d 1262, 1265 (10th Cir.  2013).  Once a prisoner accumulates three strikes, the court must \nrequire the prisoner to prepay the entire filing fee  “unless the prisoner is under imminent danger \nof serious physical injury .”  § 1915(g) ; Childs , 713 F.3d at 1265.   \nJones has accumulated more tha n three strikes  and his case does not involve any \nsuggestion that he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury.   Jones has brought at least \nfour civil cases or appeals that qualify as “strikes” —namely, Jones v. State of Kansas , D. Kan. \nCase No. 12-3229 -SAC ( dismissing complaint as frivolous and stating no claim for relief) , \nappeal dismissed (10th Cir. Aug. 14, 2014 ) (additional “strike” assessed); Jones v. Biltoft , D. \nKan. Case No. 14 -3041 -SAC ( dismissing complaint as frivolous); Jones v. U.S. Co pyright \nOffice , D. Kan. Case No. 14 -3078 -SAC ( dismissing complaint as stating no claim for relief); \nJones v. U.S. Copyright Office , D. Kan. Case No. 14 -3108 -SAC ( dismissing complaint as \nfrivolous, duplicative, and abusive).   Because of this, other judges in this district have previously \nfound  that Jones is subject to the three -strikes provision.  See, e,g ., Jones v. Crow , D. Kan. Case \nNo. 20 -3177 -HLT  (ECF 3 ); Jones v. Saul , D. Kan. Case No.  20-4008 -JAR (ECF 3 ); Jones v. \nUnited States Copyright Office and Pa tents , D. Kan. Case No. 15 - 3098 -SAC  (ECF 28 ). \nJones tries to circumvent this by arguing that he is not a prisoner because he did not file \nthis case from a jail or prison, and therefore § 1915(g)  does not apply.   But this argument Case 5:21-cv-04021-KHV-ADM   Document 15   Filed 05/18/21   Page 3 of 104 \n misunderstands the meaning of the term “prisoner” under the PLRA.  T he PLRA does not limit \nthe definition of “pris oner” to individuals housed in prison facilities .  Rather , the PLRA defines \n“prisoner” as “ any person incarcerated or detained in any facility  who is accused of, convicted \nof, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and \nconditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program.”  § 1915( h) (emphasis \nadded ).  Thus, t he determinative factor  is not whether the plaintiff  is currently housed in a prison \nbut whether the person is (1) “incarcerated or detained in any facility” and , if so, (2) whether the \nperson is being held as a result of criminal charges, convictions, a prison sentence, or violations \nof parole, probation , pretrial release , or diversion .  See Jackson v. Johnson , 475 F.3d 261, 265 \n(5th Cir. 2007 ) (plaintiff confined at a halfway house was a “ prisoner ” because he was there as \nthe result of a criminal conviction) .  For example,  the Second Circuit found that a plaintiff  who \nwas charged with a crime was a “prisoner ” under the PLRA even though he was later transferred \nto a mental health institution under a temporary observation order .  See Gibson v. City \nMunicipality of New York , 692 F.3d 198, 201 –02 (2d Cir. 2012 ).  The court had “little trouble” \nfinding the plaintiff met the definition of a “prisoner ” even though the temporary observation \norder effectively suspended , but did not terminate, the criminal action under New York law .  Id. \nIn contrast, a civil detainee is not a “prisoner” under the statute if the detainee is not \nfacing criminal charges while being held in custody .  See Merryfield v. Jordan , 584 F.3d 923, \n927 (10th Cir. 2009) (person civilly committed as a sexually violent predator was not a \n“prisoner” because the commitment was not the result of a violation of criminal law but rather \nwas based on a finding that he posed a future danger ; expressing “no opinion as to the \napplicability of PLRA’s fee  payment provision s to other types of civil commitments ”); compare  \nKalinowski v. Bond,  358 F.3d 978, 979 (7th Cir. 2004) ( plaintiff was a “prisoner” under the Case 5:21-cv-04021-KHV-ADM   Document 15   Filed 05/18/21   Page 4 of 105 \n PLRA where he was committed civilly unde r the Illinois Sexually Dangerous Persons Act \nbecause he was “a person charged with a felony, whose criminal proceedings [were] held in \nabeyance during treatment for mental illness” ; “Pretrial detainees are ‘prisoners’ for purposes of \nthe PLRA because they  are in custody while ‘accused of . . . violations of criminal law .”), with \nAndrews v. King , 398 F.3d 1113, 1121 –22 (9th Cir. 2005) ( plaintiff was not a “prisoner” under \nthe PLRA where he was held in Immigration and Naturalization Service custody and was not \nfacing criminal charges ”); Kolocotronis v. Morgan , 247 F.3d 726, 727 –28 (8th Cir. 2001) ( same, \nindividual housed in a state mental  facility pursuant to a finding that he was not guilty of a \ncriminal charge by reason of insanity).  \nHere, all available information suggests only that Jones was a “prisoner” under the PLRA \nwhen he filed this lawsuit because he was being held on pending cri minal charges .  At some \npoint, Jones  was detained in the Douglas County Jail on criminal charges in Case No. 2019 -CR-\n001075.  See Jones v. Bureau of Prisons , 21-3058 -SAC (ECF 4) (noting the pending criminal \ncharges) .  He was housed at the Douglas County Ja il in January 2021, when he was transferred \ndirectly from the jail to Larned.  See Jones v. Douglas County Sherriff’s Office , 20-2522 -SAC  \n(ECF 28 ) (plaintiff’s notice of change of address memorializing the move).  He filed this case on \nApril 8 , allegedly from Larned.  On April 12 , he filed another notice of change of address \nreflecting his move directly back to the Douglas County Jail.  (ECF 5.)2   Thus, it appears that \nJones was transferred to Larned while he was in custody on pending criminal charges.  Under \nKansas law, the court can order evaluation and treatment of a criminal defendant.  See KAN. \nSTAT. ANN. § 22-3303 (1).  But that does not mean that criminal charges have been dropped, and \n \n2 Jones filed another notice of change of address on May 17, which states that he is now \nhoused at the Shawnee County Jail.  (ECF 14.)  Case 5:21-cv-04021-KHV-ADM   Document 15   Filed 05/18/21   Page 5 of 106 \n it does not transform a criminal case into a civil commitment proceeding.  Indeed, Kansas law \ndoes not require that criminal charges be dismissed automatically even if the court orders the \nstate to commence invo luntarily commitment proceedings.  State v. Parker , 116 P.3d 759, 762 –\n63 (Kan. Ct. App. 2005 ) (finding the district court erred by dismissing the defendant’s criminal \ncase at the time it ordered commencement of involuntary commitment proceedings).  \nJones’s contention that he was civilly committed at the time he filed suit is not credible \ngiven the information available.  Jones has not produced any court order to show that the \ncriminal charges against him were dismissed before he filed this lawsuit .  He also has not \nproduced any records showing that his most recent transfer to Larned was the result of a civil \ncommitment rather than him being held in custody on pending criminal charges .  Although he \nproduced what appears to be the cover page to a separate two -page order issued in his criminal \ncase, it appears to cover a prior stay at Larned.  (ECF 13, at 7.)  The order is dated February 20, \n2020 .  But, as stated above, Jones filed this case when he was housed at Larned in January \nthrough April of 2 021.  The cover page provides no details about the commitment, and it does \nnot suggest that he was civilly committed.  To the contrary, the order indicates it was issued in \nJones’ criminal case .  And, as explained previously, determining whether a plaintif f meets the \ndefinition of a “prisoner ” under the PLRA depends on whether the plaintiff is accused of \nviolating criminal law.  See Gibson , 692 F.3d at 201 -02.   \nFor these reasons, Jones is barred from proceeding IFP in this case under the PLRA’s \nthree -strikes provision set forth in § 1915 (g).  Indeed, other judges in this district have previously \napplied the PLRA’s three -strikes provision to individuals housed at Larned, including Jones.  See \nJones , 21-3058 -SAC (ECF 4); see also Smith v. Rohling , No. CIV.A. 10-3184 -SAC, 2011 WL \n1326038, at *1 (D. Kan. Apr. 6, 2011 ); Parrish v. Kansas Dep ’t Of Corr. , No. CIV.A. 10 -3223 -Case 5:21-cv-04021-KHV-ADM   Document 15   Filed 05/18/21   Page 6 of 107 \n SAC, 2010 WL 4873584, at *1 (D. Kan. Nov. 23, 2010 ).  To the extent that the court has \nmisapprehended the nature of Jones’ confinement based on the limited record, Jones is free to \nobject to this Report and Recommendation by producing a civil commitment order or other \nrelevant court orders establishing th at he was not being held on pending criminal charges when \nhe filed this case.  But, unless he does so, the court recommends that the district judge deny \nJones’ motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss Jones’ case without prejudice \nfor fail ing to pay the filing fee by the court -ordered deadline of May 15.   \nIII. DISMISSAL -BASED SCREENING REQUIREMNETS  \nRegardless of whether Jones comes forward with the aforementioned orders, the court \nalso recommends that the district judge dismiss Jones’ complaint under § 1915(e)(2) for failure \nto state a claim , in which case his IFP motion should be denied as moot .  See Buchheit v. Green , \n705 F.3d 1157, 1160 –61 (10th Cir. 2012 ) (recognizing the district court’s discretion to screen a \ncomplaint before or after granting IFP status) ; see also Ruston v. Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter -Day Saints , 304 F. App’x 666, 668 (10th Cir. 2008) (declining to decide whether a civilly \ncommitt ed plaintiff was a “prisoner” subject to the three -strikes provision and instead dismissing \nthe case as frivolous  under § 1915(e)(2 )).  Proceeding  IFP “in a civil case is a privilege, not a \nright —fundamental or otherwise.”  White v. Colorado , 157 F.3d 1226, 1233 (10th Cir. 1998).   \n“Notwithstanding any filing fee, ” the court must dismiss the case at any time if  plaintiff’s \nallegation of poverty is untrue o r if the action frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim on which \nrelief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from an immune defendant.  § 1915(e)(2).  “Thus, \nin order to succeed on a motion to proceed IFP, the movant must show . . . the existence of a \nreasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised in the \naction. ”  Lister v. Dep ’t Of Treasury , 408 F.3d 1309, 1312 (10th Cir. 2005 ).   Case 5:21-cv-04021-KHV-ADM   Document 15   Filed 05/18/21   Page 7 of 108 \n Here, Jones ’ complaint does not demonstrate a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the \nlaw and facts in support of the issues he has raised in this action .  The complaint is nearly \nincomprehensible and fails to state a claim for relief.   In screening Jones’ complaint  to determine \nwhether it states a c laim, the court  applies the same standard it would apply to a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion to dismiss.  Kay v. Bemis , 500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 2007 ).  A “complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter,  accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the  reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.”  Id.  “Threadbare  recitals of the elem ents of a cause of action, supported by \nmere conclusory statements,” are  insufficient to state a claim for relief.  Id.   \nThe court must liberally construe a pro se plaintiff’s filings.  Hall v. Bellmon , 935 F.2d \n1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991).  However, the plaintiff still bears “the burden of alleging sufficient \nfacts on which a recognized legal claim could be based.”  Id.  “Dismissal of a pro se complaint \nfor failure to state a claim is proper only where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on \nthe facts he has alleged and it would be futile to give him an opportunity to amend .”  Gaines v. \nStenseng , 292 F.3d 1222, 1224 (10th Cir. 2002).  \nJones ’s complaint  does not identify any particular cause of action, although he checked \nboxes on the form that purport to invoke this court ’s federal -question jurisdiction based on the \ncase arising under the Constitution of the Unite d States —specifically, “Article one, Section 8; \nStatute, US Code Title 35, Section et seq.”  (ECF 1, at 3.)  He also checked the box indicating \nthat federal -question jurisdiction is premised on  28 U.S.C.  § 1343, and he st ates that additional \njurisdictional grounds include his First Amendment right to practice his religion and to patent Case 5:21-cv-04021-KHV-ADM   Document 15   Filed 05/18/21   Page 8 of 109 \n and trademark intellectual property.  ( Id.)  Broadly construed, Jones  alleges that the U.S. Patent \nand Trademark Office  (“USPTO”)  failed to provide him with form s to file his patents for \nartificial intelligence, including “Fractal mathematics” and the “Fractal Bible for Christian \nTranshumanism ,” and the “intelligence amplifier  (interface to the soul).”  (ECF 1, at 3.)   He \nrequests th at the court order the USPTO to produce the documents and alleges that Google is \nsomehow using his material to “teach people” after it shut down Jones’ website. (Id. at 4.)   \nThese allegations do not provide a sufficient  factual basis to raise a right to relief above \nthe speculative level.   Jones merely states a grievance —not receiving unspecified documents for \nhim to apply for patent  and trademark protection —without tying that grievance to any \nrecognized legal claim that  would provide a right to relief .  Although Jones checked boxes on the \nform complaint alleging a violation of his constitutional  and civil  rights, he has not pleaded any \nfacts that would support any violation of those rights .  For these reasons, the court recommends \nthat the district judge also dismiss this case pursuant to  § 1915(e)(2) because Jones fails to state a \nclaim on which relief can be granted.  As a result, his motion to proceed without prepayment of \nfees should be denied as moot . \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nThis is but one in a long line of unmeritorious cases Jones has filed in this district .  The \ncourt believes that he meets the definition of “prisoner” under the PLRA, but his complaint is \nfatally flawed regardless.  Therefore, f or the reasons ex plained above, the court recommends that \nthe district judge dismiss this case without prejudice because  Jones  has not established that he is \nentitled to proceed IFP, he did not pay the required filing fee by the court -ordered deadline of \nMay 15, and his complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  C onsequently, \nhis motion for leave to proceed IFP should also be denied.

    "summary": "1. Summary: This opinion pertains to a securities class action lawsuit involving Innodata Inc., a company accused of issuing false or misleading statements regarding its AI technology. The court reviewed competing motions to appoint a lead plaintiff and counsel, ultimately selecting Francis Grondin over Curtis Gardner, based on his larger financial losses and compliance with legal procedural requirements.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: The key legal issue is the appointment of the lead plaintiff in a securities class action under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA). The court needed to determine which plaintiff was most capable of representing the class's interests.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that Francis Grondin has the largest financial interest and satisfies the relevant legal requirements under Rule 23, making him the presumptive lead plaintiff. The court appointed Grondin as lead plaintiff and approved his choice of lead and local counsel.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation: This court case is about deciding who should lead a group lawsuit involving a company that allegedly lied about its artificial intelligence technology. The court chose Francis Grondin to be in charge since he lost more money than the other candidate and followed all the rules to qualify. Think of it as picking a team captain for a group trying to get their money back from a company that wasn't honest.",

(ECF 4; ECF 6.) Both Grondin and Gardner filed opposition briefs. (ECF 10, \n“Grondin Opp.” and ECF 11, “Gardner Opp.”) Both Grondin and Gardner filed reply briefs. (ECF \n14, “Gardner Reply” and ECF 15 , “Grondin Reply.”) The Court considered the parties’ \nsubmissions and decided the motions without oral argument pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 78(b) and Local Civil Rule 78.1(b). For the reasons stated herein, Grondin’s motion for \nappointment as lead plaintiff and approval of counsel (ECF 4) is GRANTED, and Gardner’s  \nmotion for appointment as lead plaintiff and approval of counsel (ECF 6) is DENIED.  I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \n This is a  putative federal securities class action brought on behalf of all those who \npurchased or otherwise acquired Innodata Inc. common stock during the period from May 9, 2019 \nthrough February 14, 2024, inclusive (the “Class Period”), who were damaged thereby (the Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 1 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>2 \n “Class”). (ECF 1, Compl. ¶ 1.)  This action is brought on behalf of the Class for violations of \nSections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ( Id.)  \nDefendant Innodata is a global data engineering company that purports to be “delivering \nthe promise of  [artificial intelligence, referred to as]  AI[,] to many of the world’s most prestigious \ncompanies.” ( Id. ¶ 2.) Innodata states that it provides AI -enabled software platforms and managed \nservices for AI data collection/annotation, AI digital transformation, and industry- specific business \nprocesses. ( Id.) Plaintiffs allege that Defendants Innodata, Jack Abuhoff, Mark Spelker, and \nMarissa Espineli  made false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material \nfacts regarding, among other things, Innodata’s AI technology and use of AI. ( Id. ¶ 3.)  \n On February 21, 2024, Plaintiff David D’Agostino filed the Complaint individually and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated. (ECF 1.) On April 22, 2024, both Plaintiff Francis Grondin \nand Plaintiff Curtis Gardner  filed a motion to appoint lead plaintiff and lead  counsel . (ECF 4; ECF \n6.) The Court now considers both motions.  \nII. APPOINTMENT OF LEAD PLAINTIFF  \nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (“PSLRA”) directs the Court to appoint as \nlead plaintiff “the member or members of the purported plaintiff class that the court determines to be [the] most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members[.]” 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(i). As relevant here,  \nI. In general. . . . the court shall adopt a presumption that the most adequate \nplaintiff in any private action arising under this title is the person or group of \npersons that –  \n(aa) has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a  \nnotice under subparagraph (A)(i);  \n(bb) in the determination of the court, has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class; and  Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 2 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>3 \n (cc) otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure.   \nII. Rebuttal evidence. The presumption described in subclause (I) may be rebutted only upon proof by a member of the purported plaintiff class that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff —  \n(aa) will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class; or  \n(bb) is subject to unique defenses that render such plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.  \n \n15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(a)(3)(B)(iii).  \nAs stated in subsection (a)(3)(I)(cc), the “most adequate plaintiff” must also satisfy the \nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23:  \nOne or more members of a class may sue  or be sued as representative parties \non behalf of all members only if:  \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;  \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;  \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and  \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.  \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).  \nA.   Largest Financial Interest  \nThe Third Circuit has been clear that “[i]n appointing a lead plaintiff, the court’s first duty \nis to identify the movant that is presumptively entitled to that status. The process begins with the \nidentification of the movant with ‘the largest financial in terest in the relief sought by the class.’”  \nIn re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d 201, 262 (3d Cir. 2001) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(bb)). In doing so, “[c]ourts  have discretion to appoint an investor with the largest \nstake in the litigation.” Roby v. Ocean Power Techs., Inc., No. 14- 3799, 2015 WL 1334320, at *5 \n(D.N.J. Mar. 17, 2015) (citing In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 262). “The Third Circuit has concluded that ‘largest financial interest’ means the largest loss.” Roby , 2015 WL 1334320, at *5 Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 3 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>4 \n (citing In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 223); see also In re Able Labs. Sec. Litig., 425 F. \nSupp. 2d. 562, 567 (D.N.J. 2006) (same). In making this determination, “courts should consider, \namong other things: (1) the number of shares that the movant purchased during the putative class period; (2) the total net funds expended by the plaint iffs during the class period; and (3) the \napproximate losses suffered by the plaintiffs.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 262.  To that \nend, district courts w ithin the Third Circuit “have accorded the third element, the largest financial \nloss, the greatest weight.” Roby , 2015 WL 1334320, at *5 (collecting cases). \nHere, Grondin suffered $27,798.69 in losses. ( See ECF 4.) Gardner suffered $24,426.00 in \nlosses.  (See ECF 6.) Although Grondin suffered a greater loss than Gardner, Gardner argues that \nhe should be appointed lead plaintiff because he purchased and retained more shares than Grondin \nand expended greater funds. (Gardner Opp. at 3.) However, courts within the Third Circuit consider the approximate loss suffered to be the most important factor when assessing the l argest \nfinancial interest. Stires v. Eco Sci. Sols., Inc., No. 17- 3707, 2018 WL 5784817, at *4 (D.N.J. Feb. \n14, 2018)  (citing Roby , 2015 WL 1334320, at *5, *14) . The parties agree that Grondin sustained \n$27,798.69 in losses  and Gardner sustained $24,426.00 in losses . (Gardner Opp. at 3; Grondin \nReply at 2.) Accordingly, Grondin has the “largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class” and will be the presumptive most adequate plaintiff if he  “otherwise satisfies” the typicality \nand adequacy requirements of Rule 23. \nB.  Rule 23 Requirements  \n“Once the court has identified the movant with ‘the largest financial interest in the relief \nsought by the class,’ it should then turn to the question whether that movant ‘otherwise satisfies the requirements of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,’ and is thus the presumptively most adequate plaintiff.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 263- 64 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 78u-Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 4 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>5 \n 4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I) (cc)). This “inquiry . . . should be confined to determining whether the movant \nhas made a prima facie showing of typicality and adequacy.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 263. This assessment “should be a product of the court’s independent judgment,” but “need not be extensive.” Id. at 263- 64. “In conducting the initial inquiry as to whether the movant with the \nlargest losses satisfies the typicality and adequacy requirements, the court may and should consider the pleadings that have been filed, the movant’s application, and any other information that the court requires to be submitted.” Id.  at 264. “When making these determinations, courts should \napply traditional Rule 23 principles.” Id.  at 264 -65.  \nSpecifically,  \nin inquiring whether the movant has preliminarily satisfied the \ntypicality requirement, they should consider whether the circumstances of the movant with the largest losses “are markedly different or the legal theory upon which the claims [of that movant] are based differ[] from that upon which the claims of other class members will perforce be based.”  \n \nIn assessing whether the movant satisfies Rule 23’s adequacy requirement, courts should consider whether it “has the ability and incentive to represent the claims of the class vigorously, [whether it] has obtained adequate counsel, and [whether] there is [ a] conflict \nbetween [the movant’s] claims and those asserted on behalf of the class.”  \n \nId. at 265 (alterations in original) (quoting Hassine v. Jeffes , 846 F.2d 167, 177, 179 (3d Cir. 1988)). \n“In making the initial adequacy assessment in this context, courts should also . . . inquire whether \nthe movant has demonstrated a willingness and ability to select competent class counsel and to negotiate a reason able retainer agreement with that counsel.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d \nat 265.   First, the typicality requirement is satisfied when the named plaintiff has (1) suffered the \nsame injuries as the absent class members, (2) as a result of the same course of conduct by Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 5 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>6 \n defendants, and (3) their claims are based on the same legal issues. Blake Partners, Inc. v. \nOrbcomm, Inc., No. 07- 4590, 2008 WL 2277117, at *6 (D.N.J. June 2, 2008) (citing Weiss v. York \nHosp., 745 F.2d 786, 809 & n.36 (3d Cir. 1984)). Here, Grondin’s  claims are based on the same \nlegal theory and arise from the same events and course of conduct as the claims of the class. ( See, \ne.g., Grondin Reply at 5- 7 (“Grondin alleges, ‘as do all putative class members, that Defendants \nviolated federal securities laws during the Class Period by making false or misleading statements of material facts, or omitting to state material facts, ’ and that he purchased or otherwise acquired \nInnodata securities during the Class Period at prices artificially inflated by Defendants’ wrongful conduct and suffered damages as a result thereof. ”).) At this stage of appointing lead plaintiff \npursuant to the PSLRA, the Court finds that Grondin satisfies Rule 23’s  typicality requirement.  \nSecond, the adequacy requirement is satisfied if “both the class representative and its \nattorneys are capable of satisfying their obligations, and neither has interests conflicting with those of other class members.” Lifestyle Investments, LLC v. Amicus Therapeutics , No. 15- 7448, 2016 \nWL 3032684, at *7 (internal quotations omitted) (quoting Smith v. Suprema Specialties , 206 F. \nSupp. 2d 627, 633 (D.N.J. 2002)); see also In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 265 (“In assessing whether the movant satisfies R ule 23’s adequacy requirement, courts should consider \nwhether [the movant] ‘has the ability and incentive to represent the claims of the class vigorously, [whether the movant] has obtained adequate counsel, and [whether] there is [a] conflict between [the movant’s] claims and those asserted on behalf of the class.’” (quoting Hassine , 846 F.2d at \n179)). Here, Grondin, like the other members of the proposed class, seeks to recover the losses he  \nincurred as a result of Defendants’  alleged unlawful conduct. Additionally, given his  financial \nlosses, Grondin appears interested in vigorously pursuing the asserted claims and has retained \ncompetent and experienced counsel to that end. Furthermore, there does not appear to be a conflict Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 6 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>7 \n between Grondin’s  claims and those of the purported class. At this stage of appointing lead plaintiff \npursuant to the PSLRA, the Court finds Grondin satisfies Rule 23’s  adequacy requirement.  \nC.   Timeliness of Motion  \nIn determining whether a potential lead plaintiff has “either filed the complaint or made a \nmotion in response to a notice,” 15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(aa), the PSLRA explains that  \nNot later than 20 days after the date on which the complaint is filed, \nthe plaintiff or plaintiffs shall cause to be published, in a widely circulated national business -oriented publication or wire service, a \nnotice advising members of the purported plaint iff class — \n \n(I) of the pendency of the action, the claims asserted therein, and the purported class period; and  \n(II) that, not later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is published, any member of the purported class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff of the purported class.  \n If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the same claim or claims arising under this chapter is filed, only the plaintiff or plaintiffs in the first filed action shall be required to cause \nnotice to be published[.]  \n \n15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(a)(3)(A)(i)- (ii). Accordingly, a movant must have either (1) “filed the \ncomplaint” or (2) made a motion in response to the notice associated with the first -filed complaint \n“not later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is publ ished.” See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-\n4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(aa). Here, Grondin did not file the Complaint. Therefore, Grondin must have \nmade a motion in response to the notice associated with the C omplaint in accordance with Section \n78u-4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(aa). On Febru ary 21, 2024, notice was published in connection with the  \nComplaint . (ECF 4- 4.) Accordingly, Grondin had sixty days to move in response to the notice . The \nnotice stated that motion s to appoint lead plaintiff  had to be filed by Monday, April 22, 2024.\n1 (See \n \n1 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(1)(C) (“ The following rules apply in computing any time period . . . [w]hen the \nperiod is stated in days . . . include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, \nthe period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. ”). Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 7 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>8 \n ECF 4 -4, Ex. A.) Grondin so moved. (ECF 4.) Therefore, Grondin timely filed a motion for \nappointment as lead plaintiff in compliance with the PSLRA.2 15 U.S.C. § 78u-\n4(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I)(aa).  \nD.  Presumption of Lead Plaintiff  \n“Once a presumptive lead plaintiff is located, the court should then turn to the question \nwhether the presumption has been rebutted.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 268. However, \n“[i]f no class member succeeds in rebutting the presumption, then the district court should appoint \nthe presumptive lead plaintiff as the lead plaintiff.”  Id. Presently, there is no compelling challenge \nto the appointment of Grondin as lead plaintiff. Accordingly, the presumption of adequacy stands. \nSee, e.g., Arbitrage Fund v. Toronto- Dominion Bank , No. 23- 2763, 2023 WL 5550198, at *5 \n(D.N.J. Aug. 29, 2023) (finding presumption of adequacy must stand where no challenges were made); In re Party City Sec. Litig. , 189 F.R.D. 91, 112 (D.N.J. 1999) (“Absent such a challenge, \nthe presumption of adequacy will generally survive.”); Zuckerman v. Foxmeyer Health Corp., No. \n96-2258, 1997 WL 314422, at *2 (N.D. Tex. Mar. 26, 1997) (“No purported class member has \npresented evidence to rebut this presumption. Therefore, the Court will appoint the movants as \nlead plaintiffs.”).  \nGrondin appears to have the largest financial interest, satisfied the Rule 23 requirements, \nand filed a timely motion. The presumption that Grondin is the most adequate plaintiff has not \nbeen rebutted. For these reasons, the Court will appoint Grondin as lead plaintiff, and his  motion \n(ECF 4) is GRANTED.  \n \n \n2 In re Sequans Communs. S.A. Sec. Litig. , 289 F. Supp. 3d 416, 420 (E.D.N.Y . 2018) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. \n6(a)(1)(C) and noting that 60 -day period ended on October 10, 2017 when notice was filed on August 9, 2017 because \nOctober 9, 2017 was a federal holiday).  Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 8 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>9 \n III. APPOINTMENT OF LEAD COUNSEL  \n15 U.S.C. § 78u- 4(a)(3)(B)(v) provides that “[t]he most adequate plaintiff shall, subject to \nthe approval of the court, select and retain counsel to represent the class.” Because the Court finds Grondin to be the most ade quate plaintiff, this task falls to him . Grondin moved for approval of \nBlock & Leviton LLP a s Lead Counsel, and Carella, Byrne, Cecchi, Brody & Agnello, P.C. as \nLocal Counsel . (ECF 4.)   \nThere is “a strong presumption in favor of approving a properly- selected lead plaintiff's \ndecisions as to counsel selection and counsel retention.” In re Cendant Corp. Litig., 264 F.3d at 276. “When a properly- appointed lead plaintiff asks the court to approve its choice of lead counsel \nand of a retainer agreement, the question is not whether the court believes that the lead plaintiff could have made a better choice or gotten a better deal.” Id.  Rather, “the court’s inquiry is \nappropriately limited to whether the lead plaintiff’s selection and agreement with counsel are reasonable on their own terms.” Id.  The Third Circuit considers the following factors in deciding \nwhether the selection of lead plaintiff’s counsel is appropriate: (1) the quantum of legal experience and sophistication possessed by the lead plaintiff; (2) the manner in which the lead plaintiff chose what law firms to consider; (3) the process by which the lead plaintiff selected its final choice; (4) the qualifications and experience of counsel selected by the lead plaintiff; and (5) the evidence that the retainer agreement negotiated by the lead plaintiff was (or was not) the product of serious negotiations between the lead plaintiff and the prospective lea d counsel. Id. at 27. \nGrondin’s  chosen law firms have prosecuted numerous securities fraud class actions on \nbehalf of investors. ( See ECF 4- 8, Ex. E ; ECF 4 -9, Ex. F .) After reviewing the firms’ resumes, the \nCourt finds that both firms have substantial experience litigating securities fraud class actions and are thus “competent to fulfill the duties of lead counsel and liaison counsel.” Lewis v. Lipocine Case 2:24-cv-00971-JKS-JSA     Document 32     Filed 10/30/24     Page 9 of 10 PageID:\n<pageID>10 \n Inc., No. 16- 4009, 2016 WL 7042075, at *5 (D.N.J. Dec. 2, 2016).  As a result, Grondin’s motion \nto appoint lead counsel is GRANTED.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  For the reasons stated above, Grondin’s motion for appointment as lead plaintiff and \napproval of counsel (ECF 4) is GRANTED, and Gardner’s  motion for appointment as lead \nplaintiff and approval of counsel (ECF 6) is DENIED.  \n An appropriate order follows. \n/s/ Jamel K.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Thomas Gray suing Experian Information Solutions, Inc. for allegedly inaccurately reporting his credit history, which he claims led to damages including denied credit and emotional distress. Gray contended that Experian failed to correct inaccuracies despite multiple disputes, asserting a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). However, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Experian, as Gray failed to provide admissible evidence showing inaccurate credit reporting or that he suffered damages due to these alleged inaccuracies. The case mentions the use of AI in the context of a disputed transcribed phone call used as evidence by Gray, but the court found it inadmissible.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Experian violated the FCRA by failing to ensure the accuracy of Gray's credit report and causing him damages as a result.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Gray failed to provide sufficient evidence of inaccuracies in his credit report, Experian’s failure to follow reasonable procedures, and any consequential damages. Thus, Experian was entitled to summary judgment on Gray's FCRA claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Thomas Gray thought Experian made mistakes in his credit report, leading to problems like denied credit cards and stress. He sued Experian, claiming they didn't fix these errors even after he asked them to. But when it came time to prove his case, Gray didn't have enough solid evidence to show there were mistakes or that his troubles were caused by Experian's reports. The court said Gray couldn’t win because he didn't show enough proof, so they decided in favor of Experian without a trial. AI came up because Gray used a computer program to transcribe a phone call as evidence, but the court said it wasn't reliable enough to count.",
    "full_text": "1 \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS  \nAUSTIN DIVISION  \n \nTHOMAS GRAY , §   \n § \n Plaintiff, § \n  § \nv. §   1 :23-CV-545-RP \n  §    \nEXPERIAN INFORMATION SOLUTIONS,  § \nINC. ,  § \n §  \n Defendant. § \n \nORDER  \n Before the Court is Defendan t Experian Information Solutions, Inc.’s (“Experian”) motion \nfor summary judgment, (Dkt. 23), and responsive briefing. Having considered the parties’ briefs, the \nrecord, and the relevant law, the Court will grant Experian’s motion.  \nAs an initial matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff Thomas Gray  (“Gray ”), proceeding pro se , \nfiled multiple filings in response to  Experian’s motion. Experian’s motion was filed on July 15, 2024. \n(Dkt. 23). Gray filed an initial response  on July 26 , (Dkt. 26), and in response, Experian  filed a reply  \non August 2 , (Dkt. 27). The Court considers both filings  as properly filed . However, twelve days \nafter Experian filed its reply, Gray then filed a second document labeled as a response, (Dkt. 28), and an affidavit, (Dkt. 29). These latter two documents were untimely and improperly filed without permission of the Court. See W.D. Tex. Loc. R. CV-7(d) (noting that responses to non-discovery or \ncase management motions are due 14 days after the filing of the motion); Id.  CV-7(e) (noting that \n“no further submissions” on a motion other than response and reply briefs “are allowed” without Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 1 of 102 \n “leave of court ”). Accordingly, the Court does not consider Gray’s second response and affidavit, \n(Dkts. 28, 29) , and will strike them from the docket.1 \nI. BACKGROUND  \nGray filed suit against Experian asserting that Experian had reported inaccurate and \nincomplete information about Gray to third parties through its business of preparing consumer \ncredit reports. (Dkt. 1). In his complaint,  Gray alleges that Experian inaccurately and incorrectly \nreported that Gray had a history of delinquent payments . (Id. ¶ 6). Specifically, in his deposition, \nGray testified that he disputes the veracity of three accounts: an Apple credit card, a Chase auto \nloan, and a Capital One credit card.  (Gray Dep. Tr., Dkt. 23- 1, at 15:19–17:17).  Gray asserts  that th e \nallegedly inaccurate reporting caused  him damages, including “ denied credit opportunities, emotional \ndistress, damage to reputation and standing in the community. ” (Compl., Dkt. 1, ¶ 8).  \nGray filed his complaint in this case on May 16, 2023. (Dkt. 1). Gray brings one count for \nviolation of Section 1681e(b) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), 15 U.S.C. § 1681e(b). ( Id. \nat 2). Gray also alleges that Experian ac ted intentionally and willfully. ( Id.). Gray seeks actual \ndamages, punitive damages, and attorney’s fees. ( Id.). Experian moves for summary judgment on \nGray’s FCRA claim. (Dkt. 23).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nSummary judgment is appropriate under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nonly “if the movant shows there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A dispute is genuine only if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 254 (1986). “A fact issue is ‘material’ if its resolution could affect the \n \n1 Even if these filings were properly filed, the Court finds that they  do not contain argument or evidence that \nwould create a genuine issue of material fact on Gray’s FCRA claim.  Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 2 of 103 \n outcome of the action.” Poole v. City of Shreveport , 691 F.3d 624, 627 (5th Cir. 2012).  \n The party moving for summary judgment bears the initial burden of “informing the district \ncourt of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes \ndemonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). “[T]he moving party may [also] meet its burden by simply pointing to an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.” Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co ., 402 F.3d 536, 544 \n(5th Cir. 2005). The burde n then shifts to the nonmoving party to establish the existence of a \ngenuine issue for trial. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585–87 (1986); Wise v. E.I. Dupont de Nemours & Co. , 58 F.3d 193, 195 (5th Cir. 1995). After the nonmovant \nhas been given the opportunity to raise a genuine factual issue, if no reasonable juror could find for the nonmovant, summary judgment will be granted.  Miss. River Basin Alliance v. Westphal, 230 F.3d \n170, 175 (5th Cir. 2000). Courts must v iew the summary judgment evidence in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmovant. Rosado v. Deters , 5 F.3d 119, 123 (5th Cir. 1993).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n Experian argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because Gray has not provided \nevidence to support all elements of his FCRA claim. (Dkt. 23). Section 1681e(b) of the FCRA provides: “ Whenever a consumer reporting agency prepares a consumer report it shall follow \nreasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates. ” 15 U.S.C. § 1681e(b). Section  1681n(a) creates a private \nright of action for willful noncompliance with the FCRA , and Section 1681o(a) provides a private \nright of action for negligent noncompliance with the FCRA. To prove negligent noncompliance \nwith § 1681e(b), Gray must establish four elements:  (1) inaccurate information was included in his \ncredit report; (2) the inaccuracy was due to Experian’s failure to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy; (3) Gray  suffered injury; and (4) Gray’s  injury was caused by the Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 3 of 104 \n inclusion of the inaccurate entry. Zala v. Trans Union, LLC , 2001 WL 210693,  at *3 (N.D. Tex. Jan. \n17, 2001). The Court will take each element in turn.  \nA. Inaccurate Information \n The threshold question is whether Gray has demonstrated that his credit report contains \ninaccurate information. See Potter v. GreenSky, LLC , 2019 WL 5295494,  at *2 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 18, \n2019) . The Court finds that Gray has not done so as to the three accounts he is disputing.  \nFirst, Gray disputes the accuracy of the reporting on his Apple credit card. The only \nevidence that Gray points  to his November 11, 2023 Dispute Letter (“Dispute Letter”), which \ncontains a print -out of his Experian credit report with Gray’s annotations indicating where he \nbelieves there is missing or inaccurate information. (Resp., Dkt. 26, at 2; Dispute Letter, Dkt. 23- 3, \nat 20 –21). Such evidence is conclusory and does not demonstrate that the reporting on the Apple \ncard is inaccurate. Gray’s “unverified, unsubstantiated, and self -serving allegations simply cannot be \nthe basis of a genuine issue of material fact.” See Foster v. Cerliano , 2008 WL 5158576,  at *7 (E.D. \nTex. Dec. 9, 2008) (citing Vais Arms, Inc. v. Vais , 383 F.3d 287, 294 (5th Cir. 2004) ). Accordingly, the \nApple credit card cannot support Gray’s FCRA claim.  \nSimilarly, Gray disputes the accuracy of the reporting on his Capital One credit card. (Gray \nDep. Tr., Dkt. 23- 1, at 17:7–9). However, again, the only evidence that Gray presents to support this \nallegation is the annotations that he placed on his credit report, alleging that there was missing or \ninaccurate information as to the Capitol One a ccount. (Resp., Dkt. 26, at 2; Dispute Letter, Dkt. 23-\n3, at 22–24). On the other hand, Experian has produced evidence demonstrating the accuracy of the reporting. Exper ian has issued Automated Consumer Dispute Verifications (“ACDV”), which have \nconfirmed that the reporting of the card is accurate. ( See Ex. 5, at 3; Ex. 6). Because Gray’s \nconclusory allegations cannot create a genuine issue of material fact as to the accuracy of the reporting of the Capitol One account, this account also cannot support his FCRA claim.  Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 4 of 105 \n Third , Gray disputes the accuracy of the reporting on his Chase auto loan. (Gray Dep. Tr., \nDkt. 23- 1, at 17:3). As of December 2023, Gray’s credit report indicated that he paid t his loan 30 \ndays late for the months of January 2022, January 2023, and September 2023. (Ex. 2, Dkt. 23- 2, at \n5). Gray, however, alleges that this information is inaccurate because he paid this loan on  time. \n(Resp., Dkt. 26, at 1–2).  \nIn support, Gray points to a “transcribed phone call” with Chase that he argues \ndemonstrates that this account was not delinquent in January 2023 and January 2024. (Dispute \nLetter, Dkt. 23 -3, at 7–8).  Experian disputes the veracity of this “transcribed phone call” and \nwhether the phone call supports Gray’s argument. (Mot., Dkt. 23, at 8 & n.7; Reply, Dkt. 27, at 6). The Court agrees  with Experian . The transcription is a one -and-a-half-page document that identifies \nan alleged conversation that Gray had with a Chase employee simply identified as “Chase.”  (See \nDispute Letter, Dkt. 23 -3, at 7 –8). The document does not identify the date or time of this alleged  \nconversation. Nor does the document contain any other information verifying that it is an accurate \ndepiction of the alleged conversation.  Instead, there is an indication that the transcription is the \nresult of an artificial intelligence program. ( Id. at 8).  This “transcribed phone call” is unverified and \nunauthenticated. Thus, it is not admissible summary judgment evidence. Oliver v. U.S. Dept. of Defense , \n44 F. Supp. 2d 821, 824–25 (W.D. Tex. 1999).   \nFurther, e ven assuming that the phone call is admissible, it does not support Gray’s \nperspective. In the alleged call, Gray asks the Chase employee what Chase is reporting for the month of January 2021. (Dispute Letter, Dkt. 23- 3, at 7). In response , the alleged  Chase  employee states \nthat Gray had a payment due date of January 11. The employee explains that Chase processed \nGray’s payment on February 9. Therefore, his payment was late , but Chase did not issue a \ndelinquency report because Chase only issues those reports if a payment is 30 days past due. Gray then inquires about January 2023 , and the Chase employee  makes similar remarks as to that Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 5 of 106 \n payment. ( Id. at 7–8). Assuming that the transcription accurately reflects Gray’s payment history, all \nit states is that Chase processed Gray’s payments within the 30 -day window of Gray’s payment dates \nin January 2022 and January 2023. This call does not indicate whether t he January 2022 and January \n2023 payments were applied to Gray’s account  and therefore whether they were ultimately timely.  In \naddition, the transcription does not even address the third disputed month—September 2023.  \nIn fact, Experian presents evidence indicating that in October 2023, Gray received a letter \nfrom Chase , presumably in response to the  September 2023 payment . (Id. at 3–4). The letter \nacknowledg ed that Chase  had processed a payment but that the payment was “returned . . . unpaid.” \n(Id.). A payment that was processed within the 30 -day window but was later returned and not \napplied to the account  in that timeframe  is 30 day s late. Thus, this letter demonstrates that at least \non one occasion—and specifically as to the September 2023 payment, which Gray disputes —the \nprocessing of Gray’s payments did not ultimately result in the payment being applied to the account.  \nExperian also presents evidence that it conducted two investigations into the veracity of the \nnegative reporting on the Chase account. (Ex. 4 , Dkt. 23- 4; Ex. 5, Dkt. 23- 5). Both times Chase \nverified the accuracy of the three 30 -day delinquencies. ( Id.). Gray’s “transcribed phone call” does \nnot contradict the results of these investigations  because it is inadmissible, it does not address the \nSeptember 2023 payment, and even as to the January payments, it does not demonstrate that Gray’s \npayments were applied  to his account.  Gray presents no other evidence by which a reasonable jury \ncould conclude that Gray was not delinquent on the Chase account. Accordingly, the Chase account also cannot support  his FCRA claim.  \nBecause Gray has failed to provide any evidence that would allow a trier of fact to find that \nhis credit reports contained inaccurate information, the Court concludes that he has failed to raise a Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 6 of 107 \n genuine issue of material fact on this point.2 As a result, Experian is entitled to summary judgment \non this  threshold element.  \nB. Reasonable Procedures  \n Section 1681e(b) of the FCRA provides that “[w]henever a consumer reporting agency \nprepares a consumer report it shall follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible \naccuracy of the information concerning the individual about whom the report relates.” 15 U.S.C. § 1681e(b). This Section does not impose strict lia bility for inaccuracies, “but only a duty of  reasonable \ncare in preparation of the report.” Thompson v. San Antonio Retail Merchs. Ass ’n, 682 F.2d 509, 513 (5th \nCir. 1982). It is Gray’s  burden to show that the inaccuracy resulted from “a negligent or willf ul \nfailure to use reasonable procedures.” Sepulvado v. CSC Credit Services, Inc. , 158 F.3d 890, 895 (5th Cir. \n1998). “The standard of conduct by which the trier of fact must judge the adequacy of agency procedures is what a reasonably prudent person would do under the circumstances.” Thompson , 682 \nF.2d at 513 (citing Bryant v. TRW, Inc. , 487 F. Supp. 1234, 1242 (E.D. Mich. 1980)). \n In his response, Gray argues that Experian failed to follow reasonable procedures because it \ndid not correct inaccuracies after Gray provided documentation that his credit report contained inaccurate information. (Resp., Dkt. 26, at 4–5). Gray also argues that Experian’s reliance on the ACDVs was improper because in doing so, Experian did not conduct its own inde pendent \ninvestigation. ( Id.). However, the evidence demonstrates that Experian  did reasonably investigat e \nGray’s disputes and repeatedly confirmed with the credit furnishers —Apple, Capitol One, and \nChase —that Gray’s information was accurate. ( See Ex. 4, Dkt. 23- 4; Ex. 5, Dkt. 23- 5; Ex. 6, Dkt. 23-\n \n2 In his response, Gray also seems to dispute the reporting on five  other accounts: a First Progressive credit \ncard, a Self Financial/Lead Bank credit car d, a Navy Federal Credit Union account, a One Nevada Credit \nUnion account, and a Santander/Chrysler Capital account. (Resp., Dkt. 26, at 2 –3). Assuming that these \nallegations are even properly part of this suit, these accounts also cannot support his FCRA claim because the \nonly evidence Gray produces to support his allegation s of inaccuracy is his own conclusory annotations on \nhis credit report. ( Id.; Dispute Letter, Dkt. 23 -3, at 1 8–20, 30 –31; see also  Dkt. 26 -1, at 13 –27).  Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 7 of 108 \n 6). It is reasonable for Experian to rely on the credit furnishers  to provide accurate information on \nwhether Gray  paid his bill and whether he paid it on time. See Toliver v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 973 F. \nSupp. 2d 707, 727–28 (S.D. Tex. 2013) (finding Experian’s reliance on the credit furnisher for the \n“date of status” entry reasonable  at the summary judgment stage).  Thus, Experian is entitled to \nsummary judgment on this element.  \nC. Injury and Damages  \nThe third and fourth elements of Gray’s claim are that Gray  must prove that he suffered \ninjury; and that this injury  was caused by Experian’s inclusion of inaccurate reporting. Gray argues \nthat he was suffered harm because he was denied a credit card with American Express on November 14, 2022. (Resp., Dkt. 26, at 4; Compl., Dkt. 1, ¶ 6). However, despite Experian asking Gray throughout this litigation for proof of the credit card denial, Gray has  still not produced it . \n(Mot., Dkt. 23, at 11; Reply, Dkt. 27, at 3). Gray asserts that his inability to produce the denial letter is “a result of procedural delays and does not negate the exis tence of harm caused by Experian’s \nreporting” and that he “can and will” present this letter at trial. (Resp., Dkt. 26, at 4).  \nHowever, as the non- moving party, it is Gray’s burden to affirmatively produce this evidence \nat this stage of the litigation to prove that there is a genuine dispute as to his damages. Matsushita , \n475 U.S. at  585– 87. The Court cannot simply accept his word that such a denial letter exists. Indeed, \nExperian convincingly argues that the evidence that does exist suggests that there never was a denial because Gray’s credit report —dated just a little over a year after the purported denial —lists zero \nhard inquiri es evidencing such a denial. (Reply, Dkt. 27, at 3; Ex. 2, Dkt. 23- 2). Further, even \nassuming that American Express did deny Gray a credit card based on his credit report, there is no evidence that it did so based on the negative reporting that Gray disputes . Gray has utilized 90% of \nhis available credit and has over eight credit cards and more than seven secured loans. (Ex. 2, Dkt. 23-2, at 1–2, 4–16). Any one of these factors, or all of them combined, could support a decision to Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 8 of 109 \n deny Gray a credit card. Thus, Experian is entitled to summary judgment on the third and fourth \nelements of the FCRA claim.  \nD. Willfulness  \n Last, Gray alleges that Experian’s inaccurate reporting was not merely negligent but willful. \n(Resp., Dkt. 26, at 5). His allegation rests on the notion that Experian failed to correct alleged \ninaccuracies despite multiple notifications and disputes. ( Id.). Because the Court has found that there \nis insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Gray’s credit report contained any inaccurate information and that Experian acted reasonably in investigating Gray’s disputes, Experian is entitled to summary judgment o n Gray’s all egation of willful violation of the FCRA.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nGray’s FCRA claim rests on four elements, all of which are essential to him prevailing in this \nsuit. See Bacharach v. Suntrust Mortgage, Inc. , 827 F.3d 432, 435 (5th Cir. 2016). “Where the non- moving \nparty fails to establish the existence of an element essential to that party ’s case, and on which that \nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial, no genuine issue of material fact can exist.” Nichols v. Enterasys Networks, Inc. , 495 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir. 2007). “Parties proceeding pro se are still \nrequired  to provide sufficient facts in support of their claims. Even under the rule of liberal \nconstruction, ‘mere conclusory allegations on a critical issue are insufficient.’” Watkins  v. Experian , \n2014 WL 12879669, at *4 (W.D. Tex. Sept. 8, 2014) , report and recommendation adopted by  2014 WL \n12879668 (W.D. Tex. Oct. 3, 2014). The Court has found that Gray has not produced sufficient evidence to support any of the elements of his FCRA  claim. Accordingly, Experian is entitled to \nsummary judgment.  \nFor these reasons, IT IS ORDERED  that Gray’s response  and affidavit , (Dkt s. 28, 29) are \nSTRUCK  from the docket.   Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 9 of 1010 \n \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that Experian’s motion for summary judgment , (Dkt. 23), \nis GRANTED . \nThe Court will enter final judgment by separate order.  \nSIGNED  on September 16 , 202 4.  \n \n \n \n_____________________________________  \n ROBERT PITMAN  \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \n Case 1:23-cv-00545-RP   Document 33   Filed 09/16/24   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, relating to false financial statements following its 1999 initial public offering. Quintus, initially an artificial intelligence software company, provided eCRM solutions and faced financial restatements leading to dramatically falling stock prices and eventual bankruptcy. The court granted final approval of a $10.1 million settlement to be distributed to affected class members, deeming it fair and reasonable given Quintus’s limited financial resources stemming from ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether the settlement agreement in the securities fraud class action involving overstated revenue and misleading financial statements is fair, reasonable, and adequate to compensate the affected investors.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the proposed class action settlement of $10.1 million is fair, reasonable, and adequate, granting final approval for the settlement, the plan of allocation, and the application for attorney fees and expenses.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if a toy company sold shares to people saying it was making more money than it actually was. People bought those shares thinking the company was doing well, but later found out it wasn’t. The company asked all those who bought shares to agree to settle their claims for a shared amount of money because the company went bankrupt. The judge said, \"The deal is fair, so you all split the settlement money based on how much you lost.\" In this case, the company also worked with AI software, which was part of its business before things went wrong.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04276-VRW   Document 21   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation, stemming from the allegation that the company overstated its revenues, leading to an artificially inflated stock price followed by a drastic loss. Quintus, originally focused on artificial intelligence software and later on eCRM solutions, particularly through its product \"eContact\", faced bankruptcy amidst these allegations. The court granted final approval to a $10.1 million settlement to be distributed among affected shareholders, along with attorney fees and expenses, concluding the proceedings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class settlement for securities fraud allegations against Quintus Corporation was fair, reasonable, and adequate, warranting final court approval.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the settlement agreement, noting that it was fair, reasonable, and adequate, particularly given the complexities and risks of further litigation, the company's bankruptcy status, and the absence of any objections from class members.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company got in trouble because they told investors they made more money than they actually did, making their stock look more valuable than it really was. When the truth came out, the stock's price crashed. People who lost money sued the company, and now the court has agreed on a deal where the company pays some money back to those investors. The judge thinks this deal is fair because it's hard to keep asking for money from a company that's also dealing with bankruptcy, and nobody seemed unhappy with this solution.",

For the reasons discussed below, finalapproval of the class settlement and plan of allocation is GRANTEDand the application for award of attorney fees and reimbursement ofexpenses is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 1 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2I\nWhen Quintus was incorporated in 1984, its business was\nartificial intelligence software.  During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04504-VRW   Document 20   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. Summary: In Odish v. Peregrine Semiconductor, Plaintiff Joseph Odish, representing himself and his company, claimed an ownership interest in Cognitive Code, a tech company that developed SILVIA, an AI program competing with Apple's Siri. The Plaintiffs alleged that Defendants, associated with the company as investors and advisors, had diminished SILVIA's value through wrongful conduct. The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction, which the court granted, dismissing the case.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: The primary legal issue was whether the court had personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, who were primarily based in California, in relation to the claims brought by Michigan-based Plaintiffs.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that the Defendants' lack of sufficient ties to Michigan meant the court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. As such, the Defendants' motion to dismiss was granted without addressing the substance of the Plaintiffs' claims.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: The case was about a tech lawyer in Michigan who claimed a stake in a company that made an AI similar to Apple's Siri. He sued some California investors he felt were unfairly lowering the value of this AI. However, because the California folks didn’t have enough connection to Michigan, the court in Michigan couldn’t make them defend themselves in that state, so the judge threw out the case before even looking at whether the claims about the AI were true.",

Cognitiv e Code developed the software program \nSILVIA, an artificial intelligence  product alleged to be a competitor with Apple’s SIRI. Plaintiffs \nsay that they invested time and money in Cogn itive Code to make it more valuable, but that \nDefendants, investors and advisors  for the company, have diminished its value and that of the \nSILVIA program through their allegedly wrongful conduct. \nOn June 25, 2014, Defendants filed a Motion to  Dismiss pursuant to Federal Rules of \nProcedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(3).

(Dkt s. 37, 38, 42.) On November 17, 2014, Magistrate \nJudge Paul J. Komives issued a Report and R ecommendation that Defendants’ motion be granted \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civi l Procedure 12(b)(2). (Dkt. 50.) Pl aintiffs filed objections (Dkt. \n52) and Defendants responded (Dkt. 53). \nThe Court has reviewed the Report, Plainti ffs’ objections, and Defendants’ response. The \nCourt concludes that most of Plai ntiffs’ objections are waived due to their failure to respond to \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss. And the unwai ved objections do not demand reversal of the \nReport and Recommendation. Thus, the Repor t and Recommendation will be ADOPTED and \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Fede ral Rule of Civil Pro cedure 12(b)(2) will be \nGRANTED. \nI. BACKGROUND \nIn their Motion, Defendants argued that this  Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them \nand that venue is improper in th is Court. (Defs.’ Br. at 1–2.) They also ask that this case be \ntransferred to the United States District Court for the Northern Di strict of California pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). ( Id.) The relevant allegations regarding the Defendants, as stated in the \nAmended Complaint, are as follows: \nDefendant Gary Morgenthaler is a reside nt of California and a principal equity \npartner of Morgenthaler Ventures. \nDefendant PEREGRINE SEMICONDUCTOR  SYSTEMS. A publicly traded \ncompany with ticker symbol PMSI that Gary Morgenthaler s till has a significant \nequity interest and exercises “cont rol” over per SEC regulations and \ndefinitions. . . . \nDefendant Gaye Melissa Morgenthaler is  a resident [of] California and upon \ninformation and belief, a significant stakeh older in the private venture capital firm \nthat bears her name. She and her husba nd Defendant David Jones are presently \nmembers of the Advisory Board of Cognitive Code per the corporation \nwebsite. . . . 2:13-cv-14026-LJM-APP   Doc # 54   Filed 03/11/15   Pg 2 of 10    Pg ID <pageID> \n3 \n Defendant David Jones is a resident of California and married to Defendant Gaye \nMelissa Morgenthaler. \nDefendant Morgenthaler Vent ures is a Delaware Corpor ation that specializes in \nVenture Capital funding. . . . [with] their main office in Menlo Park, California. \nAnd other offices in Cleveland, Ohio, wher e the subsidiary Morgenthaler Private \nEquity Group is housed. They also have offices in Boston. . . . \n(Dkt. 14, Am. Compl., at ¶¶ 15–20.) \nAs to jurisdiction and venue, the Ame nded Complaint states as follows:  \nThe jurisdiction of this Court is based upon § 22 of the Securi ties Act of 1933, 15 \nU.S.C. § 77v, Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and principles of supplemental \njurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1367. Ve nue is proper in this district pursuant to § 27 of \nthe Exchange Act and 28 U.S.C § 1391(b). Defendant Peregrine Semiconductor is a publically traded company;  many of the acts herein this district and all the \nnamed Defendants conduct substantial busines s in this District. Securities Subject \nMatter jurisdiction: This action also arises under §§ 10(b ) and 20(a) of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “ 1934 Act”), 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j( b) and 78t, \nand the rules and regulations promulgate d thereunder, includi ng SEC Rule 10b-5, \n17 C.F.R. 240.10b-5. Jurisdiction is based upon Section 27 of  the 1934 Act, 15 \nU.S.C. § 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. § 1331. Venue is thus also proper in this District \nunder section 27 of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa, and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b). Defendants maintained its United States o ffices, transacts business, and has agents \nin this District. Further, th e wrongs alleged herein occurr ed in substantial part in \nthis District. That wrongful conduct in cluded the preparation of false and \nmisleading information in this District  and the dissemination of that false \ninformation to the investing public from this District. \n (i) Additionally Venue in district in  which codefendant effected important \npart of swindle is proper venue for defendant even if  the defendant has had no \ncontacts with that district. Hill v. Turner (1980, MD Pa ) 492 F. Supp. 61, CCH \nFed Secur L Rep P 97643. While all defendant s have and continue to have contact \nwith this district and Peregrine, as stat ed above, is a publicly traded company, Mr. \nGary Morgenthaler is  the key principle. \n (ii) Gary Morgenthaler is the defe ndant that “effected the swindle” and \nperpetrated the fraud upon Plaintiffs, knowing full well of their stock and \ncontractual rights. \n(iii) Moreover, Gary Morgenthaler, as established below per SEC \ndefinition “exercises control” over Morgenthaler Ventures and other entities, including a Morgenthaler-back ed entity that just went  public in summer of 2013 2:13-cv-14026-LJM-APP   Doc # 54   Filed 03/11/15   Pg 3 of 10    Pg ID <pageID> \n4 \n and has a Technology Colloboration with th e University of Michigan. The name \nof the company is ONCOMED and may be ju st as tainted as [] the other entities. \n(iv) Venue is proper under 1391(b) in this district because the fraudulent \nscheme was in large part carried out by the use of instrumentalities of commerce \nand mails to effectuate the fraud and the illegal and unlawful misconduct which \nremains ongoing. \n(v) UNDER CO-CONSPIRACY THEO RY OF VENUE, it is not \nnecessary that each named defendant have  engaged in transactions in Forum \ndistrict and act of single de fendant is therefore deemed to  be act of all defendants, \nestablishing venue as to all Defendants in that District; theref ore, venue is proper \nwhere important steps in the execu tion and consummation of the fraudulent \nscheme. \n(Am. Compl. at ¶ 59.)  \nDefendants filed their Motion to Dismiss pursu ant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n12(b)(2) and (b)(3) on June 25, 20 14. (Dkt. 36.) Plaintiffs did not  respond. Instead, they  filed \nthree requests for judicial notice of facts rega rding Oncomed Pharmaceuticals (Dkts. 37–39) and \na request for judicial notice of “ongoing fraudul ent activity” (Dkt. 48). None of these filings \naddressed the arguments in Defendants’ Motion to  Dismiss. Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for \nLeave to Amend the Complaint. (Dkt. 43.) Both the Motion to Dismiss and the Motion for Leave \nto Amend the Complaint were referred to Magist rate Judge Komives. He  denied the Motion for \nLeave to Amend on November 17, 2014. (Dkt. 49.) He entered his Report and Recommendation \nto Grant Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss on the same day. (Dkt. 50.)  Plaintiffs filed objections \n(Dkt. 52) and Defendant s responded (Dkt. 53). \nThe Magistrate Judge recommends that this Court grant Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. In his Report, he  first noted that the motion could be granted as \nunopposed due to Plaintiffs’ failure to respond. (Report at 4 n.2.) But he still addressed the \nsubstance of Defendants’ arguments. He conclude d that Plaintiffs coul d not establish general \njurisdiction with respect to the individual defendants under any relevant section of the Michigan 2:13-cv-14026-LJM-APP   Doc # 54   Filed 03/11/15   Pg 4 of 10    Pg ID <pageID> \n5 \n long-arm statute, Michigan Compiled Laws § 600.701. (Report at 6–7.) He determined the same \nwith respect to the corporate defendants, referring to Michigan Compiled Laws § 600.711. \n(Report at 7.) Next, he concluded that Plainti ffs could not establish sp ecific jurisdiction with \nrespect to either the individual or the corporat e defendants pursuant to Michigan Compiled Laws \n§ 600.705. Plaintiffs have raised si x objections to the Report. ( See Dkt. 52, Obj.) \nII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThis Court reviews the Magistrate Judge’s  Report and Recommend ation pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b). U nder this rule, the C ourt performs a de novo  review of \nthose portions of the Report and Recommendati on that were met with timely and “specific” \nobjections by the parties. Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3 ). The Court need not and does not perform a de \nnovo review of the report’s  unobjected-to findings. Thomas v. Arn , 474 U.S. 140, 150 (1985); \nGarrison v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC , No. 10-cv-13990, 2012 WL 1278044, at *8 (E.D. Mich. \nApr. 16, 2012) (“The Court is no t obligated to review the porti ons of the report to which no \nobjection was made.” (citing Arn, 474 U.S. at 149–52)). \nThe Sixth Circuit has noted that “while the Ma gistrate Judge Act, 28 U.S.C. § 631 et seq. , \npermits de novo  review by the district court if timel y objections are filed, absent compelling \nreasons, it does not allow parties to raise at the district court stage new arguments or issues that \nwere not presented to the magistrate.” Murr v. United States , 200 F.3d 895, 902 n.1 (6th Cir. \n2000). That is to say, “issues raised for the first ti me in objections to [a] magistrate judge’s report \nand recommendation are deemed waived.” Id. (citing Marshall v. Chater , 75 F.3d 1421, 1426–27 \n(10th Cir. 1996)). This is so because “[t]he Magi strates Act was not intende d to give litigants an \nopportunity to run one version of their case past the magistrate, then anot her past the district \ncourt.” Jones-Bey v. Caruso , No. 1:07-CV-3921:07-CV-3, 2009 WL 3644801, at *1 (W.D. 2:13-cv-14026-LJM-APP   Doc # 54   Filed 03/11/15   Pg 5 of 10    Pg ID <pageID> \n6 \n Mich. Oct. 30, 2009) (quoting Greenhow v. United States , 863 F.2d 633, 638–39 (9th Cir. 1988), \nrev’d on other grounds sub. nom United States v. Hardesty , 977 F.3d 1347 (9th Cir. 1992) (en \nbanc)); see also Mitchell v. Cnty. of Washtenaw , No. 06-13160, 2009 WL 909581, at *4 (E.D. \nMich. Mar. 31, 2009) (citing cases to demonstrat e that “Courts generally will not consider \narguments on review that were not rais ed before the magistrate judge.”). \nMoreover, objections to a magistrate’s report should “explain[] and cite[] specific \nportions of the report which [c ounsel] deem[s] problematic.” Robert v. Tesson , 507 F.3d 981, \n994 (6th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted). Indeed, a general objection to the entirety of a report \ncreates a scenario in which “[t]he  functions of the dist rict court are effectiv ely duplicated as both \nthe magistrate and the district court perform identical tasks.” Howard v. Sec’y of Health & \nHuman Servs. , 932 F.2d 505, 509 (6th Cir. 1991); see also Mira v. Marshall , 806 F.2d 636, 637 \n(6th Cir. 1986) (“The parties have the duty to pi npoint those portions of th e magistrate’s report \nthat the district court must specially consider.”).  \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nPlaintiffs’ first objection is th at the Report “ignores  significant portions of the complaint, \nthe 123 Exhibits submitted in support of the Compla int, as well as Requests for Judicial Notices \nand the Exhibits submitted in support of those Requests.” (Obj . at 2.) But Plaintiffs do not \nspecify those portions of the Amended Complain t, Exhibits, and Requests for Judicial Notice \nthat the Report failed to address. Nor do they  specify why these unident ified portions render the \nReport erroneous. This general stat ement is not a proper objecti on and it is not entitled to de \nnovo review. See Robert , 507 F.3d at 994; Howard , 932 F.2d at 509; Mira , 806 F.2d at 637. \nIn their second objection, Plaintiffs argue that Defendant Gary Morganthaler “is a \ndirector of Nuance, a [M]organthaler-[V]entures backed publicly traded entity.” (Obj. at 2.) 2:13-cv-14026-LJM-APP   Doc # 54   Filed 03/11/15   Pg 6 of 10    Pg ID <pageID> \n7 \n Plaintiffs argue that Nuance has “systematic and continuous contacts” with this forum because it \n“sells a product called ‘Dragon Dictation’ ” in “every district in America.” ( Id.) Thus, Plaintiffs \nsay that at minimum, the Court has personal ju risdiction over Defendant Gary Morganthaler—as \nan agent of Nuance. ( Id.) But Plaintiffs never presented this  argument to the Magistrate Judge. \nIndeed, Nuance is mentioned only in passing in the allegations of the Amended Complaint, as an \nexample of the investments made by Morganthaler Ventures. ( See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 20, 71.) Thus, \nthis objection is deemed waived and will not be considered. See Murr , 200 F.3d at 902 n.1; \nJones-Bey , 2009 WL 3644801, at *1. \nIn their third objection, Plaintiffs say that the Report incorporates the premise that \n“Morganthaler Ventures is a mere association and not a legal entity,” which would “legally \nnegate the applicability of the Civil Rico Statute in matte rs such as this, 18 U.S.C.S. §§ 1961 et \nseq.” (Obj. at 3.) There was no briefing on the a pplicability—or relevance—of the Racketeer \nInfluenced and Corrupt Organiza tions Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1962 (“RI CO”), before the Magistrate \nJudge. The objection is therefore wa ived. And if Plaintiffs are pr otesting the terminology used in \nthe Report, the Magistrate Judge explicitly stat ed that the term “Morganthaler Ventures” was \nused only for the sake of clarity. (Report at 8 n.5; see also  Dkt. 36-5, Walters Decl., at ¶ 3 \n(“Morganthaler Ventures” is not itself a lega l entity, it is a trade name encompassing the \n“Morganthaler Management Corporation . . . si x private investment funds that are limited \npartnerships . . . and related limited liability company entitie s (LLCs) that support and/or \ncoinvest in the Fund.”).) \nIn their fourth objection, Plaint iffs argue that the Report ignore s their requests for judicial \nnotice regarding the Defendants’ relationship to Oncomed Pharm aceuticals, Inc. (Obj. at 3.) \nEven construing Plaintiffs’ requests for judicial no tice as a response to the motion to dismiss, this 2:13-cv-14026-LJM-APP   Doc # 54   Filed 03/11/15   Pg 7 of 10    Pg ID <pageID> \n8 \n argument does not persuade. Oncomed is alle ged to be “a Morganthaler-backed entity \nthat . . . has a Technology Collaboration with the University of Michigan.” (Am. Compl. at ¶ \n59(iii).) Plaintiffs also allege that Gary Morganthaler “exercises control” over Oncomed. ( Id. at \n¶¶ 59(iii); 292.) Whether Oncomed is incorporated in Michigan  or merely conducts some \nbusiness here is unclear from the allegations of the Amended Complaint, but Securities and \nExchange Commission data attached to one of Pl aintiffs’ requests for judi cial notice state that \nOncomed is a Delaware corporation with  a business address in California. ( See Dkt. 37-2, \nEDGAR Search Results, at 1.) Th e Court finds that Oncomed’s re lationship with the University \nof Michigan is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction ov er the Defendants.  \nTo the extent that Plaintiffs argue that invest ing in a company located in this district is \nenough to subject Defendants to personal jurisd iction, “a company does not purposefully avail \nitself merely by owning all or some of a corporation subject to jurisdiction.” Dean v. Motel 6 \nOperating L.P. , 134 F.3d 1269, 1274 (6th Cir. 1998) (citing cases). Rather, Plaintiffs must \n“provide sufficient evidence” to allow the court to  conclude that they are “being brought into \ncourt for something [they] have done, not for something [Oncomed] has done.” Id. Plaintiffs’ \nvague allegations that Oncomed is “likely to [b e] part of the conspira cy” (Am. Compl. ¶ 37) \nalleged in this case do not suffice.  \nTo the extent that Plaintiffs argue that Oncomed is a subsidiary of Morganthaler \nVentures, “[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a parent  company does not arise merely because the \nforum state properly asserts jurisd iction over one of its subsidiaries . The analysis must focus on \nwhat the parent corporation ha s done, not its subsidiary.” Lafarge Corp. v. Altech Env’t, U.S.A. , \n220 F. Supp. 2d 823, 827 (E.D. Mich. 2002) (citing Dean , 134 F.3d at 1273–74). And further, \n“unless the plaintiff clearly s hows otherwise, the Court will presume that companies holding 2:13-cv-14026-LJM-APP   Doc # 54   Filed 03/11/15   Pg 8 of 10    Pg ID <pageID> \n9 \n themselves out as parent and subsidiary are in fact separate entities.” Id. There are no allegations \nregarding Oncomed and any Morganthaler-related  enterprise that would allow the Court to \novercome this presumption. Nor do Plaintiffs’ re quests for judicial notice demand a different \nconclusion. Far from showing that Peregrine Semi conductor, Inc., “Morganthaler Ventures,” or \nany other individual defendant is  not separate from Oncomed, the requests merely incorporate \nbackground information on Oncomed itself. Thus, Plaintiffs’ fourth objection is overruled.  \nIn their fifth objection, Plainti ffs protest the denial of their request for leave to amend the \nComplaint. (Obj. at 3–4.) This denial was not part of the Re port and Recommendation, but rather \nwas issued as a separate, contemporaneous order.  (Dkt. 49.) Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 72(a), a party has 14 days in which to serve and file objections to a magistrate judge’s \ndisposition of a “pretrial matter not dispositive of  a party’s claim or defe nse.” While Plaintiffs \nreceived a stipulation to exte nd the deadline for objections to the Report and Recommendation, \nthey did not ask for an extensi on for the deadline for objections  to the Order Denying Leave to \nFile an Amended Complaint. ( See Dkt. 51.) This objection, filed mo re than 14 days after entry of \nthe order, is untimely and will not be considered. \nIn their sixth and final objecti on, Plaintiffs argue that the Report “fail[s] to consider \napplicability of Section 27 of Securities Act 1934 [15 U.S.C. § 78aa] allowing for nationwide \nservice of process, in conjuncti on with Michigan’s long arm stat ute.” (Obj. at 4.) This argument \nwas not presented to the Magistrate Judge and it is  therefore waived. It w ill not be addressed for \nthe first time on review. 2:13-cv-14026-LJM-APP   Doc # 54   Filed 03/11/15   Pg 9 of 10    Pg ID <pageID> \n10 \n IV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case arises from a consolidated securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation, an AI software company that allegedly overstated its revenue, leading to significant financial discrepancies. The court granted final approval for a settlement of $10.1 million due to the inability to locate deeper financial resources from the bankrupt corporation, and also approved attorney fees and expenses amounting to $1,141,978.40. The AI aspect is highlighted through Quintus's business focus on artificial intelligence, particularly its \"eCRM\" solutions during the time in question.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement of $10.1 million for the securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the plaintiffs, given the circumstances of bankruptcy and overstated revenue by the company.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate, granting final approval for both the settlement and the allocation plan. Additionally, the court approved the requested attorney fees and expenses, finding them reasonable in relation to the services provided.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a technology company made people believe it was making more money than it actually was. When everyone found out, the company's stock price crashed. People who bought shares during that time felt cheated and took the company to court. The company was out of money, but it agreed to pay back some of the money to the people who lost out, totaling $10.1 million. The court said this was a fair deal, considering the company had declared bankruptcy, and allowed the lawyers to get paid for their work without any objections from the people involved.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04274-VRW   Document 18   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.

Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, which provided eCustomer Relationship Management solutions. After an audit revealed financial misstatements, the company's stock plummeted, leading to its bankruptcy and subsequent class-action lawsuits by investors. The case was settled with a $10.1 million fund for affected shareholders, and the plan of allocation and attorney fees were approved by the court. Notably, Quintus initially focused on artificial intelligence software before transitioning to CRM solutions, but the fraud case itself does not hinge on AI technologies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement for the securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and whether the plan of allocation and attorney fees and expenses should be approved.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the proposed class action settlement, plan of allocation, and the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses, finding them fair, reasonable, and adequate in light of the complex litigation and Quintus's bankruptcy.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you bought a toy and the company said it was super cool and safe, but then it broke very easily and wasn't safe at all. A bunch of people who also got the toy got together to say, \"Hey, you tricked us!\" They all went to court, and eventually, the toy company said, \"Okay, we'll pay you some money to make up for it.\" The judge checked if what the company was offering was good enough and fair to everyone who got tricked. The judge decided it was fair and said, \"Yep, let's go with this plan to give back money to the people who bought the toy.\"",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04390-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04390-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04390-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04390-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04390-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04390-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04390-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).

In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.

A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.

Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:01-cv-00262-VRW   Document 17   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a consolidated securities fraud class action related to the Quintus Corporation. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of purchasers of Quintus common stock, asserting that the company made false financial statements. The court approved a settlement of $10.1 million, along with a plan of allocation, concluding that the settlement was fair and reasonable. AI technologies are tangentially related, as Quintus was initially involved in AI software before transitioning to \"eCRM\" solutions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Did the defendants engage in securities fraud by making false and misleading statements about Quintus Corporation's financial status, thereby violating federal securities laws?\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the class settlement and the plan of allocation, finding the settlement to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. The court also approved the requested attorney fees and expenses, as they were deemed reasonable for the value provided to the class.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company that sold stock to people, but later it turned out they weren’t honest about how well the company was doing financially. Many people who bought the stock lost money when the truth came out. They came together to sue, and eventually, the company agreed to pay some money back to these people. The judge reviewed this payback plan and said it was fair, so everyone who lost money will get a share of the settlement money.",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   The case involves a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, which inflated its revenues in financial statements. After declaring bankruptcy, Quintus faced numerous lawsuits which were consolidated into a class action. A settlement agreement involved Quintus paying $10.1 million to affected shareholders, and the court approved this settlement along with the allocation plan and attorney fees. The case highlights that Quintus was initially involved in artificial intelligence software focusing on \"e-Customer Relationship Management\" solutions during the relevant class period.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether the proposed class action settlement, including the allocation plan and attorney fees, is fair, reasonable, and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e).\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court granted final approval of the class action settlement, deciding that the settlement amount of $10.1 million, the allocation plan, and the requested attorney fees and expenses were fair, reasonable, and adequate. The settlement was deemed beneficial due to the risks, costs, and complexities of further litigation in light of Quintus's bankruptcy status.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine a company that makes software to help businesses manage customer relationships. The company told everyone they were making a lot of money, so people bought lots of their stock. But later, it turned out they were not making as much money as they claimed. Their stock price crashed, and they went bankrupt. Lots of folks who bought the stock were upset and said the company tricked them. They all got together and filed a big lawsuit to get their money back. The company agreed to pay $10.1 million to settle the fight. The court liked this plan and agreed with the lawyers, who worked hard on the case, to get paid for their efforts.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04678-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04678-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04678-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985.

MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04678-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case is a consolidated securities fraud class action concerning Quintus Corporation, which went bankrupt after being publicly traded for one year. The plaintiffs alleged that Quintus overstated its financial condition in various statements and reports, leading to financial losses when the true conditions emerged. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement as well as reimbursement for attorney fees and expenses, noting the settlement's fairness given Quintus's limited resources due to bankruptcy.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement of the securities fraud class action is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class members who purchased Quintus stock.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the class action settlement and the plan of allocation, finding that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. It also approved the requested attorney fees and expenses.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you bought stock in a company that said it was making lots of money, but later you find out they weren't telling the truth and the company went bankrupt. A lot of people who bought stock with you got together to sue the company for misleading them. They agreed on a way to settle and get some money back, even if it wasn't all the money they lost. The judge checked the deal to make sure it was fair and decided that it was a good way to handle the situation, allowing the settlement to go through and approving the lawyers' payment.",

Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:01-cv-00093-VRW   Document 9   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This is a consolidated securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation, which involved claims of misrepresentation in its financial statements leading up to bankruptcy. The case reached a settlement where Quintus agreed to pay $10.1 million, which the court approved along with the allocation plan and the request for attorney fees. The case involved Quintus using artificial intelligence and eCRM software, which was part of its business operations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed settlement of $10.1 million and the plan of allocation for the securities fraud class action lawsuit are fair, reasonable, and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the $10.1 million settlement, ruling it to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. It also approved the proposed plan of allocation and the request for attorney fees and expenses.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company called Quintus which sold software that helps manage customer relationships. Some years ago, Quintus said it was making a lot of money but later people found out they weren't telling the truth, and the company went bankrupt. People who bought Quintus stock felt cheated, so they sued. After a long court process, everyone agreed that Quintus would pay back some money. The judge decided that the agreement was fair and allowed it. They also decided how to divide the money among those who were tricked and how much lawyers would get paid for their work.",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation, accused of making false statements related to its financial status. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of individuals who purchased Quintus stock between November 15, 1999, and November 15, 2000. During this period, Quintus was involved in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and e-Customer Relationship Management (eCRM) software. The parties reached a $10.1 million settlement, which was approved by the court. \n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue in this case was whether Quintus Corporation committed securities fraud by overstating its revenue and providing misleading information in its financial statements, affecting investor decisions during its initial public offering (IPO).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the final settlement of $10.1 million for the class of affected shareholders and granted the application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses. The court found the settlement fair, reasonable, and adequate considering the complex litigation, the company's bankruptcy, and the allocation of limited resources to multiple litigants.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine buying a toy from a company because they said it was super popular and everyone loved it. Later, you find out the company lied about how many toys they actually sold. This case is like a group of people who bought that toy getting together to take the company to court for lying. The judge in this case said, \"Okay, the company needs to pay back some of the money to the people who bought the toy,\" and everyone agreed to the amount they would receive back. In this case, the company's toy was a kind of computer software, and the legal stuff was about what they should have told people who bought parts of their company (like the toy).",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04381-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04381-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04381-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This is a United States District Court case regarding a securities fraud class action involving Quintus Corporation, a company that provided AI-powered eCRM solutions. The case dealt with allegations of false and misleading statements in registration statements and financial reports related to Quintus's IPO and subsequent acquisition, leading to significant financial losses for shareholders. The court approved a $10.1 million settlement for class members, alongside attorney fees and expenses, ensuring fair distribution based on the degree of loss each suffered.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The main legal issue involved whether false financial statements by Quintus constituted securities fraud, violating sections of the Securities Act of 1933 and Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which led to significant shareholder losses.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted the final approval of the proposed $10.1 million settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate for the class members, and approved the allocation plan and attorney fees, citing the challenges and risks of further litigation and the successful negotiation achieved despite the company's bankruptcy.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine a company that uses technology to help other companies manage their customer relationships tells everyone that their finances are great, encouraging people to invest by buying stocks. Turns out, they weren't truthful about their finances, and when the real numbers were revealed, the company's stock price crashed, and it went bankrupt. People who lost money sued, and the court approved a plan where the company pays $10.1 million to those who bought stocks during this time, while also covering the lawyers' fees, saying this was the best solution given the tough situation and the company's financial problems.",

For the reasons discussed below, finalapproval of the class settlement and plan of allocation is GRANTEDand the application for award of attorney fees and reimbursement ofexpenses is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 1 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2I\nWhen Quintus was incorporated in 1984, its business was\nartificial intelligence software.  During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.  Quintus , 148 F Supp 2d at 985. Case 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 5 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n6This proposed settlement’s settlement/potential investor loss (PIL)\nratio of 16.83% marginally exceeds the average class actionsecurities litigation settlement/PIL ratio of 16.66%.  MukeshBajaj, Sumon C Mazumdar & Atuya Sarin, Securities Class Action\nSettlements , 43 Santa Clara L Rev 101, 116 tbl 11 (2003). \nAchieving the average settlement/PIL ratio despite having tocompete with Quintus’s bankruptcy estate for remaining resourcesindicates the fairness of this settlement to class members.\nFollowing the hearing, plaintiffs’ counsel expressed\nconcern that courts’ use of studies to predict recovery at theoutset of litigation may tend to cap recovery at that level.  Whilethe court does not discount that concern, it warrants mention thatthe Haas study data reflect a range of litigation results.  Anyindividual case may differ and differ significantly from theaverage or median results.  In any event, the obstacles to agreater recovery in this case were substantial.  Given thosedifficulties, a recovery within the average range may wellrepresent an achievement that is greater than average.  \nFinally, the absence of any objections or requests for\nexclusion among a class of this size demonstrates the overallreasonableness of this settlement.  \nThe risk and cost of further litigation, the settlement\namount and the silence of class members provide powerful evidencethat the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate.  Accordingly,plaintiffs’ motion for final approval of the class actionsettlement is GRANTED.////Case 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 6 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n7III\nPlaintiffs also seek final approval of the plan of\nallocation of the settlement fund.  Doc #274.  The plan ofallocation operates as follows: \nTo the extent there are sufficient funds in the Net\nSettlement Fund, each Authorized Claimant will receive anamount equal to the Authorized Claimant’s claim.  If,however, the amount in the Net Settlement Fund is notsufficient to permit payment of the total claim of eachAuthorized Claimant, then each Authorized Claimant shallbe paid the percentage that each Authorized Claimant’sclaim bears to the total of the claims of all AuthorizedClaimants.  A claim will be computed as follows: theclaim shall be equal to the amount paid for shares ofQuintus common stock purchased or acquired by SettlementClass members during the Settlement Class Period, less:(a) the amount realized from the sale of any such sharesduring the Settlement Class Period or through February22, 2001, or $0.14 per share, whichever is greater; or(b) the number of any such shares held at the close ofbusiness on February 22, 2001, multiplied by $0.14 (theclosing price of Quintus stock on February 22, 2001).\nDoc #277 Ex A at 10.  The plan of allocation was fully described innotice letters to potential class members and no objections weresubmitted to the court or raised at the hearing.\nThe court has discretion to approve a plan of allocation\nthat is fair and reasonable.  In re Heritage Bond Litigation\n, 2005\nUS Dist LEXIS 13555 at *38 (CD Cal 2005).  “A plan of allocationthat reimburses class members based on the extent of their injuriesis generally reasonable.”  Id (quoting In re Oracle Securities\nLitigation , 1994 US Dist LEXIS 21593 at *1 (ND Cal 1994)).  Because this plan provides proportional reimbursement and\nno class member objected, the court concludes the plan ofallocation is fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the motion forfinal approval of the plan of allocation is GRANTED.Case 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 7 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n8IV\nLead plaintiff and his counsel seek an award of attorney\nfees and expenses totaling $1,141,978.40.  Doc #275 at 16.  Thisamount includes attorney fees of $817,500, expenses of $150,000,reimbursement of fees and expenses of bankruptcy counsel of$162,478.40 and reimbursement of $12,000 to the lead plaintiff. Id.  The fees and expenses sought amount to 11.3% of the totalsettlement amount.\nThe court preliminarily approved an award of attorney\nfees and expenses in its July 7, 2006, order.  Doc #269 at 21. This request differs by including $15,096.40 of additional fees andexpenses of bankruptcy counsel and $12,000 in reimbursement to leadplaintiff.  The court anticipated such an increase in the amountsought for bankruptcy counsel.  Id.  Lead plaintiff, however, seeksreimbursement for 80 hours of his time at a rate of $150/hour forthe first time.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶¶2-3.  The court is authorizedto reimburse lead plaintiff for reasonable costs and expensesrelated to the representation of the class, including lost wages. 15 USC §78u-4(a)(4).  As a registered securities principal and theprincipal of RAMA Financial, lead plaintiff’s request forcompensation is reasonable.  Doc #276 Ex 5 at ¶3.\nThese minor increases in the amount requested do not\ndisturb the court’s prior conclusion that “the amount of attorneyfees (including those incurred by bankruptcy counsel) is relativelymodest in relation to the total class recovery.”  Doc #269 at 21. This court, however, “rejects reliance solely on a comparison ofthe percentage fee requested here with other percentage awards orwith a so-called benchmark percentage.”  In re HPL Technologies,Case 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 8 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n9Inc Sec Litig , 366 F Supp 2d 912, 914 (ND Cal 2005).  Instead, the\ncourt employs a lodestar cross-check to determine thereasonableness of the requested attorney fees.\n“Three figures are salient in a lodestar calculation: (1)\ncounsel’s reasonable hours, (2) counsel’s reasonable hourly rateand (3) a multiplier thought to compensate for various factors.” Id at 919.  In performing a cross-check, the court calculates theimplied multiplier to determine its reasonableness.  Lead counselhas spent more than 5,000 attorney hours in this matter, most ofthem by senior attorneys.  Doc #275 Ex 1.  Applying the Laffey\nmatrix hourly rates, as adjusted for Los Angeles and cost of livingincreases, lead counsel calculates its lodestar as $1,976,262.50. Id at 12 and Ex 1.  The requested attorney fees of $817,500, lessthan half the lodestar, provide an implied lodestar multiplier of0.414.  Id at 13.  This multiplier is indeed reasonable, indicatingclass members obtained a significant discount on market attorneyrates.  Notably, competitive selection of class counsel producedthis low loadstar ratio or negative multiplier.  Quintus\n, 148 F\nSupp 2d 967.  Despite any statutory limitation on use ofcompetitive selection, see In re Cavanaugh\n, 306 F3d 726 (9th Cir\n2002), this provides further evidence that courts may look to thecompetitive selection cases in determining a reasonable level offees and costs.  See In re Cabletron, Inc Securities Litigation\n,\n2006 US Dist LEXIS 75188 (D NH 2006).\nThe requested attorney fees and expenses are reasonable\ncompensation for the value provided to the class.  This is furtherevidenced by the lack of class member objections to thepreliminarily approved attorney fees and expenses included in theCase 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 9 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n10\nclass notice.\nAccordingly, the application for award of attorney fees\nand reimbursement of expenses is GRANTED.\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n                                   \nVAUGHN R WALKERUnited States District Chief JudgeCase 3:00-cv-04771-VRW   Document 19   Filed 12/05/06   Page 10 of 10",

(Doc. No. 91) The motion is fully briefed and ready for disposition. For the \nfollowing reasons, the motion will be denied in part.  \nBackground  \nThis multidistrict litigation arises from a data security breach  involving \nAshleyMadison.com, a “dating” website that represents itself as a site to facilitate intimate \nrelationships for individuals who are either married or in a committed relationship. Defendant \nAvid Dating Life, Inc. (“Avid”) owns and operates the we bsite. Plaintiffs in these actions allege, \non behalf of similar putative nationwide or state classes, that Avid failed to adequately secure \ntheir personal and financial information; marketed a “Full Delete Removal” service that did not, \nin fact, purge user  account information from the Ashley Madison database; and made extensive \nuse of artificial intelligence “bots” and other mechanisms to mimic fake users (specifically, \nfemale users) on the Ashley Madison website in order to induce actual (predominantly mal e) \nusers to make purchases.  \nFollowing an initial status conference with counsel on January 26, 2015, Plaintiffs were \nordered to file any Motion for Leave to Proceed Under Pseudonyms by February 15, 2016.

( Id.) On the \nparties’ con sent motion, the Court entered the parties’ agreed upon limited protective order on \nFebruary 16, 2016. (Doc. No. 93)  \nThis matter is now before the Court on Plaintiffs’ fully briefed Motion for Leave to \nProceed Under Pseudonyms. (Doc. No. 91) Forty -two Plaintiffs1 seeking to represent a class of \nusers of the Ashley Madison website  have filed under pseudonym “to reduce the risk of \npotentially catastrophic personal and professional consequences that could befall them and their \nfamilies” should they be publicly  identified as someone whose sensitive personal information, \ni.e., names, email addresses, credit card information, and sexual preferences and habits, was \ncontained in Avid’s “cheating website” database. (Doc. No. 91 at ¶ 1; Doc. No. 92 at 1) Avid \nopposes Plaintiffs ’ motion  on the grounds that anonymous lawsuits are not permitted except in \nrare and exceptional circumstances, none of which apply here. (Doc. No. 109 at 3 -11) Avid \nfurther argues it will be significantly prejudiced if Plaintiffs are permitted t o proceed \nanonymously. ( Id. at 12 -14) Lastly, if the forty -two unnamed plaintiffs prefer to remain \nanonymous, they should do so as class members . (Id. at 14 -15) \nLegal standard  \nThe parties do not disagree on the overarching aspects of the law  governing the \ncircumstances under which a plaintiff may proceed under pseudonym .

The \npublic has a First Amendment right to access judicial proceedings, and that right includes the \nidentity of the parties  to litigation . Chambliss v . Liberty Life Assur.

Indeed, w hen a plaintiff commences an action in federal court, \nhe “invites public scrutin y of the dispute and the proceeding.” Id. \nThe decision to allow pseudonyms is within a court’s discretion. W.G.A. v. Priority \nPharmacy, Inc. , 184 F.R.D. 616, 617 (E.D. Mo. 1999). Neither the Eighth Circuit nor the \nSupreme Court has addressed the issue of when a pseudonym may be used ; however, m any \nfederal courts of appeal and numerous district courts have reached this issue . Roe v. St. Louis \nUniversity , No. 4:08 -CV-1474 -JCH, 2009 WL 910738, at *3 (E.D. Mo. Apr. 2, 2009) (citing \ncases). These courts have held  that a totality -of-the-circumstances balancing test must be used \nwhen deciding whether a party can sue under a pseudonym; in other words, the court must \nascertain whether the plaintiff “has a substantial privacy right which outweighs the customary \nconstit utionally -embedded presumption of openness in judicial proceedings.”  Id. (quoting Frank , \n951 F.2d at 323 (internal quotations and citation omitted )). The courts have identified several \nfactors common to cases in which a plaintiff has been permitted to proc eed under a fictitious \nname, including “(1) where the plaintiff is challenging government activity; (2) where the \nplaintiff is required to disclose information of the utmost intimacy; and (3) where the plaintiff \nrisks criminal prosecution through the infor mation contained in the pleading.”  Id. (quoting Doe \nH.M. v. St. Louis County , No. 4:07 -CV-2116 -CEJ, 2008 WL 151629 at *1 (E.D.  Mo. Jan.14, \n2008)  (citing Frank , 951 F.2d at 323 ).

Courts have generally allowed \nplaintiffs to litigate under pseudonym in cases involving allegations of sexual abuse and assault  \nbecause they concern highly sensitive and personal subjects.  See e.g., St. Louis University , 2009 \nWL 910738 (allowing rape victim to use a pseudonym because her privacy interest outweighed \nthe public’s right to access judicial records); Doe v.

(Doc.

( See Doc. Nos. 91 -1, -2, \n-3, -4) \nIn its response, Avid notes that a number of Plaintiffs who have filed similar class a ction \ncomplaints are using their real names,2 which  weakens  the argument Plaintiffs are asserting in \ntheir motion. Avid argues that Plaintiffs’ sexual preferences and habits do not constitute \ninformation of the utmost intimacy so as to require anonymity  and cites several cases  which hold \nthat potential embarrassment and economic harm are not enough to outweigh the public interest \nin open court proceedings.

Moreover, the personal and financial \ninformation Plaintiffs seek to protect has already been r eleased on the internet and made \navailable to the public . (Doc. No. 109 at 6 -7) \nIn further response, Avid argues it will be significantly prejudiced if Plaintiffs are \nallowed to proceed anonymously , both in terms of adverse publicity and its ability to con duct \ndiscovery . (Doc. No. 109 at 12 -14) However, Plaintiffs have disclosed their real names to Avid \npursuant to the parties’ agreed upon limited protective order. A similar limited protective order \ncan be used to protect other sensitive information as the case proceeds. Thus, the Court finds \nAvid’s ability to conduct discovery or mount a defense will not be impa ired. Roe v. Catholic \nHealth Initiatives Colorado , No. 11 -CV-02179 -WYD -KMT, 2012 WL 12840, at *5 (D. Colo. \nJan. 4, 2012).   \nPlaintiffs’ privacy interests are not as pronounced as those in th e cases discussed above . \nNevertheless, the Court finds t he possibl e injury to Plaintiffs rises above the level of mere \nembarrassment or harm to reputation  and weighs against public disclosure. Under the  facts  Case: 4:15-md-02669-JAR   Doc. #:  138   Filed: 04/06/16   Page: 6 of 9 PageID #: <pageID> \n7 \n alleged , it appears this may be a case where the  “injury litigated against would be incurred as a \nresult of the d isclosure of the plaintiff's identity.”  M.M. v. Zavaras , 139 F.3d 798, 803 (10th Cir. \n1998) . The disclosure of Plaintiffs ’ identities could expose their sensitive personal  and financial \ninformation - information  stolen from Avid when its computer systems w ere hacked - to public \nscrutiny and exacerbate the privacy violations underlying their lawsuit.   \nAt the same time,  there is a compelling public interest in open court proceedings, \nparticularly in the context of a class action, where a plaintiff seeks to re present a class of \nconsumers who have a personal stake in the case and a heightened interest in knowing who \npurports to represent their interests in the litigation. See Michael v. Bloomberg L.P. , No. 14 -CV-\n2657 (TPG), 2015 WL 585592 (S.D. N.Y. Feb. 11, 201 5), where the court rejected an FLSA  \nplaintiff’s request to proceed under pseudonym  on behalf of himself and others similarly \nsituated , finding his possible interest in anonymity was outweighed by the public’s interest in \ndisclosure . Although the plaintiff  offered to disclose his true identity to Bloomberg under seal, \nthe court found this arrangement “still runs against the public’s traditional right of access to \njudicial proceedings, and may also preclude potential class members from properly evaluating \nthe qualifications of the class representative.” Id. at *4.  \nThe Court has balanced Plaintiffs ’ interest in anonymity against any potential prejudice to \nAvid and the public’s interest in disclosure . The Court finds the possible injury to Plaintiffs  \nresulting  from public disclosure of their identities rises above the level of mere embarrassment or \nharm to reputation.  With respect to any prejud ice to Avid , the Court notes that Plaintiffs have \nalready agreed to provide Avid with their names subject to a protecti ve order, thereby alleviating \na barrier to defending the case.  \nThe Court has also considered the fact that these Plaintiffs are seeking to represent a \nputative class of users of the Ashley Madison website. There are significant differences between Case: 4:15-md-02669-JAR   Doc. #:  138   Filed: 04/06/16   Page: 7 of 9 PageID #: <pageID> \n8 \n the role s of class r epresentative and class member. Because class actions determine the rights of \nabsent  class members, due process requires the class be fairly and adequately represented. See \nRattray v. Woodbury Ct., IA , 614 F.3d 831, 835 (8th Cir. 2010);  Paxton v. Un ion Nat. Bank , 688 \nF.2d 552, 562 -63 (8 th Cir. 1982) ; Fed. R. Civ. P . 23(a)(4) . “The focus of Rule 23(a)(4) is \nwhether: (1) the class representatives have common interests with the members of the class, and \n(2) whether the class representatives will vigorou sly prosecute the interests of the class through \nqualified counsel. ” Paxton , 688 F.2d at 562-63. See also  Golan v. Veritas Entertainment, LLC , \n788 F.3d 814, 822 (8 th Cir. 2015).  Class representatives have a fiduciary obligation to fairly \nrepresent the enti re class, In re BankAmerica Corp. Securities Litigation , 775 F.3d 1060, 1062 n. \n1 (8th Cir. 2015) and Reynolds v. National Football League , 584 F.2d 280, 284 n.6 (8 th Cir. \n1978), and generally receive an incentive award as compensation for work done on beh alf of the \nclass.  Given the importance of the role of class representative, t he Court will require Plaintiffs to \ndisclose their identities so that the public, including the putative class members they seek to \nrepresent, know who is guiding and directing th e litigation. Because class members are not \ntypically testifying or offering evidence, they do not need to be specifically identified by name in \norder to be part of the litigation; they merely need to be identifiable.  \nBefore the consolidated complaint is f iled, Plaintiffs currently proceeding under \npseudonym who are seeking to serve as class representatives must decide whether to proceed \nusing their real names or dismiss their complaints and proceed, without public ly disclosing their \nnames, as class members – if and when a class is  certified.  The Court believes this balancing of \nthe equities does not deny a remedy to those Plaintiffs  wishing to remain anonymous.  Plaintiffs  \nreply that forcing some of them to drop their claims could leave a number of subclasses without \na named represe ntative. (Doc. No. 117 at 7) The possibility that subclasses might not be Case: 4:15-md-02669-JAR   Doc. #:  138   Filed: 04/06/16   Page: 8 of 9 PageID #: <pageID> \n9 \n \nrepresented is purely speculative at this stage of the proceedings. If this situation were to occur, \nthe Court can revisit its order.  \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that Plaintif fs’ Motion for Leave to Proceed under \nPseudonyms [91] is DENIED  in part in accordance with the rulings herein.  \n \nDated this  6th day of April , 2016 . \n         \n      ___________________________________                                                                 \n      JOHN A.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves a securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation, a company engaged in artificial intelligence software and eCRM solutions, which became publicly traded in 1999. Following a significant drop in its stock prices due to overstated revenues and subsequent bankruptcy, the class action was consolidated, resulting in a proposed settlement of $10.1 million approved by the court, as well as an award for attorney fees and expenses. The AI aspect relates to Quintus's core business as an AI software provider, which is part of the background context rather than the central legal issue.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the proposed class settlement and allocation plan related to claims of securities fraud due to misleading financial statements should be approved as fair, reasonable, and adequate.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted final approval of the class settlement and the allocation plan, determining that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate after considering several factors, including the risks of further litigation and the proportionality of the settlement to potential recovery.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if you bought a toy from a company because they advertised it as the best on the market, but then you find out the company lied about how well it worked. Lots of people who bought the toy get together to tell the company they want their money back because they were tricked. After talking it over, they agree that the company will pay a certain amount of money to everyone who bought the toy. The judge looks at the deal and says, \"Yep, this seems fair,\" and then tells the people who did all the legal work that they can get paid for their time, too.",

During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:00-cv-04264-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.

Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:00-cv-04264-VRW   Document 14   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion from the United States District Court for the Northern District of California involves a securities fraud class action lawsuit against Quintus Corporation. The case consolidates claims that Quintus made false and misleading financial statements, resulting in a significant financial loss for shareholders. The court approved a settlement of $10.1 million to be distributed among the class members, alongside the payment of attorney fees and expenses, following recognition of the company's AI-driven business dealings and associated financial misreporting during Quintus's growth period. The case involved artificial intelligence in that Quintus was an AI software company, which later offered e-Customer Relationship Management solutions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue centers on whether the proposed settlement of the securities fraud class action against Quintus Corporation is fair, reasonable, and adequate for the shareholders who suffered losses due to alleged financial misrepresentation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate. The settlement amount was approved along with the planned allocation of funds and associated attorney fees and expenses. The court emphasized the absence of objections from class members and the complexity and risks involved in continuing litigation as considerations favoring the settlement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if your favorite toy company said they had more money than they actually did because they used tricky math on their reports. People who bought the company’s stock based on that bad information lost lots of money when the truth came out, and the stock price crashed. So, a group of those people decided to sue the company to get back some of their money. In this case, everyone agreed on an amount that the company would pay to settle the fight, and the judge said, \"Well, since no one is complaining, and continuing to fight might be risky and expensive, this sounds like a good deal, so I approve.” That’s basically what happened here.",

For the reasons discussed below, finalapproval of the class settlement and plan of allocation is GRANTEDand the application for award of attorney fees and reimbursement ofexpenses is GRANTED.Case 3:01-cv-00932-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 1 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n2I\nWhen Quintus was incorporated in 1984, its business was\nartificial intelligence software.  During the class period, Quintusprovided “e-Customer Relationship Management” or “eCRM” solutions,primarily through its “eContact” software.  Quintus grew through aseries of acquisitions in 1997 through 1999.  \nAs part of an initial public offering completed November\n15, 1999, Quintus sold 5.175 million shares of Quintus common stockat $18/share.  Consistent with those heady times, the stock pricesoon reached $55/share. On February 28, 2000, Quintus announcedits intent to acquire Mustang.com, which developed corporate e-mailmanagement software.  Quintus filed a registration statement inconnection with the Mustang acquisition on March 28, 2000.\nOn November 15, 2000, its first anniversary as a publicly\ntraded company, Quintus announced that it was reviewing previouslyfiled financial statements.  The price of Quintus shares fell from$6.00/share to $2.97/share before trading was halted by NASDAQshortly after noon, representing a one-day (or less) price drop ofjust over 50%.  On November 22, 2000, Quintus announced the resultsof a financial audit, which revealed that Quintus had overstatedrevenue on several occasions.  The truth regarding Quintus’sfinancial condition continued to emerge over the next few monthsand NASDAQ delisted Quintus stock on February 16, 2001.  After twodays of over-the-counter trading, the price of Quintus common stocksank to $0.14 on February 22, 2001, when Quintus filed for Chapter11 bankruptcy.\nA flurry of class actions alleging securities fraud wereCase 3:01-cv-00932-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 2 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n3filed in this court and ultimately consolidated.  Doc #71.  The\ncourt designated the law firm of Weiss & Yourman (now Weiss &Lurie) as lead counsel pursuant to a competitive selection process. See In re Quintus Sec Litig\n, 148 F Supp 2d 967 (ND Cal 2001). \nFollowing two rounds of motions to dismiss, the court designatedRoman Reznik as lead plaintiff.  Doc #201.  \nThe first amended consolidated class action complaint,\nDoc #215 (CAC), alleges that false and misleading statements ofmaterial fact appeared in the Quintus IPO registration statement,the Mustang registration statement and various periodic financialreports.  Accordingly, the CAC asserts claims under sections 11,12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”) aswell as claims under sections 10(b), 14(a)(9) and 20(a) of theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).  Id ¶¶291-357.\nThis litigation is only one current in Quintus’s wake. \nAs noted, Quintus initiated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding inthe United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Additionally, various shareholder actions were filed in Californiaand Texas state courts.  Thus, the proposed settlement presentlyunder consideration is part of a global settlement to beadministered by the Chapter 11 trustee.  \nOn July 7, 2006, the court preliminarily approved the\nproposed settlement and certified the class.  Doc #269.  The courtordered that notice of the pending settlement and final approvalhearing be mailed to potential class members on July 25, 2006.  Doc#273.  Over 20,000 notice letters were mailed to potentialsettlement class members and shareholders of record.  Doc #277 at¶5.  Not a single class member objected to the settlement orCase 3:01-cv-00932-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 3 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n4requested exclusion from the class settlement in response to the\nnotice letter.  Id at ¶7-8.  Similarly, no objection was raised atthe final settlement approval hearing on December 5, 2006.\nII\nThe proposed settlement agreement provides that\ndefendants will pay $10.1 million in cash into a common fund to bedistributed to class members. \nThe question currently before the court is whether this\nsettlement should be approved.  “The court must approve anysettlement, voluntary dismissal, or compromise of the claims,issues, or defenses of a certified class.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(A).  Thecourt bears in mind the Ninth Circuit’s “strong judicial policythat favors settlement, particularly where complex class actionlitigation is concerned.”  Class Plaintiffs v City of Seattle\n, 355\nF2d 1268, 1276 (9th Cir 1992).  While no class member has objected,the court must still review the proposed settlement.  Manual forComplex Litigation (Fourth) §21.635 (“Even if there are no or fewobjections or adverse appearances before or at the fairnesshearing, the judge must ensure that there is sufficient record asto the basis and justification for the settlement”).\nThe court may approve a settlement “only after a hearing\nand on finding that the settlement * * * is fair, reasonable andadequate.”  FRCP 23(e)(1)(C).  A final approval hearing was held onDecember 5, 2006.  The Ninth Circuit has set forth the followingfactors for courts considering approval of class actionsettlements: Case 3:01-cv-00932-VRW   Document 13   Filed 12/05/06   Page 4 of 10United States District Court\nFor the Northern District of California1\n23456789\n10111213141516171819202122232425262728\n5(1) the strength of the plaintiffs’ case; (2) the risk,\nexpense, complexity, and likely duration of furtherlitigation; (3) the risk of maintaining class actionstatus throughout the trial; (4) the amount offered insettlement; (5) the extent of discovery completed and thestate of the proceedings; (6) the experience and views ofcounsel; (7) the presence of a governmental participant;and (8) the reaction of the class members to the proposedsettlement. \nChurchill Village v General Electric\n, 361 F3d 566, 575 (9th Cir\n2004).  These factors overwhelmingly support approval of the classsettlement.  The court discusses the settlement evaluation factorsthat are relevant in this case.  Id at 576 n7.\nThis settlement follows six years of protracted\nlitigation, discovery and negotiation.  Further litigation wouldrequire plaintiffs to survive motions for summary judgment and, ifsuccessful, present their case to a jury.  The considerable riskand cost associated with further litigation is enhanced byQuintus’s pending bankruptcy litigation.  This court noted early inthese proceedings that “plaintiffs are going to have troublefinding deep pockets in this case.”  Doc #85 at 37.  This globalsettlement divides the limited resources of a bankrupt corporationamong the many litigants suing Quintus.  Doc #276 at ¶ 6.  Much ofthe remaining value to be apportioned among the litigants is fromQuintus’s directors and officers liability insurance policies.  Thesettlement class, however, is receiving the “lion’s share” of theinsurance coverage.  Doc #276 at ¶46.  Weighing the risks and costsof further litigation, the court concludes that this settlement isadvisable.\nThe settlement amount, $10.1 million, closely resembles\nthe $9,996,000 settlement predicted by the Haas Study\n referenced by\nthis court in its previous order.

    "summary": "1. Summary: In this case, the court ruled on motions stemming from a legal dispute between Victor Tsupko and Kinetic Advantage, LLC, over a line of credit for a car dealership. The court decided to stay the federal proceedings, pending the outcome of a parallel state court case in Hamilton County concerning the same issues. The opinion noted that filings by Tsupko contained non-existent legal citations and likely relied on artificial intelligence, which raised further issues under procedural rules.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the federal court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in favor of a parallel state court proceeding involving the same parties and issues, according to the Colorado River doctrine.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court decided to stay the federal case proceedings under the Colorado River abstention doctrine, as the facts indicated there were parallel state court proceedings that would resolve the same claims. The court opted for judicial efficiency and to prevent inconsistent rulings.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you and your friend both accidentally book the same vacation, and now you're deciding whose plans to follow. The court found there were already plans ('lawsuits') in motion in a different place (state court), and rather than creating confusion with two vacations (lawsuits), it chose to stick with one. Additionally, the person trying to argue didn't do a good job with their homework, using wrong facts and possibly using a robot (AI) to help them. The court told them to be more careful next time, or there could be serious trouble.",

For the following reasons, Kinetic's \nMotion is granted in part and Tsupko's Motion is denied . \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Factual Background \nThe following facts are not necessarily objectively true, but as required when reviewing a \nmotion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true all factual allegations in the complaint and draws all inferences in favor of Tsupko as the non- moving party. See Bielanski v. Cnty. of Kane , 550 F.3d \n632, 633 (7th Cir. 2008).  \nIn 2018, Victory Motors, Inc. (\"Victory Motors\"), a car dealership owned by Tsupko, \nentered into an agreement for  a floor -plan line of credit with Kinetic —a business that provides Case 1:24-cv-01210-TWP-KMB     Document 59     Filed 09/17/25     Page 1 of 10 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n dealerships with floor planning—for $750,000.00 (the \"Note\")  (Filing No. 1 at 2). Floor planning \nis a financing option for car dealerships to purchase inventory. Id . at n.1. Then, in December 2023, \ndespite Victory Motors complying with the terms of  the Note, Kinetic froze the account. Id . at 3. \nKinetic cited dissatisfaction with the sales rate and the speed of inventory turnover as the reasons \nfor freezing the account. Id .  \nKinetic  then suggested a verbal resolution through its agents without any written agreement \nthat required Victory Motors to reduce its debt from $750,000.00 to $400,000.00 to reactivate the \naccount. Id. In response, Victory Motors reduced its debt to $338,000.00 within two months. Id . \nHowever, Kinetic continued to suspend the account without providing a clear explanation on how the account could be reopened. Id . \nFinally, o n February 21, 2024, amidst a business emergency that led to Victory Motors \ntemporarily closing, Kinetic repossessed all inventory vehicles parked on Victory Motors' premises without notice. Id . at 4.  \nB. Procedural History  \nThis case was originally filed  by Tsupko and Victory Motors  in the Eastern District of \nVirginia on March 6, 2024, alleging breach of the Note, breach of good faith and fair dealing, improper repossession of the vehicles and lack of notification of repossession ( See Filing No. 1). \nThe case was transferred to this Court on July 18, 2024 (Filing No. 25) , and in September 2024 \nPlaintiff's counsel was allowed to withdraw his appearance. Because a corporation may appear in \nthe federal courts only through licensed counsel , this Court dismiss ed Victory Motors as a plaintiff \non December 11, 2024 (Filing No. 43). Tsupko is the only remaining plaintiff.  \nOn May 23, 2024, Kinetic filed a lawsuit in the Hamilton County Superior Court against \nVictory Motors and Tsupko (the \"Hamilton County Case\") . See Kinetic Advantage, LLC v. Victory Case 1:24-cv-01210-TWP-KMB     Document 59     Filed 09/17/25     Page 2 of 10 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n Motors Inc. dba Victory Motors, and Victor v. Tsupko, 29D05-2405- PL-00574 (Ind. Super. May \n23, 2024). In the Hamilton County case, Kinetic allege s breach of the Note, breach of guaranty, \nand conversion ( See Filing No. 52-2). Tsupko and Victory Motors then filed counterclaims against \nKinetic for breach of the Note and breach of guaranty (Filing No. 52- 3 at 3 ). The Hamilton County \nCase is ongoing. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nFederal  Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6) allows  a defendant to move to dismiss  a complaint \nthat has failed  to \"state  a claim  upon which  relief  can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  When  \ndeciding a motion  to dismiss  under Rule 12(b)(6),  the court accepts  as true all factual  allegations  \nin the complaint and draws  all inferences  in favor  of the plaintiff.  Bielanski , 550 F.3d at 633. \nHowever,  courts \"are not obliged to accept  as true legal  conclusions or unsupported conclusions \nof fact.\"  Hickey  v. O'Bannon, 287 F.3d 656, 658 (7th Cir.  2002). \nThe complaint must contain  a \"short and plain  statement  of the claim  showing that the \npleader  is entitled  to relief.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  In Bell Atlantic  Corp. v. Twombly , the Supreme \nCourt explained  that the complaint must allege facts  that are \"enough to raise  a right to relief  above \nthe speculative level.\"  550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). Although \"detailed  factual  allegations\" are not \nrequired, mere  \"labels,\" \"conclusions,\" or \"formulaic  recitation[s]  of the elements  of a cause of \naction\"  are insufficient.  Id.; see also Bissessur v. Ind. Univ.  Bd. of Trs., 581 F.3d 599, 603 (7th Cir. \n2009) (\"[I]t is not enough to give a threadbare recitation  of the elements  of a claim  without factual  \nsupport\"). The allegations  must \"give the defendant fair notice of what  the . . . claim  is and the \ngrounds upon which  it rests.\"  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555. Stated  differently, the complaint must \ninclude \"enough facts  to state a claim  to relief  that is plausible on its face.\"  Hecker  v. Deere & Co., \n556 F.3d 575, 580 (7th Cir. 2009) (citation  and quotation marks  omitted).  To be facially  plausible, Case 1:24-cv-01210-TWP-KMB     Document 59     Filed 09/17/25     Page 3 of 10 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n the complaint must allow  \"the court to draw  the reasonable inference  that the defendant is liable  \nfor the misconduct alleged.\"  Ashcroft  v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing  Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 556). \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nBefore addressing the merits of the Motion to Dismiss, the Court must determine whether \nit should abstain from exercising jurisdiction under the Colorado River  doctrine. This doctrine \nstems from Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States  and permits federal courts \nto stay proceedings pending the outcome of a  \"concurrent state  proceeding for reasons of wise \njudicial administration.\" 424 U.S. 800, 818 (1976). However, \"[a]bstention from the exercise of \nfederal jurisdiction is the exception, not the rule.\" Id . at 813.  \n\"Determining whether Colorado River abstention should apply requires a district court to \nmake a two -part inquiry.\" Adkins v. VIM Recycling, Inc., 644 F.3d 483, 498 (7th Cir. 2011). \"First, \nthe court must determine whether the concurrent state and federal actions are actually parallel. If so, the court must consider second whether exceptional circumstances justify abstention.\" Id . \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Court will address each part  of the inquiry \nbelow. \nA. Parallel Suits  \nTwo suits are parallel when \"substantially the same parties are contemporaneously \nlitigating substantially the same issues.\" Tyrer v. City of South Beloit , 456 F.3d 744, 751 (7th Cir. \n2006) (internal quotation omitted). \"In essence, the question is whether there is a 'substantial likelihood that the state litigation will dispose of all claims presented in the federal case. '\" Adkins , \n644 F.3d at 499 (quoting Clark v. Lacy , 376 F.3d 682, 686 (7th Cir. 2004)).  Case 1:24-cv-01210-TWP-KMB     Document 59     Filed 09/17/25     Page 4 of 10 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n Kinetic argues that the case before the Court and the Hamilton County Case are parallel \nbecause the parties are practically the same, both cases concern the parties' dealings related to the \nNote, the counterclaims in the Hamilton County C ase are identical to the claims in this case, and \nif this case proceeds, Kinetic plans to file counterclaims identical to the claims it asserts in the \nHamilton County C ase (Filing No. 52 at 7). The Court agrees.  \nThe parties  in the two cases  are substantially similar —both parties in this case are parties \nin the Hamilton County C ase.1 Further, the state litigation will dispose of the relevant  claims \nasserted in this case. Indeed, the claims asserted in this case are identical to those asserted as counterclaims in the state litigation.\n2 \nTsupko does not provide a responsive argument other than merely stating that the \nproceedings are not parallel (Filing No. 58 at 7). As the Court will discuss later, his brief appears to have been created using some form of artificial intelligence (\"AI\") because the stated reason for \nhis conclusion that the proceedings are not parallel is  as follows: \"the federal and state cases (if \nany) are not truly parallel [Plaintiff can insert distinguishing facts here, e.g. the parties or claims differ].\" Id . Under the se circumstances , the Court determines that the two lawsuits are parallel.  \nB. Exceptional Circumstances  \nHaving concluded that the lawsuits are parallel, the Court moves to the second step of the \nColorado River  abstention doctrine —whether exceptional circumstances are present. \"[T]he court \nmust consider a number of non- exclusive factors that might demonstrate the existence of \nexceptional circumstances.\" Clark , 376 F.3d at 685 (internal quotations omitted). Thos e factors \ninclude: \n1) Whether the state has assumed jurisdiction over property; \n \n1 Victory Motors is also a party in the Hamilton County case.  \n2 While Tsupko asserts violations of the Virginia Code in this case, the Note makes clear that Indiana law applies \nwithout regard to any conflict of law principles ( Filing No. 1 -2 at 19 ).  Case 1:24-cv-01210-TWP-KMB     Document 59     Filed 09/17/25     Page 5 of 10 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n 2) The inconvenience of the federal forum;  \n3) The desirability of avoiding piecemeal litigation;  \n4) The order in which jurisdiction was obtained by the concurrent forums;  \n5) The sour ce of governing law, state or federal;  \n6) The adequacy of state- court action to protect the federal plaintiff's rights; \n7) The relative progress of state and federal proceedings;  \n8) The presence or absence of concurrent jurisdiction;  \n9) The availability of removal; and  \n10) The vexatious or contrived nature of the federal claim. \n \nTyrer , 456 F.3d at 754 (citation omitted). No one factor is determinative. Colorado River , 424 U.S. \nat 818. \"The weight to be given any one factor is determined solely by the circumstances of the \nparticular case—there is no mechanical formula by which to determine when a stay is appropriate.\" Schneider Nat'l Carriers, Inc. v. Carr , 903 F.2d 1154, 1157 (7th Cir. 1990).  \n Kinetic contends that nearly every factor weighs in favor of a stay because the claims in \nthe two cases are identical, pendency of both cases would result in piecemeal litigation and would result in conflicting rulings, no federal laws are implicated in t he dispute, and there is concurrent \njurisdiction ( Filing No. 52 at 8). Tsupko argues that the balance of factors weighs against a stay \nbecause there is no property at issue, the federal forum is not inconvenient, and his rights would not be protected in st ate court ( Filing No. 58 at 6). Here, the Court finds that the factors weigh in \nfavor of abstaining from exercising jurisdiction and staying proceedings.  \nFirst, the claims in the case before the Court are identical to those asserted in the Hamilton \nCounty case. As such, the pendency of both lawsuits is likely to result in piecemeal litigation and could bring about conflicting rulings. Indeed, although Tsupko now argues against this, he made \nthis same argument to the Eastern District of Virginia in his Motion to Notify Court of Related Case stating, \"[t]he pendency of two concurrent cases involving identical parties and similar issues poses a risk of inconsis tent rulings and unnecessary duplication of judicial resources.\" ( Filing No. \n17 at 2).  Case 1:24-cv-01210-TWP-KMB     Document 59     Filed 09/17/25     Page 6 of 10 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n Second, no federal laws are implicated in the parties' dispute. Rather, Tsupko alleges state \nlaw claims of breach of contract, breach of good faith and fair dealing, and Improper Repossession \nand Lack of Notification in violation of Virginia Code  § 8.9A -609 and 611 ( Filing No. 1 at 4–5). \nThere is also concurrent jurisdiction, and the state court proceedings have progressed further than the proceedings in this Court. Thus , the Hamilton County Superior Court can adequately protect \nTsupko's rights  and has jurisdiction over all relevant claims as the Note is governed by Indiana law \n(Filing No. 1-2 at 19). \nThe Court concludes that the case before the Court and the Hamilton County C ase are \nparallel suits, and the factors identified by the Supreme Court in Colorado River  weigh in favor of \nabstaining from jurisdiction and staying the proceedings pending the outcome of the state litigation. Accordingly, the Court need not reach the merits of the Motion to Dismiss .  \nC. Tsupko's Motion to Strike  and the Court's Admonishment  \nOn February 27, 2025, Kinetic filed a Notice of Citation to Non- Existent case law , (Filing \nNo. 55),  alerting the Court that Tsupko had provided multiple citations to cases that do not exist in \nhis response to Kinetic's Motion to Dismiss. On March 4, 2025, the Court issued its Order admonishing Tsupko, striking his brief, and providing leave for him to refile his response due to the incorrect citations ( Filing No. 56). A day later, Tsupko filed a Motion to Strike Kinetic's Notice \narguing that his citations were correct and moved for sanctions against Kinetic for falsely claiming \nthat his citations wer e incorrect ( Filing No. 57). However, Tsupko's newly filed response makes \nclear that he acknowledges his citations were incorrect  (See Filing No. 58). As such, Tsupko's \nMotion to Strike and Request for Sanctions is denied in its entirety.  \nNotwithstanding the above, the Court must once again admonish Tsupko as his newly filed \nresponse contains citations to non- existent case law and a review of his response indicates that he Case 1:24-cv-01210-TWP-KMB     Document 59     Filed 09/17/25     Page 7 of 10 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n is using some form AI. While Tsupko acknowledges that most, if not all, of his citations were to \nnon-existent cases, he once again proffers non -existent case law by citing \" Barthlow v. Jett , No. \n5:21- cv-00029, 2022 WL 1210532, at *4 (E.D. Ky. Apr. 25, 2022)\" arguing that this unpublished \nEastern District of Kentucky decision \"supports the common- sense rule that a guarantor who must \npay the debt of another can assert the legal claims that the defaulting obligor could have pursued \n(or seek reimbursement from that obligor).\" ( Filing No. 58 at 2). This case does not exist. The only \ncases the Court could find resembling this citation are from courts in Florida , none of which stand \nfor the principle Tsupko asserts . See generally  Barthlow v. Jett , 930 So.2d 739 (Fla. Ct. App. 2006) ; \nBarthlow v. Jett , 3:06- cv-1056, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 36176 (M.D. Fla. May 2, 2008) ; Barthlow \nv. Jett , 3:06- cv-1056, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 130545 (M.D. Fla. July 24, 2008) ; Barthlow v. Jett , \n303 Fed. Appx. 723 (11th Cir. 2008) ; Barthlow v. Jett , 3:06- cv-1056, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 38606 \n(M.D. Fla. 2007) ; Barthlow v. Jett , 3:06- cv-1056, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63590 (M.D. Fla. August \n20, 2008) ; Barthlow v. Jett , 2006 Fla. App. LEXIS 11073 (Fla. Ct. App. 2006) ; Barthlow v. Jett , \n926 So.2d 1272 (Fla. Ct. App. 2006) ; Barthlow v. Jett , 2006 Fla. App. LEXIS 7390 (Fla. Ct. App. \n2006); Barthlow v. Jett , 913 So.2d 600 (Fla. Ct. App. 2005).  \nIn addition to Tsupko citing another non- existent case, as discussed above, his response \nindicates the use of AI. Specifically, in arguing that the case before the Court and the Hamilton County Case are not parallel, Tsupko states, \"[a]pplying [the Huon] test here, the federal and state cases (if any) are not truly parallel [Plaintiff can insert distinguishing facts here, e.g. the parties or claims differ].\" ( Filing No. 58 at 7).  \nThe Court has already admonished Tsupko and struck his response containing non-\nexistent case law ( Filing No. 56). Rule 11 of the Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure provides, in \nrelevant part:  Case 1:24-cv-01210-TWP-KMB     Document 59     Filed 09/17/25     Page 8 of 10 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n (b) Representations to the Court. By presenting to the court a pleading, written \nmotion, or other paper—whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an . . . unrepresented party certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances: . . . .  \n(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing \nlaw or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; . . . .  \n Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b).  \nThe Court admonishes Tsupko one final time that he is not excused from compliance with \nprocedural rules, see Pearle Vision, Inc. v. Room , 541 F.3d 751, 758 (7th Cir. 2008) (noting that \n\"pro se litigants are not excused from compliance with the procedural rules\"), and any further non-\ncompliance with all applicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local Rules of this Court \nwill result in sanctions against him which may include dismissal of  this case.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, the Motion to Dismiss or Stay Proceedings  (Filing No. 52) is \nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART . The Motion is granted as to Kinetic's \nalternative request to abstain from exercising jurisdiction and stay proceedings. The Motion is \ndenied as to dismissal for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), subject to re -filing pending \nthe outcome of the state litigation. Accordingly, the se proceedings are STAYED  pending the \nresolution of the Hamilton County Case. The parties are DIRECTED to notify the Court  within \n14 days of when the Hamilton County Case is disposed.  \nIn addition, Tsupko's Motion to Strike and Request for Sanctions (Filing No. 57) is \nDENIED. Tsupko is ADMONISHED for a final time that any further citations to non- existent \ncase law will result sanctions , including possible dismissal of this action .  \nSO ORDERED. \n \nDate:  9/17/2025  \nCase 1:24-cv-01210-TWP-KMB     Document 59     Filed 09/17/25     Page 9 of 10 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n  \nDistribution:  \n \nVICTOR TSUPKO  \n11247 Ramrod Rd  \nWoodbridge, V A 22192  \n \nGregory A.

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nIn this case, Plaintiff P. Stephen Lamont accused several defendants, including Kevin J. Conner and Google Ventures, of misappropriating his trade secrets concerning his software product designs, in violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act. However, the court dismissed Lamont's claims due to lack of personal jurisdiction over the Conner Defendants and Catherine Stephanie Straggas, and insufficiently pleaded allegations regarding Google Ventures. The case involved an allegation of unauthorized disclosure of innovative ideas related to artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, though the court found no substantiated connection between Lamont's claims and Google Ventures' activities.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe principal legal issue was whether the Plaintiff adequately established personal jurisdiction over the defendants and sufficiently stated a claim for trade secret misappropriation under the Defend Trade Secrets Act.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court held that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Conner Defendants and Straggas, thus dismissing the claims against them with prejudice. The court also dismissed the claim against Google Ventures due to insufficiently detailed allegations but allowed Lamont the opportunity to amend this part of his complaint.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation:\nImagine someone claims their secret recipe was stolen by a chef they met at a restaurant, and they want to sue both the chef and the restaurant's owner for a lot of money. However, the court couldn't see enough connection between the actions of the chef or owner and where the lawsuit was filed. Also, the person didn't provide enough details about how the recipe was shared or stolen. So, the court decided the claims against the chef and an assistant involved should be dropped for good, but the person gets another chance to explain or prove their case against the restaurant's owner.",

For the reasons set forth below, Ms. Straggas’ motion to \ndismiss is GRANTED, Conner Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and GV \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED.  This court has initial subject matter jurisdiction \nunder federal qu estion and supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.  28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331, 1367(a).

As the alleged “only true inventor and designer” of “four \ninnovative software product designs” including “Proprietary Streaming Video Protocol, Cloud \nBased Transcoding and Streaming System for Media Companies, OTT Platform with Social \nMedia Layers for OEMs, and Multiscreen OTT Video Stack for Operators,” Plaintiff “owns all \nrights, title, and interest” of the “compromised assets.”  Id. ¶¶ 42, 53, 60.  Plaintiff currently \nresides at a self -identi fied “confidential” address in Santa Clara, California.  \nPlaintiff’s relationship with Conner Defendants began  in 2014  with an agreement  between \nthe parties for accounting services that required  the accounting firm  Conner & Associates  to \nprovide a “compilation” of information such as annual and quarterly balance sheets along with tax \nreturn preparations for Plaintiff’s Company  Arumai Technologies, Inc .  Compl.  ¶ 1, Ex. A.  The \naccounting firm is located in Newtown, Pennsylvania.  Compl.  ¶¶ 6-7.     \nUnrelated to Plaintiff and Conner Defendants’ tax -related relationship, Plaintiff and Mr. \nConner, CPA and Managing Partner of Conner & Associates , engaged in email correspondence in \nOctober of 2016  that included a request from Mr. Conner to Plaintiff t o “send Arumai’s \nSeptember 2016 Business Plan for his upcoming trip to Silicon Valley.”  Compl. ¶  12.  Mr. \nConner told Plaintiff that he would be “having dinner and cocktails at the Rosewood on Sand Hill \nRoad.”  Compl. , Ex. B.  Mr. Conner requested that Pl aintiff send him “a clean, fully updated \nbusiness plan” so that he could have it in his bag.  Id.  Plaintiff emailed  Mr. Conner his Business \nPlan with “Proprietary and Confidential” marked on each page along with a Non -Disclosure \nAgreement for signature in  prepar ation for Mr. Conner’s dinner.  Compl.  ¶ 12.  Two days later,  \nMr. Conner emailed Plaintiff —with “Google” in the subject line —stating “I had dinner with the \nhead of Google ventures – a hombre of a college roommate.  He now has you on his radar.  I am \ncharging you for 2 hours of my time  . . .”  Compl. , Ex. D.

E.  In response, Mr. Conner replied  that “[t]hey will do a review of the Business Plan and the \nIP; then they will get back to me as whether they are interested.  Simple as that.”  Compl. , Ex. E.   \nPlaintiff states that o n October 7, 2016, Plaintiff emailed Mr. Conner his one page \noverview of the  September 2016 Business Plan  and that Mr. Conner then sent it to Google \nVentures.  Comp.  ¶ 16.  The overview  included “the entire patent prosecution strate gy” for his \npatents numbered  “09/587,730, 09/587,026, and 09/630/939” and was also marked “Proprietary \nand Confidential.”  Compl.  ¶ 16.  Plaintiff later emailed Mr. Conner, with “Overview” in the \nsubject line, for confirmation that the Overview was sent to  Mr. Conner’s “contact.”  Compl. , Ex. \nG.  Mr. Conner replied, “YES” to Plaintiff’s email.  Id.   \nOn November 4, 2016, Mr. Conner emailed Plaintiff in regards to the response he received \nfrom his contact.  Compl.  ¶ 17.  Plaintiff requested Mr. Conner’s Goog le Venture contact \ninformation to pursue the response on his own.  Mr. Conner declined to provide the information.  \nId. ¶ 18.  Plaintiff  learn ed shortly thereafter that “Google Inc. had made a move to artificially \nintelligent solutions in its Cloud platfor m and that Google invested $4.5M on artificial intelligence \nresearch in Montreal,” Plaintiff then “noticed Conner” of this information.  Id. ¶ 21.  Mr. Conner \ndid not reply.   Plaintiff requested from Conner Defendants “an explanation and restitution of the  \nexposition of $95 million in the unauthorized disclosure of patent and product ideas” allegedly \ngiven to Google Ventures at the meeting in California.  Dkt. No. 60 -1, Decl. Conner  ¶ 22.   \nOn November 11, 2016, Ms. Straggas, counsel for Conner Defendants,  responded to \nPlaintiff’s email notice to Mr. Conner .  Ms. Straggas informed Plaintiff  that no meeting between \nMr. Conner and Google Ventures had taken  place and that at no time did anyone from Conner & \nAssociates provide Plaintiff’s information to anyone at Google V entures.  Compl. , Ex. I.  Ms. \nStraggas is also located in P ennsylvania.  Dkt. No. 36 at 3.  Mr. Conner has since admitted he was \nuntruthful when he gave Plaintiff the impression that he had met with the “head ” of Google \nVentures while in Silicon Valley.  Dkt. No. 60 -1, Decl. Conner  ¶ 14.  Mr. Conner also stated he \nwas not actually “in the State of California on October 4, 2016” nor did he mee t with David Krane Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 3 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  or any representative from Google Ventures.  Id. ¶¶ 11, 12.   \nPlaintiff  states that  he received communication in June of 2018 from Daphne Change, \nGeneral Counsel of GV, and David Kramer, an attorney, that a meeting with Mr. Krane from GV  \ndid not take place.  Compl . ¶ 25.  Mr. Krane, Chief Executive Officer of Google Ventures, \nsubmitted a signed affidavit that stated “I do not know and have never met any of the parties to \nthis action.  I did not meet with Mr. Conner, on October 4, 2016 or otherwise, and have never \ncommunicated with him.”  Dkt. No. 70 -1 at 6.   \nBased on these allegations, Plaintiff asserts claims for: (1) violation of the Defend Trade \nSecrets Act of 2016 against all Defendants predicated upon Mr. Conner’s failure to obtain a  signed \nnon-disclosure agreement when he delivered Plaintiff’s business plan to a Google Venture contact; \n(2) negligence against Conner Defendants and Ms. Straggas  under the same theory ; (3) tortious \ninterference against Conner Defendants for not forwardin g GV contac t information to Plaintiff ; \nand (4) breach of fiduciary duties against Conner Defendants by going “outside the normal role of \nan independent accountant” by disseminating Plaintiff’s proprietary and confidential information \nwithout the non -disclo sure agreement.  All Defendants subsequently filed motions to dismiss \nPlaintiff’s claims.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion to Dismiss  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires a plaintiff to plead each claim with sufficient \nspecificity to “give the defendant fai r notice of what the  . . . claim is and the grounds upon which \nit rests.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 55 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (internal quotations omitted).  \nA complaint which falls short of the Rule 8(a) standard may be dismissed if it fails to state  a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is \nappropriate only where the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support \na cognizable legal theory.”  Mendiondo v. Centinela  Hosp. Med. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th \nCir. 2008).  Moreover, the factual allegations “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level” such that a claim “is plausible on its face.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555, 570 . Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 4 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  When deciding wh ether to grant a motion to dismiss, the court generally “may not consider \nany material beyond the pleadings.”  Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v. Richard Feiner & Co. , 896 F.2d \n1542, 1555 n.19 (9th Cir. 1990).  The court must accept as true all “well -pleaded factu al \nallegations.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009).  The court must also construe the alleged \nfacts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Love v. United States , 915 F.2d 1242, 1245 (9th \nCir. 1998).  “[M]aterial which is properly submitted as  part of the complaint may be considered.”  \nHal Roach Studios, 896 F.2d at 1555 n.19.  But “courts are not bound to accept as true a legal \nconclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555.  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) allows a party to file a motion to dismiss when \nthere is a lack of personal jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  There are two limitations that \nrestrict a court’s power to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant: the \nconstitutional principles of due process and the applicable state personal jurisdiction rule.  Sher v. \nJohnson , 911 F.2d 1357, 1360 (9th Cir. 1990).  The Ninth Circuit has held that because \nCalifornia’s pers onal jurisdictional ru le is “co extensive with the outer limits of due process,” \npersonal jurisdictional inquiries under California law are constrained solely by constitutional \nprinciples.  Id. at 13 61; Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 410.10.  \nThe Supreme Court has held that constitutiona l due process is met when a nonresident \ndefendant has sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state “such that maintenance of the suit \ndoes not offend ‘traditional notions  of fair play and substantial justice. ’”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. \nWashington , 326 U.S. 3 10, 316 (1945).  In applying the minimum contacts analysis, a court may \nexercise either general or specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.  Doe v. Unocal Corp. , \n248 F.3d 915, 923 (9th Cir. 2001).  When the defendant’s activities in the forum st ate are \nsubstantial, continuous and systematic, a court may exercise general jurisdiction over the \ndefendant, even if the cause of action is unrelated to defendant’s contacts with the forum.  Id. at \n923.  A defendant may also be subject to specific jurisdi ction if the defendant “has sufficient \ncontacts with the forum state in relation to the cause of action.”  Sher, 911 F.2d at 1361 (citations \nomitted).  Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 5 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  When faced with a personal jurisdiction challenge by the defendant, the plaintiff bears the \nburden of pro of to show that jurisdiction is appropriate.  Love v. Associated Newspapers, Ltd. , 611 \nF.3d 601, 608 (9th Cir. 2010).  When a motion to dismiss is based on written materials without an \nevidentiary hearing, a plaintiff need only make a prima facie showing o f jurisdictional facts.  Id.  \nIn this context, a prima facie showing means that the plaintiff has produced sufficient admissible \nevidence, that if believed, would establish personal jurisdiction.   China Tech. Global Corp. v. \nFuller, Tubb, Pomeroy & Stokes , No. 05 -CV-1793 -JW, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 46137, 2005 WL \n1513153, at *1 , *3 (N.D. Cal. June 27, 2005) (citations omitted).   The Ninth Circuit has also held \nthat a district court shall accept as true uncontroverted allegations in the complaint and draw all \nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Love , 611 F.3d at 608; Sher, 911 F.2d at 1361.   In \ndoing so however, the court need not assume the truth of mere conclusory allegations .  China \nTech. Global Corp. , 2005 U.S. Dist. LEX IS 46137, 2005 WL 15131 53, at *5  (citing Nicosia v. De \nRooy , 72 F. Supp. 2d 1093, 1097 (N.D. Cal. 1999)).  \nB. Leave to Amend  \nIf the court concludes that the complaint should be dismissed, it must then decide whether \nto grant leave to amend.  “[A] district court should grant leave to  amend even if no request to \namend the pleading was made, unless it determines that the pleading could not possibly be cured \nby the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d at 1130  (quoting Doe v. United States , \n58 F.3d at 497 ).  Leave to amen d can be properly denied where the amendment of the complaint \nwould cause the opposing party undue prejudice, is sought in bad faith, constitutes an exercise in \nfutility, or creates undue delay.  Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Janicki Logging Co. \nv. Mateer , 42 F.3d 561, 566 (9th Cir. 1994).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Ms. Straggas’ Motion to Dismiss i s Granted  with  Prejudice  \nMs. Straggas moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s three claims against her under Rule 12(b)(2) for \nlack of personal jurisdiction  and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may \nbe granted.  Dkt. No. 36 .  The complaint alleges that Ms. Straggas’  letter , on behalf of Conner Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 6 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendants , denying the meeting in Menlo Park ever took place,  “subjected h er[] to a claim  of \nnegligence ” and a violation of the Defend Trade Secrets Act.  Compl.  at 8-12.  Plaintiff withdrew \nhis opposition and otherwise did not respond to Ms. Straggas’ motion to dismiss.  The motion is \ngranted on a lack of response alone.   However , the court  will review  the personal jurisdiction \nargument.  \nPlaintiff initially alleged personal jurisdiction is met “because all factual allegations derive \nfrom violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1836” and the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the \nnegligence claim.  Compl.  ¶ 2.   \nMs. Straggas’ action in writing a letter as counsel, on behalf of Conner Defendants, to \nPlaintiff at his New York address, does not meet the standard of “substan tial, continuous and \nsystematic ” as required under personal jurisdiction standards .  Addition ally, Ms. Straggas is \ndomiciled and employed in Pennsylvania.  Dkt. No. 36 at  3.  Thus, no general jurisdiction exists.  \nUnder specific jurisdiction, Plaintiff relies on Ms. Straggas’  letter , informing Plaintiff  the event in \nCalifornia did not take  place.  In viewing the facts most favorable to Plaintiff, it cannot be said that \nMs. Straggas consummated any transaction or purposefully directed any of her activities toward \nthe forum.  Under these facts, Plaintiff has failed to establish personal juris diction.  \nSchwarzenegger  v. Fred Martin Motor Co. , 374 F.3d 797, 802 (9th Cir. 2004)  (“If the plaintiff \nfails to satisfy either of these prongs, personal jurisdiction is not established in the forum state.”) . \nPlaintiff initially filed a response to Ms. Straggas’ motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 37) on \nAugust 22, 2018 ; however, Plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to withdraw Plaintiff’s response \n(Dkt. No. 71) which this court granted (Dkt. No. 72).  Thus, Plaintiff does not oppose Ms. \nStraggas’ motion to dismiss.   \nAccordingly, Plaintiff has not met his burden in satisfying either prong of the personal \njurisdiction analysis .  Plaintiff’s claims against Ms. Straggas are DISMISSED with  prejudice.  \nB. Conner Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is Granted with Prejudice  \nConner Defendants seek dismissal of all claims  against them for lack of  personal  \njurisdiction , general and specific, and  forum non conveniens.  Dkt. No. 60.  Plaintiff responds by Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 7 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  stating that  personal jurisdiction exists because the inju ry of misappropriation  took place in Menlo \nPark, California.  Dkt. No. 65 ¶  13.  The court agrees with Conner Defendants.      \n1. General Jurisdiction  \n“General jurisdiction applies where a defendant’s activities in the state are ‘substantial’ or \n‘continuous and systematic,’ e ven if the cause of action is unrelated to those  activities.”  Sher, 911 \nF.2d at 1361  (citations omitted) .  “[T]he plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant has \nsufficient contacts to ‘constitute the kind of continuous and systematic general business contacts \nthat approximate physical presence. ’”  In re W. States Wholesale Nat. Gas Antitrust Litig. , 715 \nF.3d 716, 741 (9th Cir. 2013).  \nHere, Plaintiff’s allegations are conclusory and without factual support.  Plaintiff alleges \nthat Conner Defendants have “substantial contacts with the District” when th ey travel to Silicon \nValley and spend $1,000 per night at a hotel.  Dkt. No. 65  ¶ 13.  Plaintiff’s statements are mere \nspeculation.  Plaintiff argues Conner Defendants have seven clients in the district which amounts \nto “significant contact” given the firm  has only one licensed practitioner.  Id. ¶ 14.  Conner \nDefendants respond by stating they do have clients with California addresses, however, services \nprovided for them by the corporation is conducted in Pennsylvania.   Dkt. No. 60 -1, Decl. Conner \n¶ 9.  Co nner Defendants are also not at home in California.  Mr. Conner resides in Pennsylvania \nand Conner & Associates, P.C. is a Pennsylvania corporation.  Dkt. No. 60 -1, Decl. Conner ¶¶  2-3.  \nNeither owns any personal property in California.  Id. ¶¶ 5-6.  Mr. Conner holds no bank accounts \nor an office in California.  Id. ¶ 10.   \nGiven Plaintiff has not ple d sufficient  facts to support exercising  general jurisdicti on over \nConner Defendants, the c ourt looks next to whether specific jurisdiction exists.  \n2. Specific Jurisdiction  \nThe Supreme Court has held that a court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a \ndefendant when the suit “arises out of or relates to actions by the defendant himself that are \npurposefully directed toward forum residents, an d where jurisdiction would not otherwise offend \n‘fair play and substantial justice.’” Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S.  462, 476 (1985) Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 8 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (citations omitted).  The Ninth Circuit has established a three -part test to determine specific \njurisdiction: (1)  the defendant must purposefully direct his activities to the forum or to a resident \nthereof, or must purposefully avail himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, \ninvoking the benefits and protections of its laws; (2) the claim must a rise out of or relate to \ndefendant’s forum -related activities; and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.  \nCollegeSource, Inc. v. AcademyOne, Inc. , 653 F.3d 1066, 1076 (9th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted).  \nPlaintiff  bears the burden to meet  the first two prongs,  then the burden shifts to the defendant to \nmake a compelling showing that an exercise of jurisdiction is unreasonable.  Id.; Sher, 911 F.2d at \n1361.  \nHere, Plaintiff argues he has satisfied the first two prongs because Conner & Associat es’ \nhas seven clients  that are located in California and that “[i]t would be oxymoronical for the Conner \nFederal defendants to state that they jumped on a flight, traveled 3,000 miles against the easterly \nflowing tail winds, stayed at the Rosewood Sand Hil l at a cost of $1,000 per night just to go to one \nmeeting where they tagged the GV defendants. ”  Dkt. No. 65 ¶  17.  Plaintiff’s arguments are  \nspeculati ve and lack substance .  Given Conner Defendants’ declaration that the meeting never \ntook place, Plaintiff  has not met his burden in showing that specific personal jurisdiction exists \nunder these circumstances.    \ni. Purposeful Direction  \nThe first prong refers to methods of purposeful availment and purposeful direction.  A \ncourt typically applies a “purposeful av ailment” analysis in cases of contract dispute, asking \nwhether the def endant has performed some act  in the forum state “thereby invoking the benefits \nand protections of its laws.”  Schwar zenegger , 374 F.3d at 802.  In cases of tortious conduct, a \ncourt typically applies a “purposeful direction” analysis, considering the effects of the defendant’s \nconduct.  Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 802 .  Here, because Plaintiff’s causes of acti on are tortious \nin nature, the c ourt will apply a purposeful direction analysis.  \n“A showing that a defendant purposefully directed his conduct toward a forum state . . . \nusually consists of evidence of the defendant’s actions outside the forum state that are directed at Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 9 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the forum, such as t he distribution in the forum state of goods originating elsewhere.”  \nSchwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 803.  The Ninth Circuit evaluates purposeful direction under a three -\npart test traceable to the Supreme Court’s decision in Calder v. Jones , 465 U.S. 783, 104 S. Ct. \n1482,  79 L. Ed. 2d 804 (1984).  The Calder effects test “requires that the defendant allegedly have \n(1) committed an intentional act, (2) expressly aimed at the forum state, (3) causing harm that the \ndefendant knows is likely to be suffered in the f orum state.”  Schwarzenegger , 374 F.3d at 803 .  \nAs to the first prong, “an intentional act is an external manifestation of the actor’s intent to \nperform an actual, physical act in the real world, not including any of its actual or intended \nresults.”  Washi ngton Shoe Co. v. A -Z Sporting Goods, Inc. , 704 F.3d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 2012).  \nAs to the second prong, there is express aiming when a defendant knows his action will have a \npotentially devastating impact upon a plaintiff who defendant knows lives or works  in the forum \nstate.  See id . at 675.  \nPlaintiff’s sole fact giving rise to personal jurisdiction over the Conner Defendants rests on \nthe alleged meeting in Menlo Park between Mr. Conner and a “head” of Google Ventures.  In a \nmotion to dismiss, Plaintiff’s allegations are usually taken as true.  However, for purposes of \npersonal jurisdiction, the court cannot accept as true allegations stated in a complaint that are \ncontradicted by affidavit.  See Alexander v. Circus Circus Enterprises, Inc. , 972 F.2d 261, 2 62 \n(9th Cir. 1992) (quoting Data Disc, Inc. v. Systems Technology Assoc., Inc. , 557 F.2d 1280, 1284 \n(9th Cir. 1977).  Here, Plaintiff alleges this meeting took place based on email conversations with \nMr. Conner.  Mr. Conner subsequently filed a declaration  recanting  his prior statement s to \nPlaintiff.  Mr. Conner states  that th e meeting never took place,  he was not in Califor nia on October \n4, 2016, nor did  he meet with anyone from Google.  Additionally , Mr. Krane, CEO of Google \nVentures, states in an affidav it that the meeting never occurred, nor is he familiar with any of the \nparties.  In light of Mr. Conner’s declaration and Mr. Krane’s affidavit, the court may not accept \nas true Plaintiff’s allegation that a meeting took place in Menlo Park.  In the absenc e of well -\npleaded facts establishing that a meeting took place in Menlo Park,  the court lacks jurisdiction \nover the Conner Defendants .

Claims Arising Out of, or Related to Forum Activities  \nTurning to the second requirement for specific jurisdiction, the Ninth Circuit has applied a \n“but for test.”  Unocal Corp. , 248 F.3d at 924.  More specifically, the court considers whether the \nplaintiff’s claims would have arisen but for Conner Defendants’  contacts with California.  Id. \n(citations omitted).  As mentioned, Plaintiff’s complaint is based on  the meeting in Menlo Park.  \nThe meeting is the only Plaintiff -related contact Conner Defendants allegedly have with \nCalifornia.  Plaintiff alleges his pat ent ideas were  exposed at this meeting, which caused  him $95 \nmillion in damages.  However, given the fact the  alleged  meeting cannot be taken as  true, the but \nfor test cannot be applied.  \niii. Reasonableness  \nAs to the final requirement, because th is court has fo und that Plaintiff has not met the \nNinth Circuit’s required burden in establishing specific jurisdiction, no further analysis is \nnecessary.  \n3. Forum Non Conveniens  \nConner Defendants also move this court to  dismiss Plaintiff’s claims on the grounds of \nforum no n convenie ns because the parties previously  litigated  part of  this matter in the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania .2  Pennsylvania is also  where Conner Defendants are located and where \ntheir business with Plaintiff  existed before his relocation to Californi a.  Dkt. No. 60 at 16 -17.  The \ncourt need not address Conner Defendants’ forum non conveniens argument because personal \njurisdiction does not exist.   \n  Accordingly, because this court does not have personal jurisdiction over the Conner \nDefendants’, their motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims is GRANTED with prejudice.  \n                                                 \n2  The court takes judicial notice of Conner Defendants’ Exhibits A through D.  Dkt. No. 60 -\n2.  It appears this actio n between Plaintiff and Conner Defendants first occurred in the Southern \nDistrict of New York in 2017.  Dkt. No. 65 at  5.  The presiding Judge transferred Plaintiff’s case \nto the Eastern District of Pennsylvania finding venue appropriate in the new Distric t.  Id.; Dkt. No. \n60 at 6.  In 2017, a court ordered Plaintiff to take a deposition in P ennsylvania.  Dkt. No. 65 at 6.  \nPlaintiff states for financial reasons he was unable to attend and withdrew the action.  Id.  Plaintiff,  \nnow residing in Santa Clara, C alifornia, brings the lawsuit to the Northern District .  Similarly, the \ncourt takes judicial notice as to GV Defendants’ request of Exhibits A through D pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Evidence 201(b).  Dkt. No. 52.

GV Defendants’ Motion to Dismis s is Granted with Leave to Amend  \nPlaintiff asserts one claim against GV Defendants of trade secret misappropriation under \nthe Defend T rade Secrets Act.  Compl.  ¶¶ 61-62.  GV Defendants move to di smiss the claim on \nthe grounds that Plaintiff fails to appropriately state a Defend Trade Secrets Act claim.  Dkt. No. \n50.  The court agrees.  \nCongress enacted the Defend Trad e Secrets Act in 2016 (the “Act ”).  See Defend T rade \nSecrets Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114 -153, §  2, 130 Stat. 376 (2016) (codified as amended at 18 \nU.S.C. §  1831 et seq.) .  The Act builds upon the Espionage Act of 1996 and provides exclusive \noriginal jurisdiction to the District Courts.  Id. § 1836.   The Act provides a right of civil action to \n“[a]n owner of a trade secret ” intended for use in commerce “that is misappropriated.”  Id. \n§ 1836 (b)(1).  A “trade secret” is considered “all forms and types of financial, business, scientific, \ntechnical, economic , or engineering information, including patter ns, plans, compilations, program \ndevices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs, or \ncodes, whether tangible or intangible, and whether  or how stored, compiled  . . .”  Id. § 1839(3).  \nAn owner maintains her trade secret if: (1) she  takes reasonable measures in keeping it secret, and \n(2) “the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being \ngenerally known to, and not being readily ascerta inable through proper means . . .  .”  Id. \n§ 1839 (3)(A) and (B).  “Misappropriation” of a trade secret occurs when: (A) the trade secret is \nacquired “by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret  was acquired by \nimproper means” or (B) “disclosure or use” occurs by a person without “express or implied \nconsent.”  Id. § 1839(5)(A) a nd (B).   \ni. Trade Secret Ownership  \n“A plaintiff need not ‘spell out the details of the trade secret, ’ Autodesk, Inc. v. Zwcad  \nSoftware Co. , 2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6361 0, at *13  (N.D. Cal. May 13, 2015).  Nevertheless, the \nplaintiff must “describe the subject matter of the trade secret with sufficient particularity to \nseparate it from matters of general knowledge in the trade or of special knowledge of those \npersons who are skilled in the trade, and to permit the defendant to ascertain at least the Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 12 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  boundaries within which the secret lies.”  Pellerin v. Honeywell Int’l, Inc. , 877 F. Supp. 2d 983, \n988 (S.D. Cal. 2012) (quoting Diodes, Inc. v. Franzen , 260 Cal. A pp. 2d 244, 253 ( 2d Dist. \n1968)).  \nHere, Plaintiff’s description of his trade secrets as stated in the complaint are not plead \nwith sufficient particularity .  Plaintiff alleges he is the  “only true inventor and designer” of “four \ninnovative software produc t designs” including “Proprietary Streaming Video Protocol, Cloud \nBased Transcoding and Streaming System for Media Companies, OTT Platform with Social \nMedia Layers for OEMs, and Multiscreen OTT Video Stack for Operators,” Plaintiff “owns all \nrights, title,  and interest” of the “compromised assets.”  Compl.  ¶¶ 42, 53, 60.   Plaintiff’s \ndescription also lacks boundaries to permit GV Defendants to ascertain where the secrets might \nlie.  Plaintiff states that several of his patent ideas are to “support Plaintiff ’s design of a Streaming \nVideo Protocol to accompany U.S. Patent No. 09/587,026 that has the earliest priority date of \nvarying transfer rates of digital video considering bandwidth fluctuations detected by the \nShannon -Hartley Theorem.”  Id. ¶ 33.  Plaintif f’s minimal and broad description of his ideas fail to \nsufficiently identify his trade secret  for his claim against GV Defendants .  Cf. Autodesk, Inc. , 2015 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 63610 , at *13 -14 (finding sufficient description of a trade secret as “source code  \nwhich comprises AutoCAD 2007 and 2008 is a trade secret, including those portions of code that \nunderlie the commands, interfaces and program files associated with the dozens of specific \nfeatures which were wrongfully acquired and used in Defendants’ ZWCAD + 2012 and 2014 \nprograms.” ).   \nii. Misappropriation  \nTo show misappropriation, the Act  requires a showing of one of two categories: (1) \nwrongful acquisition, or (2) disclosure or use of the trade secre t without consent.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 1839( 5)(A) and (B).  GV Defe ndants argue that Plaintiff fails to show any wrongful acquisition \nand that any supposed secrecy was lost.  Dkt. No. 50. at 12.        \nTo wrongful ly acqui re a trade secret, one must obtain a trade secret while having reason to \nknow that it was obtained thr ough “improper means.”  Id. § 1839(5)(A) (“misappropriation” Case 5:18-cv-04327-EJD   Document 100   Filed 03/26/19   Page 13 of 15 \nCase No.: 5:18-cv-04327 -EJD \nORDER GRANTING MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \n 14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  means “ acquisition of a trade secret by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade \nsecret was acquired by improper means.”).  Such “improper means” can include lying, paying a \nbribe,  or inducing someone to breach their confidentiality agr eement.  Id. § 1839(6)(A).  \nPlaintiff has not shown that GV Defendants wrongfully acquired or disclosed any trade \nsecrets.  Plaintiff  includes in his  complaint exhibits of emails where Plaintiff consented to Mr. \nConner sharing Plaintiff’s business plan with a potential Google contact.  Mr. Conner had \nrequested Plaintiff to send him “a clean, fully updated business plan” so that he could have it in his \nbag when he went to Silicon Valley.  Compl. , Ex. B.  Plaintiff acknowledges that he sent his \nbusiness plan to Mr. Conner for the purpose of Mr. Conner sharing that plan with the Google \ncontact.   Two days later , Mr. Conner emailed Plaintiff —with “Google” in th e subject line —stating \n“I had dinner with the head of Google ventures – a hombre of a college roommate.  He now has \nyou on his radar.  I am charging you for 2 hours of my time. Pay our Invoice!”  Compl. , Ex. D.  \nPlaintiff responded  inquiring  about what Mr.  Conner meant by “has you on his radar.”  Compl. , \nEx. E.  In response, Mr. Conner stated that “[t]hey will do a review of the Business Plan and the \nIP; then they will get back to me as whether they are interested.  Simple as that.”  Id.  \nLater, Plainti ff followed up with Mr. Conner over email with his one page overview to \naccompany his b usiness plan that included his patent prosecution strategy.  Both the overview and \nbusiness plan, according to Plaintiff, were marked p roprietary and confidential .  Plaintiff \nconfir med with Mr. Conner over email —with “O verview” in the subject line —that the O verview \nwas sent to Mr. Conner’s “contact.”  Compl. , Ex. G.  Mr. Conner repl ied in the  email, “YES.”  Id.  \nPlaintiff maintains  in his complaint and emails h is consent to disclosure of trade secrets.  Thus, \neven if the meeting did take place  (which all Defendants deny ever occurred) , there are no facts to \nsupport a theory that  Conner  or GV Defendants wrongfully acquired Plaintiff’s trade secrets.   \nSimilarly, under the secon d category of misappropriation —disclosure or use of the trade \nsecret without consent —Plaintiff  asserts that as a result from the Menlo Park meeting that  \n“Google Inc. had made a move to artificially intelligent solutions in its Cloud platform and that \nGoogle invested $4.5M on artificial intel ligence research in Montreal.”  Compl.  ¶ 21.

Plaintiff fails to connect his broad \npatent id eas to non -party Google, Inc. (or GV Defendants) moving  to artificially intelligent \nsolutions within its  own Cloud platforms.    \nMoreover, Mr. Krane, Chief Executive Officer of Google Ventures,  has stated by  affidavit \nthat he does  “not know and have never met any of the parties to this action. ”  Dkt. No. 70 -1 at 6.  \nThus, without more, Plaintiff fails to state a clai m that GV Defendants wrongfully acquired and \nused his trade secrets.   \nAccordingly,  GV Defendants’ motion to dismiss is GRANTED .  The court will allow \nPlaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint.  Any amended complaint must be filed no later \nthan April  16, 2019.  \nIV. ORDER  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff has failed to establish personal jurisdiction over Conner \nDefendants and Defendant Straggas and  has failed to sufficiently plead a claim for \nmisappropriation of trade secrets against GV Defendants.    \n1. Defendants’ requests for judicial notice is GRANTED.  \n2. Ms. Straggas’ Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. No. 36) is GRANTED with PREJUDICE.  \n3. Conner Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (Dkt.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The court case involves a lawsuit against Clearview AI, Inc., and various municipal defendants for allegedly using Clearview's facial recognition database created from scraped online images without consent, violating privacy and free speech rights under the California Constitution. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state court, determining that the inclusion of nondiverse municipal defendants was appropriate and that they were not fraudulently joined to destroy diversity jurisdiction.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the addition of nondiverse municipal defendants warranted the remand of Clearview AI's case to state court under allegations of fraudulent joinder and the ensuing privacy and constitutional claims.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that the plaintiffs had a reasonable possibility of succeeding with their claims against the nondiverse municipal defendants, thus justifying the remand of the case back to state court under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(e). The court rejected Clearview's arguments of fraudulent joinder and denied the request to sever claims against the municipal defendants.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you sued a company you think wronged you using a fancy computer program that recognizes faces in photos, which you claim violates your privacy and free speech. This company wanted the case to be heard in federal court, claiming you only added certain other defendants (like towns) to avoid being in federal court due to different rules. The judge said your tactic was valid, the case should go back to state court, and the claims against those towns could potentially be successful, so you get to try your case there, which is what you wanted.",

Consumer Privacy Litig.,  ) Case No. 21- cv-0135 \n       )   \n       ) Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman   \n       ) \n      \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n \n On June 14, 2021, defendant Clearview AI, Inc. (“Clearview”) removed the California state \ncourt action, R enderos v. Clearview AI, Inc. , to the Northern District of California  asserting that plaintiffs \nhad fraudulently joined certain def endants to destroy diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.   The judicial \npanel for multidistrict litigation transferred Renderos  to this Court on October 5, 2021, after denying the  \nRenderos plaintiffs’ motion to vacate an earlier conditional transfer order.  Before the Court is the \nRenderos  plaintiffs’ motion to remand under 28 U.S.C. §  1447(c).  For the following reasons, the Court  \ngrants plaintiffs’ motion.  \nBackgroun d \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its prior rulings in this multidistrict litigation .  In their April \n22, 2021 complaint filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, Alameda County, plaintiffs allege that they are two community -based organizations and f our political activists.  They seek \ninjunctive relief and damages against  defendant Clearview  based on allegations that Clearview i llegally \nacquir ed, stor ed, and s old their likenesses, and the likenesses of millions of Californians via Clearview’s \nsearchable facial recognition database.  Plaintiffs a ssert that Clearview scraped billions of photographs  \nfrom websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Venmo and used artificial intelligence algorithms to scan the faceprints.  Thereafter, Clearview created a searchable database containing plaintiffs’ faceprints  allow ing \nusers , including law enforcement agencies,  to identify unknown individuals  by uploading a photograph.  \nPlaintiff s bring claims under California common law, the California Constitution, and California’s \nUnfair Competition Law.\n   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 1 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Clearview is not the only defendant to this lawsuit.  Plaintiffs originally filed their  state court \naction against Clearview as the sole def endant , after which Clearview removed the lawsuit to federal \ncourt based on diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs then dismissed their a ction and filed a \nnew state court complaint , which is the operative complaint,  adding nondiverse  California municipal \ndefendants , City of El Segundo, City and County of Alameda, and City of Antioch.   As such, plaintiffs \nadded the municipal defendants before Clearview removed the operative complaint t o federal court.  \nLegal Standard1 \n“A plaintiff typically may choose its own forum, but it may not join a nondiverse defendant \nsimply to destroy diversity jurisdiction.”  Schur v. L.A. Weight Loss Centers, Inc., 577 F.3d 752, 763- 64 (7th \nCir. 2009) .  The fraudulent joinder doctrine is “ desig ned to ‘strike a reasonable balance among the \npolicies to permit plaintiffs the tactical prerogatives to select the forum and the defendants they wish to \nsue, but not to reward abusive pleading by plaintiffs, and to protect the defendants ’ statutory right to \nremove.’”  Morris v. Nuzzo, 718 F.3d 660, 666 ( 7th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted).  The doctrine  permits \ndistrict court s “to disregard the citizenship of certain nondiverse defendants, assume jurisdiction over a \ncase, dismiss the nondive rse defendants, and thereby retain jurisdiction.’”   Schur,  577 F.3d at 763 \n(citation omitted).  To establish fraudulent  joinder , the moving  party  “bears a heavy burden to show \nthat, after resolving all issues of fact and law in favor of the non- moving party, the non- moving party \ncannot establish a cause of action” against the nondiverse defendants.  Thornton v. M7 Aerospace LP,  796 \nF.3d 757, 765 (7th  Cir. 2015).  This “heavy burden” standard “ is even more favorable to the plaintiff \nthan the standard that applies to a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).”  \nSchur , 577 F.3d at 764.  Under this standard, “ the district court must ask whether there is ‘any \n \n1 Under the plain language of 28 U.S.C. §  1447(e), b ecause plaintiffs joined the nondiverse municipal defendants \nbefore Clearview removed the present lawsuit to federal court, the fraudulent joinder standard § 1447(e) does not \napply.  See  Rodarte v. Ford Motor Co., No. 18 -cv-10499, 2019 WL 1100150, at *6 (C.D. Cal. March 7, 2019)  \n(“Section 1447 (e), which applies only to ‘additional defendant s’ that a plaintiff seeks to join ‘after removal,’ is \ninapplicable here because Plaintiff named Vista in his original complaint.”).  Clearview’s reliance on a D istrict \nCourt of Maryland case does not persuade the Court otherwise.  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n reasonable poss ibility’ that the plaintiff could prevail against the non- diverse defendant.”  Id.   If \nplaintiffs have a reasonable possibility of  success  on even one of their claims against the municipal \ndefendants, the Court must count the nondiverse municipal defendants’ citizenship for jurisdictional \npurposes and remand this  case to state court.  See Smith v. Phillip Morris USA Inc., No. 18 C 6397, 2019 \nWL 4750119, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 2019) (Chang, J.).  F raudulent joinder , on the other hand,  bars \nreman d to state court .  Walton v. Bayer Corp ., 643 F.3d 994, 999 (7th Cir. 2011).     \nDiscussion  \nClearview and the m unicipal defendants first argue that  the Renderos  plaintiffs’ tort claims against \nthe municipal defendants necessarily fail because plaintiffs did not  present a claim of money damages to \nthe municipal defendants pursuant to California’s Tort Claims Act (“CTCA”) .  Indeed, under the \nCTCA, “ failure to timel y present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff from \nfiling a lawsuit against that entity.”  Committee for Immigrant Rights of Sonoma County v. County of Sonoma,  644 \nF.Supp.2d 1177, 1205 (N.D. Cal. 2009).  The CTCA, however, does not apply “to nonpecuniary \nactions, such as those seeking  injunctive , specific or declaratory relief.”  Branciforte Heights, LLC v. City of \nSanta Cruz , 42 Cal.Rptr.3d 96, 107, 138 Cal.App.4th 914, 929 (Cal. 2006).  In their motion t o remand, \nplaintiffs maintain that they are only seeking injunctive relief  against the municipal defendants , \ntherefore, the CTCA does not apply under the circumstances.    \nNonetheless, plaintiffs  cannot bring claims against the municipal defendants under California’s \ncommon law tort of misappropriation of likeness because pursuant to California’s Government Code § \n815(a), “ there is no such thing as common law tort liability for public entities .”  Quigley v. Garden Valley \nFire Protection Dist., 444 P.3d 688, 691, 249 Cal.Rptr.3d 548, 551, 7 Cal.5th 798, 803 (Cal. 2019).  The \nCourt thus considers plaintiffs’ claims brought against the municipal defendants under the California \nConstitution.  See Garcia v. City of Merced , 637 F.Supp.2d 731, 746 (E.D. Cal. 2008) . \n The Court turns to Count V of the state court complaint, which is plaintiffs’ direct claim against \nthe municipal defendants, namely, that the municipal defendants violated the guarantee of  liberty of Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n speech (freedom of speech) under article I, §  2(a) of the California Constitution.   “Article I, section 2, \nsubdivision (a) declares, ‘ Every person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all \nsubjects, being responsible for the abuse of  this right.  A law may  not restrain or abridge liberty of \nspeech  or press. ’”  Delano Farms Co. v. California Table Grape Com ., 417 P.3d 699, 708–09, 233 Cal.Rptr.3d \n45, 56–57, 4 Cal.5th 1204, 1221 ( Cal. 2018) .   \nIn their complaint , the Renderos  plaintiffs allege that the municipal defendants ’ use of \nClearview’s database has a chilling effect on their right to speech and association.  In particular, \nplaintiffs allege that the municipal defendants’ ability to search the Clearview database and their \nresultant use of the information gleaned from t he database  can lead to retribution by  law enforcement \nagainst plaintiffs who criticize the police .  Plaintiffs allege that knowing law enforcement defendants \ncan investigate and identify them via the Clearview database makes them reluctant to speak public ly at a \nrally or attend a protest.   In sum, plaintiffs’ allegations concern the right to assemble and the unlawful \nprior restraint of future speech.    \n Accordingly , plaintiffs’ allegations  also fall under art. I, §  3(a) of the California Constitution, \nwhich provides:  “The people have the right to instruct their representatives , petition government for \nredress of grievances, and  assemble  freely  to consult for the common good.”   Although there is no \nprivate right of action for damages based on a violation of art. I, §  2(a) or § 3(a) of the California \nConstitution, a private party may bring a claim for injunctive or declaratory relief under § § 2(a) and 3(a) .  \nSee Julian v. Mission C mty. Hosp., 218 Cal.Rptr.3d 38, 66, 11 Cal.App.5th 360, 391 (Cal. 2017) .  As above, \nplaintiffs are only seeking injunctive relief against the municipal defendants  as to this claim .   \n In their California complaint , plaintiffs allege that by using the Clearview database in their \ninvestigatory activities, including intelligence gathering, the municipal defendants’ conduct chills their speech and right to a ssociation.  See White v. Davis , 533 P.2d 222, 227, 120 Cal.Rptr. 94, 99, 13 Cal.3d \n757, 766 (Cal. 1975)  (“The inherent legitimacy of the police ‘intelligence gathering’ function does not \ngrant the police the  unbridled power to pursue that function by any and all means .”).  And, the Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n “California Constitution is more protective of free speech rights than the federal Constitution, and \nCalifornia courts require ‘ extraordinary circumstances ’ before a  prior  restraint  may be imposed. ”  \nMolinaro v. Molinaro,  245 Cal.Rptr.3d 402, 408, 33 Cal.App.5th 824, 832 (Cal. 20 19).  Clearview \nnevertheless argues plaintiffs cannot succeed on their  liberty of speech claim by citing a case i n which \nthe California Court of Appeal, Second District, held the “ Constitution, section 2(a) cannot be read to \nsupport a cause of action for injunctive relief where an individual is seeking to be rehired by her \nemployer.”   McAllister v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 157 Cal.Rptr.3d 720, 735, 216 Cal.App.4th 1198, \n1217 (Cal. 2013) .  Clearly, McAllister  does not apply under the circumstance s. \nDefendants’  other arguments fail to meet their  “heavy burden”  that there is no “ reasonable \npossibility ” plaintiffs can establish their speech/right to assemble claim against the municipal \ndefendants.  See Thornton,  796 F.3d at 765.  For example, Clearview argues plaintiffs’ claims implicate \nthe First Amendment, and thus, the  Court should retain jurisdiction.  It is well -settled, however , that \nplaintiffs are the master of their own complaint.  See  Prairie Rivers Network v. Dynegy Midwest  Generation,  \nLLC , 2 F.4th 1002, 1012 ( 7th Cir. 2021) .  If plaintiffs wanted to bring a First Amendment claim  in \nfederal court , they could have, but rather they chose to bring their claims under the California \nConstitution.  See Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc.,  984 F.3d 1241, 1246 ( 7th Cir. 2021)  (plaintiffs “ may \nchoose to rely exclusively on state law and avoid f ederal -question jurisdiction. ”).  Similarly, the \nmunicipal defendants argue plaintiffs have not established Article III standing to be in federal court.  \nThis argument works in favor of remand because without Article III standing, the proper course of action is to remand this lawsuit to state court.  Id.  at 1249; Collier v. SP Plu s Corp. , 889 F.3d 894, 897 ( 7th \nCir. 2018) .  In the end, defendants have not met their “heavy burden” to show that there is no \nreasonable possibility that the Renderos  plaintiffs can prevail on their claim in Count V.  Therefore, the \nCourt grants plaintiff s’ motion to remand  on this basis.  See  Smith , 2019 WL 4750119, at *2 . \nNext, in  Count IV,  plaintiffs bring an aiding and abetting claim against the municipal \ndefendants based on Clearview’s alleged  invasion of privacy in violation of the California Constitution, Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n art. I,  §  1.  To establish their claim against Clearview, plaintiff s must show (1) they possess a legally \nprotected privacy interest, (2) they maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy, and (3) defendant ’s \nconduct constituted a serious invasion of privacy.    Hill v.  National  Collegiate  Athletic  Assn. , 865 P.2d 633, \n654-55, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 7 Cal.4th 1 (Cal. 1994) .  In the Court’s February 2022 motion to dismiss \nruling, the Court concluded that the California Subc lass had plausibly alleged a right to privacy claim \nunder the California Constitution against Clearview.   Specifically, the Court concluded that the named \nplaintiff sufficiently alleged Cle arview’s conduct constituted a serious  invasion of her privacy because \nbiometric information, by its very nature, is sensitive and confidential.  \nThe Court therefore examines the Renderos  plaintiffs’ allegations of aiding and abetting against \nthe municipal defendants.  U nder California law, a defendant can be held liable for aiding and abe tting \nwhere defendant knows the underlying conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives the original  \ntortfeasor substantial a ssistance or encouragement .  See Barrett v. Apple Inc. , 523 F .Supp.3d 1132, 1145 \n(N.D.  Cal. 2021) ; S&S Worldwide, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank , 509 F.Supp.3d 1154, 1165 (N.D. Cal. 2020) .  \nSpecifically, “ California law ‘necessarily’ requires that for aiding and abetting liability to attach, a \ndefendant [] made ‘a conscious decision to participate in tortious activity for the purpose of assisting \nanother in performing a wrongful act.’”   George v. eBay, Inc ., 286 Cal.Rptr.3d 492, 508, 71 Cal.App.5th \n620, 641 (Cal. 2021)  (citation omitted).    \n In their state court complaint , plaintiffs allege that Clearview interacted with the City of \nAlameda Police Department to obtain a Clearview database license.   They further allege that despite the \nCity of Alameda passing a  resolution concerning the use of facial recognition, police officers and other \nemploy ees of  the City of Alameda and Alameda County continued to use the Clearview database by \nuploading images to conduct  investigatory searches.  Also, p laintiffs contend that Clearview uploaded \nthese images and corresponding biometric information to its database for future searches .  They further \ncontend police officers employed by the City of El Segundo and the City of Antioch have used and \ncontinue to use the Clearview database in this manner and that Clearview uploaded these images to its Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n database for future searches.   Plaintiffs maintain the municipal defendants knew Clearview’s conduct \nbreached a duty to plaintiffs and that the municipal defendants provided substantial assistance to \nClearview in its  unlawful conduct by subscribing to Clearview, paying for Clearview’s database, and/or \npromoting the use of the database to  their employees.   \n It is reasonable to infer from p laintiffs ’ alleg ations  that the  Alameda defendants made a \nconscious effort to continue using Clearview’s facial recognition database after the municipal ordinance \nwas passed.   This alone, however, does not come close to alleging th at the municipal de fendants made a \nconscious decision to participate in Clearview’s tortious activity in order to assist Clearview in \nperforming a wrongful act.   See George , 286 Cal.Rptr.3d at 508.   Meanwhile, p laintiffs’ remaining \nallegations do not link the municipal defendants to Clearview’s invasion of privacy , which i s based on \nthe sensitive and confidential nature of biometric information.   As such, defendants have met their \nburden that plaintiffs have no “ reasonable possibility ” of prevailing  on their aiding and abetting claim.   \n Last, i n the alternative, Clearview argues that the municipal defendants are misjoined in this \naction under Federal Rule of Civil Pr ocedure 20(a) and should be severed under Rule 21.  Clearview \nmaintains that “[e]ven if plaintiffs satisfy the requirements for permissive joinder under Rule 20 (a), the \ncourt has discretion to sever a party at any time [ ] if doing so will increase judicial economy and avoid \nprejudice to the litigants.”   Bozek v. Wal –Mart Stores, Inc. , No. 15- cv-10, 2015 WL 3818984, at *2 (N.D. \nIll. 2015) (Darrah, J.) (citation o mitted).  Here, Clearview does little to convince the Court that the \nRenderos  plaintiffs will not suffer prejudice if the Court were to exercise its discretion and sever the \nclaims against the municipal defendants from this lawsuit.  The Court denies Clear view’s request  to \nsever the municipal defendants . \nConclusion  \n For these reasons, t he Court  grants the Renderos  plaintiffs’ motion to remand under 28 U.S.C. § \n1447(e)  [192].  The Court denies the municipal defendants’ motions for a judicial determination of \nfraudulent joinder, but grants their motions to remand [192, 209, 210, 211].

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The plaintiff, Joseph Lee Jones, alleged that he lost access to his Google Plus web address and various Google services after Google shut down Google Plus in 2019, and thereby claims Google violated the Kansas Consumer Protection Act (KCPA). The court dismissed the complaint, ruling that Jones's allegations did not sufficiently establish a plausible claim for a violation of the KCPA as they lacked specific details, such as particular false representations or a defined consumer transaction. AI is indirectly involved through Google's misrepresented status as an artificial intelligence research company in the plaintiff's claims. \n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the plaintiff's allegations sufficiently state a claim for relief under the Kansas Consumer Protection Act (KCPA) with the necessary specificity.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the plaintiff failed to state a plausible claim for relief under the KCPA as the allegations lacked the necessary specificity regarding the time, place, and content of false representations, as well as what constituted a consumer transaction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** A person sued Google because they couldn’t access their Google Plus page and other services. They said Google broke some consumer protection rules. The court said the person didn't explain well enough how Google really broke the rules and dismissed the case. Google mentioned AI stuff in their company details, but it wasn’t the main issue here.",
    "full_text": "1 \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS \n \n \nJOSEPH LEE JONES, \n \n                    Plaintiff,  \nvs.                                     Case No. 20-3072-SAC \n \nGOOGLE LLC, INC., \n \n                    Defendant.        \n \nO R D E R \n This case is before the court upon defendant’s motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) (Doc. No. 7) and other motions filed by plaintiff.  Plaintiff is proceeding pro se.  This \ncase was originally filed in state district court and removed to this court by defendant. I. The complaint and proposed amended complaint. \n Plaintiff’s original complaint alleges that a web address – www.google.com/+JoeJones21176  - is no longer accessible and \ntherefore materials plaintiff has stored at the address cannot be \nviewed and that plaintiff has lost access to “various Google services.”  Doc. No. 1-1, p. 2.  Plaintiff alleges that the web address was lost around June 2019 when Google Plus was shut down.  Id. at p. 5.  He contends that he “responded to solicitations for \nservices sold in the State of Kansas via the internet” and that now he is unable to benefit from the transactions in violation of Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 1 of 112 \n the Kansas Consumer Protection Act (KCPA) , K.S.A. 50-626 & 627.  \nId.  He further asserts that “Google is a business, a supplier of \nservices it advertises for free, but responding and utilizing amounts to a consumer transaction.”  Id.  He complains that an \neducational and teaching platform has been made unavailable and that this marginalizes him because he has no place to direct people to see his works.  Id. \n Proposed amendments to the state court petition, which are part of plaintiff’s motion to amend filed in state court the day before this case was removed, include the following contentions: \n- that despite defendant’s representations the web \naddress was not permanently accessible for posts and as \na repository of works; \n- that defendant misrepresented its status as an \nartificial intelligence research company; \n- that defendant misrepresented Google Plus as original \nor new; \n- that defendant misrepresented the uses of Google Plus; - that the receipt of the Google Plus web address “was \ncontingent upon plaintiff Joseph Jones Amazon eKindle book volumes;” and  \n- defendant made representations with reason to know \nthat the web address would not have use after 2019; \n- defendant represented to plaintiff that Google Plus \nhad been substantiated to have the benefit of a community \nof users with the same interests (i.e., transhumanism, \nfuturism, etc.) and the defendant made such \nrepresentation to plaintiff with reason to know that \nGoogle Plus could no longer connect other transhumanists and futurists with the same interests. \nDoc. No. 16, pp. 4-11. Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 2 of 113 \n  \nII. Pro se standards \nPro se pleadings are entitled to a liberal construction.  Hall \nv. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991).  A pro se \nlitigant, however, is not relieved from following the same rules \nof procedure as any other litigant. See Green v. Dorrell, 969 F.2d \n915, 917 (10th Cir. 1992).  A district court should not have to guess at what claim a pro se litigant is making (Wells v. Brown, \n891 F.2d 591, 594 (6th Cir. 1989)), nor “assume the role of advocate \nfor the pro se litigant.” Hall, 935 F.2d at 1110. \nIII. Rule 12(b)(6) standards \nPlaintiff’s complaint must allege sufficient facts to state \na legal claim which is plausible on its face.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  Facial plausibility requires “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  A \ncomplaint will not “suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ \ndevoid of ‘further factual enhancement.’” Id. (quoting Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).   \nThe plausibility standard is not akin to a “probability \nrequirement,” but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.  \nWhere a complaint pleads facts that are “merely \nconsistent with” a defendant’s liability, it “stops \nshort of the line between possibility and plausibility \nof ‘entitlement to relief.’” Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 3 of 114 \n Id. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557).  A plausibility analysis \nis a context-specific task depending on a host of considerations, \nincluding judicial experience, common sense and the strength of competing explanations for the defendant's conduct.  See id. at \n679; Twombly, 550 U.S. at 567. \nHere, plaintiff is making claims under the KCPA, K.S.A. 50-\n626 & 627. The KCPA concerns “consumer transactions” which are defined as “a sale, lease, assignment or other disposition for value of property or services.”  K.S.A. 50-624(c).  Claims of false representations or unconscionable acts violating the KCPA must be stated with particularity.  J amieson v. Vatterott Educational \nCenter, Inc., 473 F.Supp.2d 1153, 1156-58 (D.Kan. 2007); \nNieberding v. Barrette Outdoor Living, Inc., 2012 WL 6024972 *2 \n(D.Kan. 12/4/2012)(applying requirement to allegations of \nunconscionable acts under KCPA).   \n“[T]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint asserting \ndeceptive practices under the KCPA ‘must set forth the time, place, and contents of the false representation, the identity of the party making the false statements and the consequences thereof.’”  Cavolovic v. J.C.Penney Corp., Inc., 2018 WL 2926433 *2 (D.Kan. \n6/7/2018)(quoting Weckhorst v. Kansas State Univ., 241 F.Supp.3d \n1154, 1176 (D.Kan. 2017)); Jamieson, 473 F.Supp.2d at 1156.  In \ndetermining whether an act or practice is unconscionable under the KCPA, a court may consider a large number of factors such as:  Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 4 of 115 \n whether the supplier took advantage of the inability of the \nconsumer to protect his interests; whether the price grossly exceeded the price available to similar consumers; whether the consumer was unable to materially benefit from the subject of the \ntransaction; whether there was a reasonable probability of payment \nin full by the consumer; whether the transaction was excessively one-sided in favor of the supplier; whether the supplier made a misleading statement of opinion relied upon by the consumer; and whether the supplier excluded, modif ied or limited applicable \nwarranties.  K.S.A. 50-627(b); see also State ex rel. Stovall v. \nDVM Enterprises, Inc., 62 P.3d 653, 658 (Kan. 2003)(discussing \nother factors).  \nIV.  The allegations in the complaint and motion to amend fail to \nstate a claim. \nThe court concludes that plaintiff’s complaint, even if \nsupplemented with the allegations in the motion to amend, fails to plausibly allege KCPA violations with the particularity required by law.  Plaintiff does not allege facts describing a consumer transaction as defined in the statute.  Further, plaintiff does not allege the time, place and the particular contents of false \nrepresentations, or the identity of the person making the false \nrepresentation, or the consequences of a specific false representation.  Plaintiff generally alleges he has lost access to a certain community of people with common interests and that people Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 5 of 116 \n have lost access to his works, but he does not plausibly describe \nhow this has caused him a material loss.  \nPlaintiff’s allegations also fail to set forth a \ncomprehensible and plausible claim for relief upon some grounds \nother than the KCPA.  The court notes that Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) \nrequires that a claim of fraud be stated with particularity.   V. Other motions \n A. Motion for default judgment \n Plaintiff has filed a motion for default judgment.  Doc. No. 5.  This motion shall be denied.  The record shows that defendant timely removed this action from state court and timely filed a motion presenting defenses allowed under the federal rules after \nremoval.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(c)(2)(C).  Therefore, defendant has \npresented a defense and is not in default.  Furthermore, default judgments are disfavored by courts, particularly when any delay has not caused plaintiff prejudice.  See In re Rains, 946 F.2d \n731, 732-33 (10th Cir. 1991). \n B. Motion for appointment of counsel \n Plaintiff has filed a motion for appointment of counsel.  Doc. No. 14.  Upon review of the nature and merits of plaintiff’s claims \nand the other factors listed in Rucks v. Boergermann, 57 F.3d 978, \n979 (10th Cir. 1995), the court shall deny the motion for \nappointment of counsel.  Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 6 of 117 \n  C. Motion for amicus brief \n Plaintiff has asked the court to order an amicus brief from \nthe Attorney General of Kansas.  Doc. No. 27.  This motion shall be denied because the complaint fails to state a claim and because \nplaintiff does not cite authority which supports such an order. \n D. Motion to correct caption \n Plaintiff has filed a motion to name “XXVI Holdings, Inc.” and “ALPHABET” as a defendant.  Doc. No. 11.  This motion is apparently in reaction defendant’s disclosure of corporate interests which shows that defendant is a wholly owned subsidiary of XXVI Holdings Inc. and that XXVI Holdings Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.  Doc. No. 4.   The court shall deny the \nmotion because plaintiff does not provide grounds to show that \neither XXVI Holdings Inc. or Alphabet Inc. is responsible for the alleged wrongful acts listed in the complaint.  See U.S. v. \nBestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 61 (1998)(“It is a general principle of \ncorporate law . . . that a parent corporation . . . is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.”).  E. Motions for joinder \n Plaintiff has sought to join this case with Case No. 18-4032-\nSAC.  Doc. Nos. 31 and 39.  But, Case No. 18-4032 is closed and \nthe court has refused to reopen it upon plaintiff’s motion to alter or amend judgment.  Also, this case shall be closed with this Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 7 of 118 \n order.  Under these circumstances, the motions for joinder should \nbe denied.   F. Motion for discovery \n Plaintiff has filed a motion to proceed to discovery.  Doc. \nNo. 15.  This motion shall be denied because the court shall grant \ndefendant’s motion to dismiss.  G. Motions for temporary restraining order and declaratory \njudgment \n Because plaintiff has not stated a plausible claim for relief and has not demonstrated a reasonable or substantial probability of success on the merits, his motions for a temporary restraining order and declaratory judgment (Doc. Nos. 12 and 26) shall be \ndenied. \n H. Motion for change of venue \n Plaintiff’s motion for change of venue (Doc. No. 28) shall be considered moot.  I. Motion to compel \n In Doc. No. 18, docketed as a motion to compel, plaintiff asks that defendant answer the allegations in the motion to amend the petition filed in state court.  The court has considered those \nallegations in ruling upon the motion to dismiss and finds that it \nwould be futile to grant the motion to amend.  Therefore, the motion to compel shall be denied.  Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 8 of 119 \n  J. Motion for enhanced penalties \n Plaintiff has filed what is titled a motion for enhanced \npenalties.  Doc. No. 34.  The pleading appears to make arguments against defendant’s motion to dismiss.  The court has considered \nthese arguments as well plaintiff’s contentions in the various \nresponses, notices, and affidavits he has filed.  See Doc. Nos. 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 30, 32, and 35.  The court is convinced that plaintiff has failed to state a plausible claim for relief and for this reason the motion for enhanced penalties shall be denied.  K. Motion for summary judgment \n Plaintiff has filed a motion for summary judgment.  Doc. No. \n36.  The motion shall be denied because the court has determined \nthat plaintiff’s complaint fails to state a claim.  Also, the motion fails to follow the procedures for summary judgment motions set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) and D.Kan.R. 56.1(a).  L. Motion for reconsideration supplement \n Plaintiff has filed a motion for reconsideration “supplement” which has this case number and Case No. 18-4032 listed on it.  It appears that the motion relates to the order denying plaintiff’s \nmotion to alter or amend judgment in Case No. 18-4032.  The court \nhas reviewed the motion and finds that it does not warrant relief in this case.  Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 9 of 1110 \n  \n M. Motion in support of undisputed facts (Case No. 18-4032) \n The court notes that plaintiff filed a motion docketed in Case No. 18-4032 which also has this case number written on it.  \nThe motion suggests that plaintiff’s cases may have merit because \nopposing counsel has not opposed appointment of counsel.  The motion asks for appointment of counsel and denial of defendant’s motion to dismiss in Case No. 18-4032.  For the reasons explained earlier in this order and in Doc. No. 20 of Case No. 18-4032, the relief requested in this motion is denied.   N. Request for restrictions on filing \n Defendant has asked that the court place restrictions against \nplaintiff filing in state and federal court.  Plaintiff is treated \nas a “three-strikes” litigant in federal court, so he is already under some restrictions.  See Jones v. Douglas County Jail, 2020 \nWL 1492703 (D.Kan. 3/27/2020).  The court is reluctant to place limits upon state court filings.  The state court is capable of deciding if filing restrictions are appropriate there.  Therefore, at this time the court shall deny the request for filing restrictions, although future filing restrictions in this case and \nCase No. 18-4032 will not be ruled out. \nVI. Conclusion \n For the above-stated reasons, the motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 7) is granted and this action shall be dismissed with prejudice.  Case 5:20-cv-03072-SAC   Document 42   Filed 04/14/20   Page 10 of 1111 \n Consistent with this order, the motions at Doc. Nos. 5, 11, 12, \n14, 15, 18, 26, 27, 29, 31, 34, 36, 39 and 40 are denied.  Defendant’s request for filing restrictions is also denied without prejudice. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n Dated this 14th day of April 2020, at Topeka, Kansas. \n                       s/Sam A.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: William Naughton filed a class action lawsuit against Amazon, claiming the company collected biometric data, including facial geometry, from employees during wellness checks without consent, violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The court denied Amazon's motion to dismiss, finding the allegations sufficient to state a plausible claim under BIPA, which concerns privacy protections against unauthorized collection and distribution of biometric data. AI and associated technologies are central to the case, as Amazon's alleged use of facial recognition systems for biometric data collection is a primary issue.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Amazon violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act by collecting, possessing, and disclosing employees' biometric data without informed consent, a retention policy, or destruction guidelines.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Amazon's motion to dismiss, ruling that the plaintiff's allegations plausibly claim that Amazon collected and possessed biometric data in violation of BIPA, by requiring employees to undergo facial scans as a condition of employment and potentially disseminating this data without consent.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine your job asked you and everyone else to have their faces scanned every day before work, but they never asked if it was okay or told you how long they'd keep this information. A worker, named William, took this issue to court because it's against privacy rules in Illinois for companies to do this without permission. The court said, \"We need to look into this more,\" instead of stopping the case, because William's complaint about his privacy being invaded makes sense.",
    "full_text": "1 \n  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN DIVISION  \n \nWilliam Naughton , individually and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated,  \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nv. \n Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com, \nLLC,  \n \nDefendant s.  \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \nCase No. 20-cv-6485  \n \n Judge Mary M. Rowland  \n   \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n Plaintiff William Naughton claims that, during the COVID -19 pandemic, his \nemployer, Defendant Amazon, required wellness checks as a condition to his entry \ninto the warehouse where he worked.  These wellness checks  included scans of \nNaughton’s  facial geometry —a type of sensitive biometric data.   Naughton, on behalf \nof himself and other putative class members,  claims that Amazon has taken this data \nwithout his consent  and has further disclosed the information to other parties in \nviolation of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).  Amazon has \nmoved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  [36].  For the reasons explained below, this Court denies Amazon’s motion.   \nI. Background  \nDefendants Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com, LLC (collectively, Amazon) \noperate a leading multinational technology company specializing in e -commerce, \ncloud- based servicing, streaming, and artificial intelligence.  [33] ¶ 1.  The named Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 1 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Plaintiff, William Na ughton, worked for Amazon as a “Picker” from September to \nOctober 2020 at one of its fulfillment warehouses in Joliet, Illinois.  Id.  ¶ 2.   \nIn approximately June 2020, Amazon began requiring its workers  to provide \nscans of their facial geometry, and possi bly other biometric information, as part of a \nwellness check prior to being allowed to access the facility each day.  Id.  ¶ 4.  \nNaughton alleges, on information and belief, that Amazon uses facial recognition \ndevices and associated software at their fulfil lment centers and warehouse locations \nthroughout Illinois.  Id.  ¶ 6.  The facial recognition devices and associated software \ncollect and capture biometric identifiers including facial geometry, retinas, and irises.  \nId. ¶ 7.  Amazon also scans and records workers’ temperatures.  Id.   Naughton claims \nthat, as a result of Amazon’s conduct, he and the putative class members lost their \nrights to control the collection, use, and storage of their biometric identifiers and \ninformation.  Id. ¶ 9.  Naughton also claims he and the other class members “were \nexposed to ongoing, serious, and irreversible privacy risks.”  Id.    \nNaughton alleges that Amazon never informed him it was collecting, obtaining, \nor storing his biometric data; never develop ed or adhered to any publicly available \nretention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying Naughton’s biometric data; and never obtained Naughton’s consent for any disclosure or dissemination of \nhis biometric data to third parties.  Id.  ¶ 46.  Naughton has never seen, been made \naware of, or been able to find any biometric data retention policy,  nor does he know \nof any policies regarding whether Amazon will ever permanently delete his biometric \ndata.  Id.  ¶ 48.  Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n Naughton brings claims on behalf of himself and a class of people defined as: \n“All employees  who entered  Defendant’s  locations  in the State  of Illinois  who had \ntheir  facial  geometry  scans,  biometric  identifiers,  and/or biometric  information \ncollected,  captured,  received,  or otherwise obtained,  maintained,  stored,  disclosed, or  \ndisseminated by Defendant during the  applicable  statutory period.”   Id. ¶ 59.  His \nfirst amended complaint asserts claims for:  failing to institute, maintain, and adhere \nto publicly available retention schedule and destruction guidelines in violation of 740 \nIll. Comp. Stat. § 14/15(a) (Count I); failing to obtain informed written consent and release before collecting or obtaining  biometric identifiers or information in violation \nof 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 14/15(b) (Count II); and disclosing or disseminating biometric identifiers and information before obtaining consent in violation of 740 Ill. Comp. \nStat. § 14/15(d) (Count III).  \nAmazon has moved to dismiss the first amended complaint in full.  [36].  \nII. Legal Standard  \nA motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of a counterclaim , not the merits of \nthe case.   Gunn v. Cont’l Cas. Co. , 968 F.3d 802, 806 (7th Cir. 2020).  To survive a \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the counterclaim “ must provide enough factual \ninformation to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face and raise a right to relief above the speculative level. ”  Haywood v. Massage Envy Franch ising, LLC , 887 \nF.3d 329, 333 (7th Cir. 2018) (quoting Camasta v. Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc. , 761 \nF.3d 732, 736 (7th Cir. 2014) ); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)  (requiring a complaint  \nto contain a  “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n entitled to relief” ).  A court deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion  accepts the well-pleaded \nfactual allegations  as true  and draws all permissible  inferences in the pleading \nparty’s  favor.   Degroot v. Client Servs., Inc. , 977 F.3d 656, 659 (7th Cir. 2020) .   \nDismissal for failure to state a claim is proper  “when the allegations in a \ncomplaint , however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.”   Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007) .  Deciding the plausibility of the claim is  \n“a context -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial \nexperience and common sense.”   Bilek  v. Fed. Ins. Co., 8  F.4th 581, 586–87 (7th Cir. \n2021)  (quoting W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schumacher, 844 F.3d 670, 676 (7th Cir. \n2016) ). \nIII. Analysis  \nA.  BIPA  \nThe Illinois General Assembly adopted the Biometric Information Privacy Act  \nin 2008 in response to increased commercial use of biometric data.  Cothron  v. White  \nCastle Sys.,  Inc., No. 20 -3202, --- F.4th ---, 2021 WL 5998537, at *1 (7th Cir. Dec. 20, \n2021) .  The Act protects a person’s privacy interests in his or her biometric ide ntifiers, \nincluding fingerprints, retina and iris scans, hand scans, and facial geometry ; it does \nso by regulating the collection use, retention, disclosure, and dissemination of \nbiometric identifiers, providing  a cause of action for persons “aggrieved” by  a \nstatutory  violation.  Fox v. Dakkota  Integrated  Sys.,  LLC, 980 F.3d 1146, 1148 (7th \nCir. 2020) ; see also  Bryant  v. Compass Grp. USA,  Inc., 958 F.3d 617, 620 (7th Cir. \n2020),  as amended  on denial  of reh’g  and reh’g  en banc (June 30, 2020).   A successful Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n plaintiff recovers the greater of actual damages or statutory damages of $1,000 for \neach negligent violation and $5,000 for each reckless or willful violation.  Cothron , \n2021 WL 5998537, at *1.  \nNaughton’s first amended complaint implicates  three BIPA sections.  Section \n15(a) requires private entities “in possession of biometric identifiers or biometric information” to “develop a written policy, made available to the public, establishing \na retention schedule and guidelines for perm anently destroying biometric identifiers \nand biometric information .”  740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(a).  Section 15(b) provides that \na private entity may not  “collect, capture, purchase, receive through trade, or \notherwise obtain” a person ’s biometric  data without first providing notice to and \nreceiving consent from the person .  Id. § 14/15(b).   And section 15(d) provides that a \nprivate entity may not “disclose, redisclose, or otherwise disseminate”  biometric  data \nwithout consent .  Id.  § 14/15(d).   \nB.  Sufficiency of Allegations  \nAmazon attacks the sufficiency of Naughton’s allegations on a variety of \ngrounds , but ultimately, none a re persuasive  under the Rule 12(b)(6) standard .1 \nFirst, Amazon argues that the FAC fails to plausibly state that Amazon \npurposely collected any data that could qualify as biometric data, thus dooming \nNaughton’s section 15(b) claim.  As discussed, section 15(b)  makes it unlawful to \n“collect, capture, purchase, receive through trade, or otherwise obtain” a \n \n1 Amazon disputes that it collect ed Biometric Data in the “wellness checks” it conducted on employees \nvia “thermal cameras ”. (Dkt. 32 at 9). At this stage , the Court is obligated to accept the facts as pled \nin the complaint as true. Ultimately Plaintiff will have the burden of proving this fact.  Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n person ’s biometric  data without his  or her  written consent.  Cothron , 2021 WL \n5998537, at *4 ( quoting  740 Ill. Comp. Stat.  14/15(b) ).  Amazon emphasizes that \ncourts in this district have interpreted section 15(b) to impose liability only if an \nentity takes, at a minimum, “an active step to collect, capture, purchase or otherwise \nobtain biometric data.”  Jacobs v. Hanwha Techwin Am., Inc. , No. 21 C 866, 2021 WL \n3172967, at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 27, 2021)  (emphasis added) ; see also Heard v. Becton, \nDickinson & Co. , 440 F. Supp. 3d 960, 966 (N.D. Ill. 2020)  (Heard I ).  Amazon  insists  \nthat Naughton has not plausibly alleged that is has taken any “active step” to collect \nhis biometric data , citing two cases from this district dismissing section 15(b) claims \nfor omitting such allegations.   [37] at  8.     \nThe cases upon which Amazon relies are distinguishable. In Namuwonge v. \nKronos, Inc. , the district held that the plaintiff failed to allege a plausible section \n15(b) claim against a third -party vendor (a timekeeping tracking company)  that \ncollected information based on plaintiff clocking in via her fin gerprints as required \nby her employer. 418 F. Supp. 3d 279, 286 (N.D. Ill. 2019) .  The court reasoned that \nthe complaint’s allegations made clear that it was the employer, not the vendor itself, that collected the biometric data.  Id.   To the contrary, in Heard v. Becton, Dickinson \n& Co. , the court originally dismissed a section 15(b) claim against a supplier of \nfingerprint equipment because the complaint did not explain how the supplier, as \nopposed to the employer, actively collected the biometric data.  440 F. Supp. 3d 960, \n967 (N.D. Ill. 2020)  (Heard I ). The plaintiff in  Heard  filed an amended complaint that \nthe court subsequently found stated a claim under section 15(b) by alleging that the Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n supplier of the fingerprint equipment “ extracts the unique features of that fingerprint  \nto create a user template, and then stores users’ biometric  information both on the \ndevice and in [its] servers. ” See Heard v. Becton, Dickinson & Co. , 524 F. Supp. 3d \n831, 841 (N.D. Ill. 2021)  (Heard II ).  \nIn contrast to Namuw onge and consistent with the reasoning of Heard II , the \nfirst amended complaint here asserts that Amazon collects the data for its own use.  \nThe allegations also state that Amazon has imposed this requirement on warehouse \nworkers like Plaintiff as a condition of their employment.  By asserting that  Amazon \nitself implemented the facial scans and re quired workers to submit to these scans as \na condition of work, Naughton plausibly alleges Amazon  took an “active step” in \ncollecting his biometric data.  See, e.g. , King v. PeopleNet Corp. , No. 21 CV 2774, 2021 \nWL 5006692, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2021)  (finding that a complaint adequately \nalleged a section 15(b) violation by asserting that the plaintiff did not known of or \nconsent to her employer’s collection of her fingerprints during a  mandatory  \nonboarding process) . \nSecond, Amazon argues that Naughton insufficiently pleads  Amazon’s \n“possession” of biometric data , thus failing to meet a central element of his section \n15(a) and (d) claims.  [37] at 10.  As Amazon correctly recognizes, these BIPA sections \napply only to a  private entity “in possession  of biometric identifiers or biometric \ninformation.”  740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(a), (d) (emphasis added).  Amazon contends \nthat Naughton has not adequately alleged that Amazon collected his biometric data \nand that this failur e also necessarily means that Amazon could not have possessed Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n his biometric data.  [37] at 10.  Again, this Court disagrees.  As explained above, by \nrequiring that Naughton submit to scans disclosing his facial geometry, Amazon has \ntaken the requisite “act ive step” in collecting , and thus also possessing,  the data.  \nBeyond that,  Naughton also specifically asserts that Amazon stores his biometric \ndata in a database.  [33] ¶ 44.  This plainly satisfies the “possession” requirement at \nthe pleadings stage.  \nFina lly, Amazon argues that because Naughton has failed to allege “collection” \nand “possession” of data, he has also failed to allege that Amazon disclosed any \nbiometric data in violation of section 15(d).  [37] at 10– 11.  For the same reasons as \nexplained abo ve, this Court rejects the notion that Naughton’s allegations fail to \nsatisfy the “collection” and “possession” requirements under the statute.  Amazon also \ncontends that Naughton’s section 15(d) falls short because although  he claims that \nAmazon disclosed his biometric data to third parties, he does not more fulsomely allege what data Amazon disclosed, when or where the disclosure occurred, or to \nwhom the disclosure occurred.  [37] at 11.   But Amazon seeks to impose a height ened \nstandard where there is none; all Naughton must plead is “ plausible dissemination.”   \nCothron  v. White  Castle Sys.,  Inc., 467 F. Supp. 3d 604, 618 (N.D. Ill. 2020) .  He has \ndone so here by indicating that Amazon has collected his facial geometry, discl osed \nthat data to “other Amazon entities” and to “third -party biometric device and software \nvendor(s)” and other possible third parties.  [33] ¶¶ 4, 34.  The law does not demand \nmore at the pleadings stage.   \nIV. Conclusion  Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n \nFor the reasons explained above,  this Court denies Amazon’s motion to dismiss \n[36]. Naughton’s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to substitute \nnamed plaintiff [48] remains under advisement. The Court will not require Amazon \nto answer the first amended complaint until aft er ruling on the pending motion to \nsubstitute.  \n \n \nDated: January 3, 2022   \n \n \nE N T E R:  \n  \n \n MARY M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a class action lawsuit against Clearview AI, Inc., alleging that the company covertly scraped over three billion facial images from the internet and used AI algorithms to scan and extract biometric identifiers without consent, violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The court denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration concerning waived arguments related to personal jurisdiction, Article III standing, and BIPA's government-contractor exemption, while providing clarification on specific issues like the status of a defendant, Thomas Mulcaire, in the case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants waived their arguments regarding personal jurisdiction, government-contractor exemption under BIPA, and Article III standing, and whether the plaintiffs have adequately claimed violations under BIPA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration on the grounds that the defendants did not present sufficiently developed arguments earlier and waives any new arguments raised in the reconsideration motion. The court clarifies that Thomas Mulcaire remains a defendant in the lawsuit.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company took billions of online pictures secretly and used fancy computer programs to identify people's faces without asking for permission, breaking a law meant to protect people's faces as private information. People sued, and the company tried to argue that some parts of the lawsuit were not fair or had been wrongly decided. The court said, \"Sorry, you can't bring up these complaints now because you didn't speak up properly when you had the chance,\" but did clarify that one person they thought was out of the case is actually still in it.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN DIVISION  \n \n      ) \nIn re Clearview AI, Inc., Consumer Privacy  ) Case No. 21- cv-0135 \nLitigation,      )  \n      ) Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman  \n      ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \nOn February 14, 2022, the Court granted in part and denied in part the Clearview \ndefendants’  motion to dismiss  brought pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and \n12(b)(6) .  Before the Court is defendants’ motion for reconsideration and clarification under Rule \n54(b) .  For the following reasons, t he Court, in its discretion, denies defendants ’ motion for \nreconsideration and grants the motion for clarification.  The Court also denies defendants ’ request \nfor oral argument on their motion because it is unnecessary . \nBackground  \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its February 14, 2022 Memorandum, Opinion, and \nOrder, along with the Court’s other rulings in this multi -district litigation (“MDL”) , inclu ding the \nAugust 12, 2020 Memorandum, Opinion, and Order denying defendant s Hoan Ton- That’s and \nRichard Schwartz’s motion to dismiss  brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal \njurisdiction  in the first -filed lawsuit in this MDL, Mutnick v. Clear view, 20-cv-0512.  The Court also \npresumes familiarity with its January 27, 2022 motion to dismiss ruling in relation to retail defendant \nMacy’s and the March 18, 2022 ruling denying Macy’s motion to certify an interlocutory appeal \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b ). \nIn their first amended consolidated class action complaint, plaintiffs allege  the Clearview \ndefendants covertly scraped over three billion photographs of facial images from the internet and then used artificial intelligence algorithms to scan the face geometry of each individual depicted  to Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 1 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n harvest the individuals’ unique biometric identifiers and corresponding biometric information.  \nPlaintiffs thus a llege the Clearview defendants’ conduct violated their privacy rights and defendants’ \nuse of their  biometric information was without their knowledge and consent.   The centerpiece of \nthis MDL and plaintiffs’ class action lawsuit is the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 \nILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”) . \nLegal Standard  \nBecause the Court’s February 14, 2022 ruling did not dispose of this case in its entirety, the \nCourt reviews defendant s’ reconsideration motion under Rule  54(b) , which allows the Court to \nexercise its inherent authority to reconsider its interlocutory orders because such orders are “subject \nto revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.”  See  Fed.R.Civ.P. \n54(b); Terry v. Spencer,  888 F.3d 890, 893 (7th Cir. 2018) .  Rule 54(b) motions for reconsideration \nserve the limited function of correcting manifest errors of law or fact.  See Rothwell Cotton Co. v. \nRosenthal & Co. , 827 F.2d 246, 251 (7th Cir. 1987) .  A manifest error of law is the “wholesale \ndisregard, m isapplication, or failure to recognize controlling precedent. ”  Oto v. Metropolitan Life Ins. \nCo., 224 F.3d 601, 606 ( 7th Cir. 2000)  (citation omitted).   “Such problems rarely arise and the \nmotion to reconsider should be equally  rare.”  Bank of Waunakee v. Rochester Cheese Sales, Inc. , 906 F.2d \n1185, 1191 ( 7th Cir. 1990)  (citation omitted).  \nDiscussion  \n In the present motion, the Clearview defendants request the Court to reconsider the \nfollowing:  (1)  defendants Thomas Mulcaire  (“Mulcaire”)  and Rocky Mountain Data Analytics, LLC \n(“Rocky Mountain”) waived their  personal jurisdiction defenses; (2)  Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain \nwaived the government -contract or exemption pursuant to 740 ILCS 14/25(e) ; (3) plaintiffs have \nArticle III standing to br ing the ir state law claims in Counts 8 -12 and 1 4; and (4) plaintiffs  have Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n Article III standing to bring their BIPA Section 15(c) claims in Counts 3 and 4.  Defendants also ask \nthe Court to clarify whether defendant Mulcaire was dismissed from this lawsuit . \nWaiver  \nThe Court starts with Mulcaire’s and Rocky Mountain’s waiver of their personal jurisdiction \ndefense.   To give context, in their opening brief, the  only time the  Clearview defendants raised \nMulcaire’s and Rocky Mountain’s personal jurisdiction defense was in footnote #2 , which state d:  \nMulcaire and Rocky Mountain also should be dismissed because the Court lacks \npersonal  jurisdiction over  them.  For similar reasons previously discussed by \nClearvie w, Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain did not  purposefully avail themselves of \nIllinois to establish minimum contacts with the state.  See Mutnick v.  Clearview AI , Inc., \n20-cv-512, ECF No. 46 at 6- 12, ECF No. 70 at 9- 16.  \n \nThe citation to Mutnick  and the cited briefs in footnote #2 support defendants ’ unsuccessful attempt to \ndismiss defendants Ton- That and Schwart z based on the lack of personal jurisdiction.  B ecause the \ncursory argument in footnote #2 was woefully inadequate , the Court concluded Mulcaire and Rocky \nMountain had waived  their personal jurisdiction argument .  See White v. United States , 8 F.4th 547, 552 \n(7th Cir. 2021) (“ perfunctory  and undeveloped arguments …are waived .”); Evergreen Square v. \nWisconsin Housing & Economic Dev. Auth. , 848 F.3d 822, 829 ( 7th Cir. 2017) (“ A party may  waive  an \nargument by presenting it only in an undeveloped footnote.” ). \nNow, the Clearview defendants argue the Court’s conclusion was a “manifest error” because \nthey cited fifte en pages of briefing  about personal jurisdiction in Mutnick .  There is no question \nthose briefs discussed the legal authority supporting defendants’ Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss \nbased on personal jurisdiction, but the factual focus was entirely on defendants Ton- That and \nSchwartz.  Indeed, Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain were not named defendants in Mutnick  or Hall v. \nCDW Government, LLC , 20-cv-0846.  In any event, analyzing personal jurisdiction is a fact -specific \ntask, and the Clearview  defendants did not provide the Court any factual reasons why Mulcaire and \nRocky Mountain did not have sufficient contacts with Illinois.  Therefore, the Court did not commit Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n a manife st error in this respect.  See  Oto, 224 F.3d at 606 (“ A ‘manifest error’ is not demonstrated by \nthe disappointment of the losing party.”).    \nLikewise, Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain waived their argument under the government -\ncontractor exemption to BIPA, 740 ILCS 14/25(e ), because they made this argument for the first \ntime in their reply brief.  In the present motion, defendants argue the only reason they made this \nargument for the first time in reply was due to a Cook County Circuit Court decision issued after \nthey filed their motion to dismiss, namely, Thornley v. CDW -Government , LLC, 20 CH 04346 (Cir. Ct. \nCook Cty . June 25, 2021).  Defendants contend this was the first time any court directly addressed \nthe government -contractor  exemption  under §  25(e).  That may be, but the main reason why \narguments made for the first time in reply  briefs  are waived is because the opposing side has not had \nthe opportunity to address the issue.  See White , 8 F.4th at 552- 53.  Defendants nonetheless contend \nthey put plaintiffs on notice of the state court Thornley  decision in a February 2, 2022 supplemental \nauthority letter, but that letter discusses a Northern District of Illinois case and personal jurisdiction.  \n(R. 274, 2/2/22, letter ).  This argument fails.  \nMeanwhile, defendants contend “[s]ince the Court will eventually need to address Mr. \nMulcaire’s and RM’s government -contractor defense, it would be more economical to do so now.  \nThe Court declines defendants’ invitation to address their  argument at this juncture because neither \nside has fully developed it.   The Court  thus  denies this aspect of defendants’ reconsideration motion.  \nArticle III Standing  \nDefendants also assert the Court committed a manifest error of law in concluding plaintiffs \nhad Article III standing to bring their state court claims in Counts 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14 because the \nCourt’s conclusion conflicts with TransUnion , LLC v. Ramirez , 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2200 (2021), and \nThornley  v. Clearview, 984 F.3d  1241, 1246 (7th Cir. 2021).  Defendants specifically argue plaintiffs do \nnot have Article III standing relying on Thornley  where the Seventh Circuit concluded the  plaintiffs Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n did not suffer any injury from defendant’s violation of §  15(c) except for statutory violations , and the \npresent plaintiffs’ allegations in the state court claims are “virtually identical” to the Thornley  claims.  \nDefendants’ reliance on the Sev enth Circuit ’s decision in Thornley  is misplaced because  in that matter \nthe plaintiffs purposely brought bare BIPA claims with no allegations of injuries  to avoid federal \ncourt jurisdiction.  Thornley , 984 F.3d at 1246;  Thornley  v. Clearview AI,  Inc., No. 20- cv-3843, 2020 WL \n6262356, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2020) (Coleman, J.) (“Plaintiffs purposely narrowed their claim to \nthe general prohibition of Clearview selling and profiting from plaintiffs ’ biometric data and filed \ntheir lawsuit in state court where such actions are allowed without the constraints of Article III \nstanding.”) .  Despite defendants’ argument to the contrary, class plaintiffs currently include \nallegations of injury  in their first amended consolidated class action complaint , including that \ndefendants’ nonconsensual taking and use of plaintiffs’ biometric information exposed them to \nnumerous imminent and impending injuries.   \nMoreover, d efendants’ reliance on T ransUnion  for the proposition that a victim of a privacy \nharm can only suffer an injury -in-fact for Article III standing if the victim’s information is \ndisseminated to a third -party is also unavailing.  T o clarify, in the context of the Fair Credit \nReporting Act (“FCRA”), the TransUnion  Court concluded that  certain  class members whose credit \nreports were not disseminated to third parties did not suffer a concrete injury -in-fact, keeping in \nmind that “history and tradition offer a meaningful guide to the types of cases that Article III \nempowers federal courts to cons ider.”   Id. at 2204.  As the TransUnion  Court clarified,  “with respect \nto the concrete -harm requirement in particular, this Court ’s opinion in Spokeo v. Robins  indicated that \ncourts should assess whether the alleged injury to the plaintiff has a ‘close rel ationship’ to a harm \n‘traditionally’ recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts” and that  this “inquiry \nasks whether plaintiffs have identified a close  historical  or common- law analogue for their asserted \ninjury.”  Id .  In TransUnion , the Supreme Court analogized the FCRA violations to the tort of Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n defamation, which requires that the defamatory statement be published to a third party.  Id . at 2209.  \nAccordingly , the TransUnion Court concluded that plaintiffs whose reports wer e not disseminated to \nthird parties did not allege a concrete injury -in-fact under the FCRA.  \nThe Seventh Circuit has analogized BIPA violations to common law privacy torts, which are \ndifferent common law torts than  defamation .  See Fox v. Dakkota Integrated Sys ., LLC,  980 F.3d 1146, \n1153 ( 7th Cir. 2020) ; Bryant  v. Compass Group USA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, 627 (7th Cir. 2020).  As the \nBryant  court held:  “ Bryant was asserting a violation of her own rights —her fingerprints, her private \ninformation—and that this is enough to show injury -in-fact without further tangible consequences.   \nThis was no bare procedural violation; it was an invasion of her private domain, much like an act of \ntrespass would be. ”  Id. at 624.  Therefore, defendants’  argument based on TransUnion  is without \nmerit . \nThe remainder of defendants’ arguments concerning Article III standing and plaintiffs’ state \nlaw claims were made for the first time in their reconsideration motion, and therefore, are waived. \nSee Baker v. Lindgren , 856 F.3d 498, 503 ( 7th Cir. 2017) .  Otherwise, defendants’ arguments \nconcerning “demonstratively false allegations” and plaintiffs’ lack of evid entiary support are best left \nfor summary judgment  or trial . \nNext , defendants maintain plaintiffs do not have Article III standing to bring their BIPA \nSection 15(c) claims in Counts 3 and 4, although defendants admit that they did not move to dismiss \nthese  claims in their motion to dismiss.  Again, arguments raised for the first time in a motion for  \nreconsideration are waived.   \nDefendant Mulcaire  \nIn addition, defendants seek clarification of a footnote in the Court’s February 14, 2022 \nruling about  defendant  Mulcaire.  The section of the ruling discussed whether Ton- That and \nSchwartz could be  liable for Clearview’s conduct under Delaware’ s personal participation doctrine.   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n See Prairie Capital III, L.P. v. Double E Holding Corp ., 132 A.3d 35, 60 (Del. Ch. 2015)  (“As the human \nthrough which the corporate principal acts, ‘ [a] corporate  officer can be held personally liable for the \ntorts he commits and cannot shield himself behind a corporation when he is a participant. ”).  The \nfootnote concerning Mulcaire stated:  “Plaintiffs do not argue that Clearview’s General Counsel, \nThomas Mulcaire, personally participated in the privacy torts by directing, ordering, ratifying, \napproving, or consenting to the tortious acts.  Therefore, he is not individually liable for Clearview’s \nactions. ”  The footnote, however, makes no mention of the  personal participation doctrine in \nrelation to Mulcaire’s involvement with Rocky Mountain.  Therefore, Mulcaire remains a defendant \nto this lawsuit.  \nOn a final note, the Court reminds the parties that motions for reconsideration do not \nprovide “ a vehicle for reargu ing previously rejected motions.”  Oto, 224 F.3d at 606.  As the Seventh \nCircuit instructs, manifest errors of law or fact rarely arise and motions for reconsideration should \nbe equally as rare.  See Bank of Waunakee , 906 F.2d at 1191.  As courts in this di strict have repeatedly \nreminded litigants, district courts’ opinions “are not intended as mere first drafts, subject to revision and reconsideration at a litigant’s pleasure.”  Ellenby Tech ., Inc. v. Fireking Security Group , 533 F.Supp.3d \n656, 660 (N.D.  Ill. 2021) (citation omitted).   With this in mind, before filing any further \nreconsideration motions, the parties must first seek leave from the Court to do so.  \nConclusion  \nThe Court, in its discretion,  denies defendants’ motion for reconsideration, but grants the \nmotion for clarification, namely, that Mulcaire remains a defendant to this lawsuit  [307].  The Court \nalso denies defendants’ request for oral argument on their motion for reconsideration because it is unnecessary [333].   Before filing any fu rther reconsideration motions in this lawsuit, the parties must \nfirst seek leave from the Court to do so.

The court dismissed the case based on a lack of personal jurisdiction, as Wemagine, a Canadian company, did not purposefully conduct business or direct marketing towards Illinois specifically, despite having users in Illinois.\n   \n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court has personal jurisdiction over Wemagine.AI LLP, a Canadian company, given its app is used by residents in Illinois but does not specifically target the Illinois market.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it does not have personal jurisdiction over Wemagine.AI LLP because the company's interaction with Illinois was merely through the users’ actions (downloading and using the app) rather than targeted business activities by the company towards the state.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if someone made a fun online app that turns your photo into a cartoon. People everywhere can use it, including folks in Illinois. A person from Illinois said the app broke a special Illinois law about keeping your face data safe. But, the court said, \"Hey, this app didn't really focus on dealing in Illinois specifically—they just made an app anyone can use. So we can’t make them show up here in court.\"",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN DIVISION  \n \nRICARDO GUTIERREZ , ON BEHALF OF \nHIMSELF AND OTHERS SIMILARLY \nSITUATED , \n \n  Plaintiff , \n \n   v. \n \nWEMAGINE .AI LLP,  \n \n  Defendant .  \n \n NO. 21 C 5702  \n \n Judge Thomas M. Durkin  \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \nPlaintiff Ricardo Gutierrez brought this putative class action against \nDefendant Wemagine.AI LLP (“Wemagine”), alleging violations of the Illinois \nBiometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/1, et seq . Before \nthe Court is We magine ’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction , R. 9 . That \nmotion is granted.  \nBackground  \nWemagine is a limited liability partnership incorporated in Canada. Ricardo \nGutierrez  is an Illinois citizen. Wemagi ne develops and owns a mobile application, \nVoila AI Artist (“Voila”  or “App”), which uses artificial intelligence to extract a \nperson’s face from a photo and transform it to look like a cartoon. Wemagine collects \nthe facial geometry and biometric data of Voila user s.  \nOn September 23, 2021, Gutierrez filed a two -count class action complaint \nagainst Wemagine, alleging violations of BIPA . Specifically, Gutierrez alleges Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 1 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Wemagine violated Sections 15(b) and 15(d) of BIPA when it collected, captured, used, \nand stored Gu tierrez’s biometric data without first obtaining a written release and \nby disclosing or otherwise disseminating his biometric information without obtaining \nwritten consent, as is required by the statute. Wemagine filed its motion to dismiss \non November 1, 2021, arguing this Court lacks jurisdiction over Wemagine.  \nLegal Standard  \n“A complaint need not include facts alleging personal jurisdiction. However, \nonce the defendant moves to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(2) for lac k of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of \ndemonstrating the existence of jurisdiction.” Purdue Research Found. v. Sanofi -\nSynthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. 2003). The court reads the complaint \n“liberally, in its entirety, and with every inference drawn in fa vor” of the plaintiff to \ndetermine whether it has set forth a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction.” Cent. \nStates, Se. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v. Phencorp Reinsurance Co. , 440 F.3d 870, \n877-78 (7th Cir. 2006). “[O]nce the defendant has submitted affidavits or other \nevidence in opposition to the exercise of jurisdiction, the plaintiff must go beyond the \npleadings and submit affirmative evidence supporting the exercise of jurisdiction.” \nPurdue , 338 F.3d at 783.  \nBecause this Court is sitting in diversity, it has personal jurisdiction over the \nparties to the extent that an Illinois court could exercise such jurisdiction. Philos \nTechs., Inc. v. Philos & D, Inc. , 645 F.3d 851, 855 n.2 (7th Cir. 2011). “Illinois  extends \npersonal jurisdiction to the limits allowed by the United States Constitution, so the Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n state and federal standards are congruent here.” Id. There are two forms  of personal \njurisdiction —general and specific.1 “Specific personal jurisdiction is a ppropriate \nwhere (1) the defendant has purposefully directed [its] activities at the forum state \nor purposefully availed [itself] of the privilege of conducting business in that state, \nand (2) the alleged injury arises out of the defendant’s forum -related activities.” N. \nGrain Mktg., LLC v. Greving , 743 F.3d 487, 492 (7th Cir. 2014) (citing Burger King \nCorp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 472 (1985)). The exercise of specific jurisdiction \n“must also comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial  justice.” N. \nGrain , 743 F.3d at 492. In general, “[t]he defendant’s conduct and connection with \nthe forum state must be substantial enough to make it reasonable for the defendant \nto anticipate that [it] could be haled into court there.” Id. (citing Burger  King , 471 \nU.S. at 474).  \nAnalysis  \nGutierrez argues Wemagine has sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois \nbecause it has over 5,000 Viola users in Illinois, which , Gutierrez contends,  shows \nWemagine purposefully availed itself and directed its data collection efforts in the \nforum state. Gutierrez further  argues that his claims arise out of or relate to \nWemagine’s Illinois conduct —namely, the collection of Illinois residents’ biometric \ndata from their use of Viola. R. 12.  \nWemagine contends it has not purposefully availed itself to the privilege of \nconducti ng business in Illinois, as it is essentially an interactive website and did not \n \n1 Gutierrez does not argue the Court has general jurisdiction over Wemagine.  Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n specifically direct any business to Illinois. R. 10 at 6 -7. Wemagine p oints to  ample \ncase law from this  circuit and district which is in line with its position. See, e.g., \nbe2LL C v. Ivanov , 642 F.3d 555, 558 -59 (7th Cir. 2011) (explaining that a defendant \nmust “in some way target the forum state’s market” beyond “simply operating an \ninteractive website that is accessible from the forum state”); Gullen v. Facebook , 2016 \nWL 245910,  *6 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 21,  2016) (“[T ]he Seventh Circuit has rejected the notion \nthat an online merchant’s operation of an interactive website is sufficient to confer \nspecific jurisdiction on it in every state from which it can be accessed.”)2.  \nThe Court ag rees with Wemagine. The only connection between Wemagine and \nIllinois is Gutierrez. Gutierrez chose to download the Viola app. There was no \ndirected marketing specific to Illinois, and the fact that Viola is used by Illinois \nresidents does not, on its own,  create a basis for personal jurisdiction over Wemagine. \nPut simply, there must be a stronger connection between Illinois and Wemagine to \nsubject Wemagine to court proceedings in this district. This holding is in line with \nrecent holdings in this circuit and district —those  Courts that found personal \n \n2 Gutierrez argues Gullen  “clearly departs” from the case law in this district. R. 12 at \n8. However , Gutierrez cites cases in which defendants did significantly more than \nsimply run a n interactive  website accessible from the forum state. See id . (citing  \nNorberg  v. Shutterfly, Inc. , 152 F. Supp. 3d 1105,  1105  (N.D. Ill. 2015)  (finding \njurisdiction where the defendants offered photo printing services and shipped hard \ncopy photographs and other products to Illinois customers); Monster Energy Co.  v. \nWensheng , 136 F.  Supp. 3d  897, 906 (N.D. Ill.  2015) (finding jurisdiction where \ndefendants shipped counterfeit products to Illinois residents); Mercis B.V.  v. \nPartnerships and Unincorporated Associated Identified on Schedule ‘A’ , 2021 WL \n4699007, *1 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 19, 20 21) (finding jurisdiction where the defendant was \n“ready, willing, and able” to ship counterfeit products to Illinois)). The Court does not \nagree that Gullen departs from the case law in this district, and regardless , the \nSeventh Circuit ’s holding in Ivanov  is controlling on this Court.  Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n jurisdiction were presented with a more significant connection to Illinois than \nGutierrez has shown here. The Seventh Circuit found personal jurisdiction in Curry \nv. Revolution Labs., LLC , where online purchasers selected an Illinois shipping \naddress , receiv ed a confirmation email confirming their Illinois address , and received \nproducts in the mail . 949 F.3d 385, 389 (7th Cir. 2020). Similarly, i n King v. PeopleNet \nCorp. , personal jurisdiction existed where the defendant had provided products and \nservices to the pl aintiff’s employer. 2021 WL 5006692, * 6 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 18, 2021). The \ndefendant in King  entered into business contracts with multiple Illinois businesses \nand shipped devices to them. Id. The district court found that the defendant \npurposefully availed itself when it “sought out the Illinois timekeeping market.” Id. \nat *7 .  \nOn the othe r hand, in Stein v. Clarifai , the district court found that personal \njurisdiction was not present  where the only alleged tie with Illinois was that the \nplaintiff lived here, used an interactive dating website, and the defendant worked \nwith a Chicago -based venture capital fund whose principals founded the dating \nwebsite. Stein , 526 F. Supp. 3d 339 (N.D. Ill. 2021). The defendant in Stein  was a \ntechnology company in New York that collected photos from the plaintiff’s social \nmedia profile and used her biometri c facial information without her consent. The \ncourt held the defendant merely ran an interactive website that did not specifically \ntarget Illinois residents and had no other relevant ties to Illinois. Id. at 344. This was \ntrue even though the defendant sol d its demographic model directly to two Illinois \ncustomers. Id. The court found it would be unjust to subject the defendant to personal Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n jurisdiction in this district because the contacts with Illinois did not come from “suit -\nrelated activity with the forum state.” Id. “To hold otherwise would mean that a \nplaintiff coul d bring suit in literally any state where the defendant shipped at least \none item.” Id. at 345 -46 (citing Advanced Tactical Ordnance Ss., LLC v. Real Action \nPaintball , Inc., 752 F.3d 796, 801 (7th Cir. 2014)) ; see also Salkauskaite v. Sephora \nUSA, Inc. , 2020 WL 2796122, *5 (N.D. Ill. May 30, 2020) (no personal jurisdiction \nwhere the defendant did not target its marketing or sales toward Illinois, and the fact \nthat “the technology was used in Illinois does not establish minimum contacts”); Bray \nv. Lathem Tim e Co. , 2020 WL 1492742, *2 (C.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2020) (no personal \njurisdiction where the defendant had no directed advertising toward Illinois even \nthough its web -service was available there, because “the plaintiff cannot be the sole \nlink between the defen dant and the forum”); McGoveran v. Amazon Web Services, \nInc., 488 F. Supp. 3d 714 , 722  (S.D. Ill. 2020) (no personal jurisdiction where  the \ndefendant was registered to do business in Illinois, because “nothing about the \n[allegedly harmful conduct] occurred  in Illinois except for the [action of the \nplaintiffs].”).  \nGutierrez only alleges that Viola is available and used by Illinois residents. R. \n12 at 3 (“Plaintiff is an Illinois resident who used the App in Illinois and alleges that \nhis facial geometry was collected by the Defendant in Illinois.”). Unlike the \ndefendants in King  and Curry , there is no evidence that Wemagine purposefully \ndirected any of its conduct toward Illinois , did any Illinois -specific shipping, \nmarketing , or advertising , or sought out the Illinois market  in any way . Indeed , Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n Wemagine is not registered to do business in Illinois, has no employees in Illinois, \nand any alleged harm in this case was oc casioned by  Gutierrez’s conduct of \ndownloading and using the Viola App .  \nDue process requires that a defendant be  haled into the forum state based on \nits own affiliation with the state, not “random, fortuitous, or attenuated” contacts \nmade by interacting with persons affiliated with the state. Walden  v. Fiore , 571 U.S. \n277, 286 (2014)  (citing Burger King , 471 U.S. 462, 475 (1985)). The only contact with \nthe forum state here is Gutierrez (and other members of the putative class) \ndownloading an app and using it. This attenuated contact is not sufficient for the \nCourt to exercise personal jurisdiction over W emagine, and to do so would essentially \nbe to hold that Wemagine is subject to personal jurisdiction in the entire United \nStates , because Viola is available nationwide (as well as internationally) . Because \nGutierrez has not demonstrated that Wemagine has minimum contacts with Illinois \nor directed its suit -related actions at Illinois so as to subject it to this Court’s \njurisdiction, the Court must dismiss his complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.  \nConclusion  \nFor the reasons set forth above , Wemag ine’s motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction, R. 9, is granted. If Gutierrez wishe s to seek leave to file an \namended complaint, he must do so no later than twenty -one (21) days from the entry \nof this order. Any motion fo r leave to amend must include a copy of the proposed \namended complaint, a redline version showing change s from the or iginal complaint, Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 7 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n \nand a brief o f no more than five (5) pages explain ing how the proposed amended \ncomplaint cures the deficiencies identified in this opinion.  \n \n \n \nENTERED : \n         \n        _____________________________  \n        Honorable Thomas M.

The plaintiffs allege that co-defendants, including ePayments Systems Ltd. (EPS), were involved in the fraudulent scheme. The court dismissed the case against EPS, citing a lack of personal jurisdiction since EPS's alleged involvement didn't demonstrate purposeful activities in Florida and failed to establish a concrete connection to the fraud conspiracy within the state. AI is involved here as the allure for the platform's forex operations, claimed to be powered by AI, which was allegedly part of the fraudulent representation to investors.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida has personal jurisdiction over ePayments Systems Ltd., a UK-based entity, based on its alleged involvement in RoFx.net’s fraudulent scheme.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it lacks personal jurisdiction over EPS, concluding that the plaintiffs failed to establish sufficient facts showing EPS engaged in activities purposefully directed at Florida, or that EPS was a co-conspirator in actions that had a nexus to Florida.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you are playing a game of tag, and someone from far away gets accused of cheating in the game.

(“EPS”). (ECF No. 94.) The Plaintiffs are a group of investors who say they were defrauded by a web of actors tied to RoFx.net (“RoFx”). RoFx, they say, held itself out to be a foreign exchange platform motored by artificial intelligence that turned out to be nothing more than a sham. The Defendants are over forty individuals and entities said to be part of RoFx’s scheme. \nAmong them is EPS, a money transmitter based out of the United \nKingdom. (See Am. Compl. ¶ 133, ECF No. 64.) RoFx paid EPS a fee for receiving certain deposits as “directed by the RoFx Operators.” ( Id. at ¶¶ 133-\n39). The Plaintiffs assert seven counts against EPS: (1) RICO enterprise under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c); (2) RICO conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d); (3) conspiracy to commit fraud; (4) aiding and abetting fraud; (5) conspiracy to commit conversion; (6) aiding and abetting conversion; and (7) unjust enrichment\n.  \nEPS challenges the Plaintiffs’ amended complaint on multiple grounds \nbut most importantly argues that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). The Court agrees and grants EPS’s motion on that basis. (ECF No. 94.)  \n1. Legal Standard\n“A plaintiff seeking the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a \nnonresident defendant bears the initial burden of alleging in the complaint \nsufficient facts to make out a prima facie case of jurisdiction.” United Techs.

A federal court’s exercise \nof personal jurisdiction must: “(1) be appropriate under the state long-arm statute and (2) not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment[.]” Id.  Case 1:21-cv-23472-RNS   Document 140   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2022   Page 1 of 5 \n2. Florida’s Long-Arm Statute \nThe Plaintiffs say the Court has personal jurisdiction over EPS pursuant \nto Florida Statutes § 48.193(1)(a)(2). (Opp. 4, ECF No. 5.) That provision does \nnot require the “tortfeasor’s physical presence in Florida[.]” Horizon Aggressive Growth, L.P. v. Roths tein-Kass, P.A., 421 F.3d 1162, 1168 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(cleaned up). In conspiracy cases, it “can support personal jurisdiction over any alleged conspirator where any other co-conspirator commits an act in Florida in furtherance of the conspiracy, even if the defendant over whom personal jurisdiction is sought individually committed no act in, or had no relevant contact with, Florida.” Mazer, 556 F.3d at 1281-82.  \nFor the Court to assert personal jurisdiction on such grounds, though, \nthe Plaintiffs must allege viable facts from which the Court can reasonably infer that EPS was a co-conspirator. In other words, that EPS entered into a “conspiracy either engineered in Florida or [one] pursuant to which a tortious act in furtherance was committed in Florida.” See id.  at 1283.  \nThey do not. According to the Plaintiffs, EPS “would receive funds from \nRoFx customers and route the illicit funds as directed by the RoFx Operators—with little or no scrutiny. In return, [EPS] would receive an ‘affiliate fee.’” (Am. Compl. ¶ 135.) The crux of EPS’s involvement seems to be that it “received funds from RoFx customers totaling at least €34,997 and $7,500 among 11 \ntransactions.” ( Id. ¶¶ 137-38, 203.b.) These statements do not allow a \nreasonable inference that EPS conspired with RoFx. Although RoFx may have used EPS to further its own aims, the amended complaint falls short of establishing that EPS played a “conscious role” within RoFx’s conspiracy by “agree[ing] to conceal the flow of illicit proceeds from the RoFx Scheme.” (Opp. 5.) \nThe Eleventh Circuit’s analysis in Mazer is instructive. 556 F.3d at 1282. \nThere, the court found that personal jurisdiction was not warranted over a foreign corporation accused of stealing a competitor’s corporate records. Id. The \nMazer plaintiff pointed to the fact that the foreign corporation’s managing director traveled to Florida during the time period in which the corporate records were stolen. Id.  Citing this overlap in time, the plaintiff posited that the \nforeign corporation’s managing director was involved in a conspiracy to steal the records. Id. However, the Eleventh Circuit found that this theory “require[d] \ntoo great a speculative leap.” Id. In fact, it noted that the complaint could yield \n“other inferences,” as can the amended complaint here. \nAlthough the Plaintiffs say their amended complaint details “EPS’s \nconscious role” within RoFx’s scheme (Opp. 5), it does not. (See Am. Compl.  Case 1:21-cv-23472-RNS   Document 140   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2022   Page 2 of 5¶¶ 128-29, 135-39, 229.) The amended complaint merely spells out the \nmultiple ways in which RoFx used EPS. Beyond the points discussed above, the Plaintiffs also point the Court to paragraph 229 of the amended complaint, where they say that Plaintiff Roman Leonov received an email from RoFx operators representing EPS to be its “brokerage subdivision.” (Am. Compl. ¶ 229.) But again, this only avers how RoFx used EPS. \nThe fact of the matter is that the Plaintiffs ask the Court to make an \ninferential leap as to EPS’s awareness of its role in RoFx’s scheme. The Plaintiffs point to the fact that RoFx used a shell entity to wire funds to EPS after RoFx customers forwarded funds to it individually. ( Id. ¶¶ 137-39.) This, \nthey say, is proof that EPS “knew its role receiving customer funds [would be] redundant and unnecessary if the transactions were [actually] legitimate, and that EPS was being paid merely to obfuscate the flow of funds for illicit transactions.” (Opp. 12.) The Plaintiffs also cite to “EPS’s apparent cessation of performing money laundering transactions in or around July 2019, [which] timed concurrently with RoFx Operators’ activation of [additional shell companies.]” ( Id.) Additionally, they point to the fact that the United Kingdom \nControl Authority suspended EPS for lapses in its anti-money laundering systems. ( Id. at 3.) Taken together, these points certainly could indicate a \nconspiracy but concluding that they should be seen together requires an inferential leap too far.  \nConclusory allegations concerning the existence of a conspiracy are \n“insufficient to establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction[.]” Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., 450 F.3d 1314, 1318 (11th Cir. 2006). The Plaintiffs’ factual allegations do not raise a reasonable inference that EPS was in cahoots with RoFx. The allegations instead much more readily allow for the reasonable inference that RoFx exploited EPS to further its purported scheme. To be sure, EPS was a money transmitter that advertised itself to businesses generally. (Am. Compl. ¶ 133.)  The fact that EPS charged RoFx a fee for its services is proof of a business relationship, not a conspiracy. Against this backdrop, the Plaintiffs cannot rely on EPS’ purported participation in a conspiracy with RoFx as the basis for personal jurisdiction under Section 48.193(1)(a)(2). \nThe Plaintiffs also rely on Horizon, 421 F.3d 1162, to argue that personal \njurisdiction is appropriate because EPS produced an injury in Florida. (Opp. 5, \n6.) In that decision, the Eleventh Circuit found that Florida courts recognize \npersonal jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants that “produce an injury in \nFlorida.” Horizon, 421 F.3d at 1168. It upheld personal jurisdiction “over an out-of-state auditing company that  .  .  .  telephonically contacted a Florida-based partnership and electronically accessed its computer files.” Id. at 1164. \nThat ruling involved factors not present here: first , the existence of these out-Case 1:21-cv-23472-RNS   Document 140   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2022   Page 3 of 5of-state communications geared toward Florida, and second, a “connexity” \nbetween the out-of-state communication and the cause of action itself “such that the cause of action would depend upon proof of either the existence or the content of any of the communications into Florida.” See i d. at 1168 (cleaned \nup). Absent such communications geared toward Florida and any “connexity” between those communications and the Plaintiffs’ cause of action against EPS, the Court finds the Plaintiffs’ reliance on Horizon unavailing. Accordingly, \npersonal jurisdiction under Florida’s long-arm statute fails. \n3. Due Process Under the Fourteenth Amendment \nThe Court’s assertion of personal jurisdiction over EPS would also not \ncomport with the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The Eleventh Circuit applies a three-part test when analyzing whether an exercise of specific jurisdiction comports with due process. It considers: “(1) whether the plaintiff's claims arise out of or relate to at least one of the defendant's contacts with the forum; (2) whether the nonresident defendant purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state, thus invoking the benefit of the forum state’s laws; and (3) whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.” Tavakoli v. Doronin, No. 18-21592-CIV, 2019 WL 1242669, at *10 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 18, 2019) (Altonaga, J.) (citing Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Mosseri , \n736 F.3d 1339, 1355 (11th Cir. 2013) (cleaned up)).  \nAbsent from the amended complaint is any mention of particular \ninstances in which EPS purposefully targeted Florida consumers, communicated with persons in Florida, or otherwise “purposefully availed” itself of the privilege of conducting business in the state. The Plaintiffs mention EPS’ direct receipt of client funds but they do not specify if any such clients were Florida-based. (See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 137-38.) Although the Plaintiffs rely on Tavakoli  to impute others’ Florida contacts onto EPS, the Court finds that case \ndistinguishable. There, unlike here, the plaintiffs pled the relevant defendant’s participation in concrete events that took place in Florida to further a conspiracy. See Tavakoli , 2019 WL 1242669 at *10 (“Eliasch traveled to Miami \nfor the April 22, 2014 Board meeting, stayed with Doronin at his Miami residence for three to four days around the date of the meeting, had dinner with Doronin in Miami to discuss matters related to Aman Resorts prior to the \nmeeting, and then participated in the PHRGL Board meeting in Miami.”)  \nThe Tavokoli  court imputed the above defendant’s Florida onto a foreign \nco-defendant corporate entity that had no Florida contacts of its own. See id. at \n*11-*12. But importantly, there was an immediate connection between the \ncorporate entity and the defendant with the Florida contacts—he owned 100% Case 1:21-cv-23472-RNS   Document 140   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/26/2022   Page 4 of 5of it. See Tavakoli , 2019 WL 1242669 at *3. By contrast, RoFx and EPS are \nseparate entities. Nowhere does the amended complaint allege the existence of \nFlorida contacts undertaken by any of EPS’s principals to allow for the sort of \nimputed contacts found in Tavakoli . Thus, the Plaintiffs fail to show how EPS \n“purposefully availed” itself of Florida either directly or imputably.  \nLast, the Plaintiffs suggest that the Court should invoke Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 4(k)(2) as a basis for asserting personal jurisdiction over EPS. \n“But courts rarely invoke jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2).” Noble House, LLC v. \nUnderwrit ers at Lloyd’s, London, 2021 WL 896219, at *5 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 3, \n2021) (Singhal, J.). Further, the Plaintiffs have not put forth any evidence that \nEPS “is not subject to jurisdiction in any state’s courts of general jurisdiction,” \nwhich is required to invoke the rule. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2)(A).   \nAccordingly, the Court grants EPS’s motion (ECF No. 94) for want of \npersonal jurisdiction.  \nDone \nand ordered at Miami, Florida, on May 26, 2022. \n________________________________ \nRobert N.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion grants final approval for a class action settlement between plaintiffs, who operated vehicles equipped with Lytx DriveCam systems, and defendants Maverick Transportation LLC and Lytx, Inc. The case involves allegations that Lytx used machine vision and artificial intelligence (AI) in its DriveCam devices to predict distracted driving behaviors, collecting and storing biometric data without consent, in violation of Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The settlement includes a $4.25 million fund to compensate class members and provides for attorneys' fees and service awards to class representatives.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether Lytx violated BIPA by using its AI-enabled DriveCam devices to collect and store biometric data of drivers without their consent.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the class action settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate, certifying the settlement class and ordering that the agreed terms and conditions be implemented, including monetary compensation from the settlement fund and dismissal of the action with prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company put cameras in vehicles that could tell when drivers weren't paying attention. This tech used computer smarts, like a brain, to do this without asking permission to use people's face data. People sued, saying this wasn't right. The company agreed to pay a lot of money to make up for it and promise to follow better rules. The judge said this was a good idea, and now the deal is official.",

(Doc. 132). The Motion re ferences and incorporates a \nClass Action Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement” or “Set tlement Agreement”) \n(Doc. 125) that, together  with the attached exhibits, sets  forth the terms and conditions \nfor the settlement of claims, on a class-wide  basis, between Plaintiffs Joshua Lewis, \nNathaniel Timmons, and James Cavanaugh (“Plai ntiffs”), individually and on behalf of \nthe Settlement Class, and Defendant Lytx, In c. (“Lytx” or “Defendant,” and, along with \nPlaintiffs, the “Parties”). \nHaving carefully considered the Motion, the Settlement Agreement together with \nits exhibits and attachments, the record in this matter, and all the files, records, and \nproceedings herein, including arguments set forth at the Final Approval Hearing on the Settlement, the Court ORDERS  as follows: Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 1 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 2 of 9 \n 1. This Final Approval Order (“Order”) incorporates by reference the \ndefinitions in the Settlement Agreement (Doc. 125). All term s defined in the Settlement \nAgreement shall have the same meaning in this Order. \n2. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Action pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1332(d).  \nCERTIFICATION OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS  \n3. The Court preliminarily certified the Settlement Class in its Preliminary \nApproval Order. (Doc. 126). \n4. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), (b)(3), and (e), and solely \nfor purposes of settl ement, the Court certifies of th e following Settlement Class: \nAll individuals who, while present in the State of Illinois, operated a \nvehicle equipped with a Lytx  DriveCam® Event Recorder \n(“DriveCam”) and for whom machine vision and artificial \nintelligence (“MV+AI”) was used to predict distracted driving \nbehaviors between October 12, 2016, and January 1, 2025.  \n5. For settlement purposes only, the Court confirms the appointment of \nPlaintiffs Joshua Lewis, Nathaniel Ti mmons, and James Cavanaugh as Class \nRepresentatives of the Settlement Class, and finds that they have adequately represented \nthe Settlement Class. \n6. For settlement purposes only, the Court confirms the appointment of the \nfollowing law firms as Class Counsel, and find s they are experienced in class litigation \nand have adequately represented the Settlement Class:  Carney Bates & Pulliam PLLC; \nLieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP; Milberg Coleman Bryson Phillips Grossman \nPLLC; Fish Potter Bolanos, P.C.; and Werman Salas P.C.

For settlement purposes only, the Court finds that the requirements of \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3 ) are satisfied for the following reasons:  \n(1) the Settlement Class is so numerous that  joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of la w and fact common to members of the Settlement Class that \npredominate over questions affecting only individual members ( e.g., whether Lytx \ncollected and stored Settlemen t Class Members’ biometric data, without consent, through \ndash cam devices in a manner that violat ed BIPA, and whether Plaintiffs and the \nSettlement Class Members are entitled to uniform statutory damages under BIPA); \n(3) Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims  of the Settlement Class; (4) Plaintiffs and \nClass Counsel have and will continue to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nSettlement Class; and (5) a class action is a superior method of fairly and efficiently \nadjudicating this Action.  \nFINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AND NOTICE PROGRAM  \n8. The Court approves the Settlement as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the \nbest interests of the Settlement Class Member s. The Court has specif ically considered the \nfactors relevant to class settlement approv al pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(e)(2), including whether: \n(A) the Class Representatives and Cla ss Counsel have adequately \nrepresented the Settlement Class; \n \n(B) the Settlement was negotiated at arm’s length;  (C) the relief provided for the Settlem ent Class is adequate, taking into \naccount (i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; (ii) the terms \nof any proposed award of attorn eys’ fees and costs, and Class \nRepresentative service award, including the timing of payment and Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 3 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 4 of 9 \n any justification for the awards; an d (iii) any agreement required to \nbe identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and  \n \n(D) the Settlement treats Settlement Class Members equitably relative to \neach other. \n \nThe Court has also considered other factors relevant to class settlement approval, \nincluding, inter alia , “(1) the strength of the case for plaintiffs on the merits, balanced \nagainst the extent of settlement offer; (2) the complexity, length, and expense of further \nlitigation; (3) the amount of opposition to the settlement; (4) the reaction of members of \nthe class to the settlement; (5) the opinion of competent counsel; and (6) stage of the \nproceedings and th e amount of discovery completed.” See Wong v. Accretive Health, Inc.,  \n773 F.3d 859, 863 (7th Cir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). \n9. Having considered the terms of the Settlement and the record before it, the \nCourt finds that the Class Representati ves and Class Counsel have adequately \nrepresented the interests of Settlement Class Members; the settlement consideration \nprovided under the Settlement constitutes fair value given in exchange  for the release of \nthe Released Claims against th e Released Parties; the Settlem ent is the result of arm’s-\nlength negotiations by experienced, well-q ualified counsel that included a day-long \nmediation conducted by a neutral mediator ; the Settlement provides meaningful \nmonetary benefits ( i.e. a $4,250,000 non-reversionary settlem ent fund (the “Settlement \nFund”)) to Settlement Class Members, and such benefits are not disproportionate to the \nattorneys’ fees and expenses  sought by Class Counsel; the benefits provided treat \nSettlement Class Members equitably; and the Settlement is reasonab le and appropriate \nunder the circumstances of this Action, including the risks, complexity, expense and Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 4 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 5 of 9 \n duration of the Action, as well as the reaction of the Settlement Class. The Court further \nfinds that there is no evidence of collusion in connection with the Settlement Agreement, \nimplicit or otherwise. \n10. The Court finds that the notice program as set forth in the Settlement \nAgreement and effectuated pursuant to the Preliminary Approval Order satisfies the \nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2) and due process and constitutes \nthe best notice practicable under the circumstances and shall constitute due and sufficient \nnotice to the Settlement Class of (a) the nature of the case; (b) the terms of the Settlement, \nincluding the definition of the Settlement Cl ass; (c) the class claims and issues; (d) the \nprocedure for objecting to or opting out of the Settlement; (e) that the Court will exclude \nfrom the Settlement Class any Settlement Cl ass member who timely and validly requests \nexclusion; (f) the time and manner for requesting such exclusion; (g) contact information \nfor Class Counsel, the Settlement Administrato r, the Settlement Website, and a toll-free \nnumber to ask questions about the Settlement; (h) important dates in the settlement \napproval process, including the deadlines to request exclusion or object and the date of \nthe Final Approval Hearing; (i) Class Coun sel’s request for an award of reasonable \nattorneys’ fees and expenses; (j) the Class Representatives’ application for a service \naward; and (k) the binding effect of a cla ss judgment on Settlement Class members under \nRule 23(c)(3). \n11. The Court reaffirms its appointment of the Settlement Administrator to \nperform the functions and duties of notice and settlement administration as set forth in \nthe Settlement Agreement and to provide such other administration services as are Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 5 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 6 of 9 \n reasonably necessary to facilitate the comple tion of the Settlement. Accordingly, Class \nCounsel and the Settlement Administrator are directed to administer the Settlement in \naccordance with its terms and provisions. \n12. The Court notes, moreover, that no objections or opt-outs were filed in \nconnection with the Settlement. \n13. The Court APPROVES  the Settlement in all respects and orders that the \nSettlement Agreement be consummated and im plemented in accordance with its terms \nand conditions. \n14. The Parties, without further approval from the Court, are authorized to \nagree and adopt such amendments, modifica tions, and expansions of the Settlement \nAgreement and its implementing  documents (including all exhibits to the Settlement \nAgreement) so long as they ar e consistent in all material re spects with this Order and do \nnot limit the rights of Settlement Class Members. \n15. The Court shall retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction to resolve any \ndisputes or challenges that may arise in  connection with the Settlement Agreement, \nincluding any challenge to the performance,  validity, interpreta tion, administration, \nenforcement, or enforc eability of the Notice, this Order, or the Settlement Agreement. \n16. In the event that this Order is revers ed on appeal or otherwise does not \nbecome final, (i) this Order shall be rendered null and void and shall be vacated nunc pro \ntunc, (ii) the Settlement Agreement and other related orders shall be rendered null and \nvoid and shall be vacated nunc pro tunc , (iii) the Settlement Fund shall be refunded to the \nDefendant, less settlement administrative expenses actually incurred and paid, and Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 6 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 7 of 9 \n (iv) the Action shall proceed as if no settlement had occurre d and as otherwise provided \nfor in the Settlem ent Agreement. \n17. Neither the Settlement Agreement, th e Settlement contained therein, the \nnegotiation nor any proceeding or document executed pursuant to or in furtherance \nthereof, (i) is or shall be construed as, an admission of, or evidence of, the truth of any \nallegation or of any liability or the validity of  any claim or defense, in whole or in part, \non the part of any party in any respect, or (ii) is or shall be admissible in any action or \nproceeding for any reason, other than an action or proceeding to enforce the terms of the \nSettlement or this Order. \nDISMISSAL AND FINAL JUDGMENT \n18. Upon issuance of Final Judgment in this case, the Action will be dismissed \nwith prejudice, with each party to bear its own costs. \n19. Upon the Effective Date and by operation of this Order, the Releasing \nParties (including Plaintiffs and those Settlement Class Members who do not timely \nexclude themselves from the Settlement Class), and each of  them, shall be deemed to \nhave, and by operation of the Final Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever \nreleased, relinquished, and discharged all Rele ased Claims against th e Released Parties. \nFurther, upon the Effective Date, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each \nSettlement Class Member, shall, either direct ly, indirectly, representatively, or in any \ncapacity, be permanently barred and enjoined from filing, commencing, prosecuting, \ncontinuing, pursuing, intervening in, or partic ipating (as a class member or otherwise) in \nany lawsuit, action, or other proceeding in an y jurisdiction (other than participation in Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 7 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 8 of 9 \n the Settlement) against any Released Party based on the Released Claims. \n20. Upon the Effective Date and by operat ion of this Order and Final Judgment, \nthe Settlement Agreement will be binding on and will have res judicata  and preclusive \neffect in all pending and future lawsuits or ot her proceedings maintained by or on behalf \nof Plaintiffs and the Releasing Parties. \n21. The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiffs’ unopposed Motion for Final Approval \nof Class Action Se ttlement (Doc. 132). \n22. This Court directs entry of this Order and Final Judgment pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 based upon the Court’s finding that there is no just \nreason for delay of enforcemen t or appeal of this Final Judgment. The Clerk of the Court \nshall close the file in this matter.  \nATTORNEYS’ FEES, LITIGATION EXPENSES, AND SERVICE AWARDS \n23. The Court also has consid ered Plaintiffs’ Motion  for Attorneys’ Fees, \nLitigation Expenses, and Service Awards (D oc. 128), the supporting memorandum of law \n(Doc. 129), and the declaration of Class Counse l (Doc. 130). The Court finds, based on its \nreview of the relevant submissions, that (i) the payment of attorneys’ fees in the amount \nof one-third of the Settle ment Fund, or $1,416,666.67, and (ii) the reimbursem ent of out-\nof-pocket litigation expenses  in the amount of $63,495.79 are reasonable under Rule 23. \nSuch payment shall be made pursuant to and in the manner provided by the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement. \n24. The Court further finds that the reques ted service awards to each of the \nthree Class Representatives are fair and reasonable. As such, the Court approves a service Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 8 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 9 of 9award to each Class Representative in the amount of $10,000, to be paid from the \nSettlement Fund in the manner set forth in the Settlement Agreement.\n25. The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiffs’ counsel’s unopposed Motion for \nAttorneys’ Fees, Litigation Expens es, and Service Awards (Doc. 128).\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDATED:  July 25, 2025\n____________________________\nNANCY J.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\nThis court case involves a civil rights complaint filed by Lindsay Spilsbury against Carice, Seth, and Vera Demchok. Spilsbury alleges that the defendants exploited her using artificial intelligence by creating an account in her name on an online gaming platform and selling her identity on the dark web, among other claims. The court granted Spilsbury's request to proceed without prepaying fees but ordered her to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for failing to state a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and potential jurisdictional issues due to related state court proceedings.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe primary legal issue is whether Spilsbury’s complaint sufficiently alleges a violation of her federally protected rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by the defendants acting under the color of state law, and whether the court has jurisdiction considering ongoing related state court proceedings.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court granted Spilsbury's application to proceed in forma pauperis but ordered her to amend her complaint to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for failing to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and for being barred by the Younger abstention and Rooker-Feldman doctrines. The court gave her 21 days to respond with an amended complaint that addresses these issues.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine someone is trying to sue some people because they think they were wronged, but they don't have enough money to pay the court fees. The court allowed this person to proceed without paying up front. However, the court isn't sure if it can actually handle the case, partly because another similar case might already be happening in a different court. The person has to explain more about their case to convince the court why it should be the one to deal with it. If not, the case could be thrown out. In this situation, she also claims that some technology, like robots or AI, was used to cause her harm, but she needs to clarify her story and how exactly the law was broken.",

No. 2:25-cv-00646-KRS CARICE DEMCHOK, \nSETH DEMCHOK and VERA DEMCHOK, \n  Defendants. \nORDER GRANTING APPLICATION TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS  \nAND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \n \n THIS MATTER  comes before the Court on pro se  Plaintiff’s Civil Rights Complaint \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“ Complaint”), (Doc. 1), file d July 9, 2025, and Plaintiff’s \nApplication to Proceed in District Court Without Prepaying Fees or Costs (“Application”), (Doc. \n2), filed July 9, 2025. \nI. APPLICATION TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS  \n The statute for proceedings in forma pauperis , 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a), provides that the Court \nmay authorize the commencement of any suit without  prepayment of fees by a person who submits \nan affidavit that includes a stat ement of all assets the person posse sses and that the person is unable \nto pay such fees.  \nWhen a district court receives an applica tion for leave to proceed  in forma pauperis, \nit should examine the papers and determine if the requirements of [28 U.S.C.] § 1915(a) are satisfied. If they are, leave should be granted. Thereafter, \nif the court finds that the allegations of  poverty are untrue or that the action is \nfrivolous or malicious, it  may dismiss the case[.] \n \nMenefee v. Werholtz , 368 Fed.Appx. 879, 884 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing Ragan v. Cox , 305 F.2d 58, \n60 (10th Cir. 1962). “The statute [allowing a litig ant to proceed in form a pauperis] was intended Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 1 of 62 \n for the benefit of those too poor to pay or give security for costs....” Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de \nNemours & Co.,  335 U.S. 331, 344 (1948). While a litigant n eed not be “absolutely destitute,” “an \naffidavit is sufficient which states that one canno t because of his poverty pa y or give security for \nthe costs and still be able to provide himsel f and dependents with th e necessities of life.” Id. at \n339.   The Court grants Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed in District Court Without Prepaying \nFees or Costs. Plaintiff signed an affidavit st ating she is unable to pay the costs of these \nproceedings and provided the following information:  (i) Plaintiff’s average monthly income during \nthe past 12 months is $2,600.00; (i i) Plaintiff has $600.00 in a bank acc ount; (iii) Plaintiff has three \nsons who rely on her for support; and (iv) Plaintiff states: “I have limited income temporary support \nto survive.”\n1 The Court finds that Plaintiff is unable to  pay the costs of this proceeding because \nPlaintiff signed an affidavit stating she is unable to pay the costs of these proceedings and Plaintiff \nhas three sons who re ly on her for support. \nII. ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \n Plaintiff filed her Complaint using the form “Civil Rights Complaint Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” Where the Complaint form prompt s plaintiffs to indica te whether defendants \nwere acting under color of state la w, Plaintiff marked the “Yes” box. See Complaint at 1, 3. Plaintiff \nalleges Defendants have opened an account on the online gaming platform “Steam” using her \nname, stalk her using a fl ying aircraft, have used robots and artificial intelligence to exploit \nPlaintiff, and sold Plaintiff’s identity to the dark web. See Complaint at 2-12.  \nThe Complaint fails to state claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. “The two elements of a \nSection 1983 claim are (1) depriv ation of a federally protected right by (2) an actor acting under \n \n1 Plaintiff states her monthly expenses include $300.00 for rent and $300.00 for a rental car but did not state her \nmonthly amounts for utilities, food, clothing, medical and dental or other expenses. Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 2 of 63 \n color of state law.” Schaffer v. Salt Lake City Corp. , 814 F.3d 1151, 1155 (10th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff \nhas not alleged any facts showing that Defenda nts were acting under color of state law.  \n Plaintiff states she has begun other lawsuits in the Third Judicial District Court dealing \nwith the same facts in volved in this action. See Complaint at 13. It appe ars the Court may lack \njurisdiction over this case pursuant to the Younger  abstention doctrine and/or the Rooker-Feldman  \ndoctrine due to the st ate court proceedings. \nThe Younger  abstention doctrine “dictate s that federal courts not interfere with state court \nproceedings . . . when such relief could adeq uately be sought before the state court.” Rienhardt v. \nKelly , 164 F.3d 1296, 1302 (10th Cir. 1999); D.L. v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 497 , 392 F.3d 1223, \n1228 (10th Cir. 2004) (“ Younger  abstention is jurisdictional”) (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a \nBetter Env. , 523 U.S. 83, 100 n.3 (1998)). In determining whether Younger  abstention is \nappropriate, the Court considers whether: \n(1) there is an ongoing state . . . civil . . . proceeding, (2) the state court provides an \nadequate forum to hear the claims raised in the federal complaint, and (3) the state \nproceedings involve important state intere sts, matters which traditionally look to \nstate law for their resolution or implicate separately articulated state policies. Younger  abstention is non-discretionary; it  must be invoked once the three \nconditions are met, absent ex traordinary circumstances.  \n \nAmanatullah v. Colo. Bd. of Med. Exam’rs , 187 F.3d 1160, 1163 (10th Cir. 1999) (citations \nomitted).  \nThe Rooker-Feldman  doctrine:  \nbars federal district cour ts from hearing cases “br ought by state-co urt losers \ncomplaining of injuries caused by state-c ourt judgments rendered before the district \ncourt proceedings commenced and inviting di strict court review and rejection of \nthose judgments.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp. , 544 U.S. 280, \n284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). Wh ere the relief requested would \nnecessarily undo the stat e court’s judgment, Rooker-Feldman  deprives the district \ncourt of jurisdiction. Mo’s Express, 441 F.3d at 1237.

De Grandy , 512 U.S. 997, 1005-06 (1994)). \nAs the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of  this Court, Plaintiff bears the burden of \nalleging facts that s upport jurisdiction. See Dutcher v. Matheson , 733 F.3d 980, 985 (10th Cir. \n2013) (“Since federal courts are courts of limite d jurisdiction, we presume no jurisdiction exists \nabsent an adequate showing by the party invoking federal jurisdiction”); Evitt v. Durland , 243 F.3d \n388, at *2 (10th Cir. 2000) (“even if  the parties do not raise the que stion themselves, it is our duty \nto address the apparent lack of  jurisdiction sua sponte”) (quoting Tuck v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n,  \n859 F.2d 842, 843 (10th Cir.1988).    The Court orders Plaintiff to show cause  why the Court should not dismiss this case \npursuant to Younger  and/or Rooker-Feldman and for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. If Plaintiff asserts the Court should not dismiss this case, Pl aintiff must file an \namended complaint that states a claim upon which re lief can be granted and that shows that this \ncase is not barred by Younger  and/or Rooker-Feldman . Plaintiff must identify each case in state \ncourt dealing with the same facts involved in this  action including the name of the courts and the \ncase numbers. Plaintiff must also indicate whethe r the state court proceeding is ongoing, has been \ndismissed and whether Plaintiff has appealed any final judgment in the st ate court proceeding. The \namended complaint must comply with the Federa l and Local Rules of Civil Procedure and must \nstate a claim over which th e Court has jurisdiction. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(b) (“A party must state \nits claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs”); Nasious v. Two Unknown B.I.C.E.

III. NOTICE OF CASE MANAGEMENT \nGenerally, pro se  litigants are held to the same standards of professional \nresponsibility as traine d attorneys. It is a pro se  litigant’s responsibility to become \nfamiliar with and to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  and the Local \nRules of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico  (the “Local \nRules”).  \nGuide for Pro Se Litigants at 4, United States Di strict Court, District of New Mexico (October \n2022).

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) (“If the plaintiff \nfails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss \nthe action”); Gustafson v. Luke , 696 Fed.Appx. 352, 354 (10th Cir. 2017) (“Although the language \nof Rule 41(b) requires that th e defendant file a motion to di smiss, the Rule  has long been \ninterpreted to permit cour ts to dismiss actions sua  sponte for a plaintiff’s failure to prosecute or \ncomply with the rules of civil proc edure or court’s orders.”) (quoting Olsen v. Mapes , 333 F.3d \n1199, 1204 n.3 (10th Cir. 2003)). IV. COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 11  \nThe Court reminds Plaintiff of her obligations pu rsuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. See Yang v. Archuleta , 525 F.3d 925, 927 n. 1 (10th Cir. 2008) (“ Pro se  status Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 5 of 66 \n does not excuse the obligation of any litigant to comply with the fundament al requirements of the \nFederal Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure.”). Rule 11(b) provides: \nRepresentations to the Court.  By presenting to the court a pleading, written \nmotion, or other paper--whether by signi ng, filing, submitting, or later advocating \nit--an attorney or unrepresent ed party certifies that to  the best of the person’s \nknowledge, information, and belief, formed  after an inquiry reasonable under the \ncircumstances:  (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause \nunnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;  (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal c ontentions are warranted by existing law \nor by a nonfrivolous argument for extendi ng, modifying, or reversing existing law \nor for establishing new law;  (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, \nwill likely have evidentiary support afte r a reasonable opportunity for further \ninvestigation or discovery; and  (4) the denials of factual contentions ar e warranted on the evidence or, if \nspecifically so identified, are reasonably ba sed on belief or a la ck of information. \n \nFed.

Summary: In the case, Clarence Risher filed a class-action lawsuit against Adecco, Inc. and Locutus, Inc., claiming they violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by sending unsolicited text messages using an AI-operated chatbot named Mya. The court dismissed Risher's claims about an autodialer and the metaphorical use of \"voice\" for text messages, aligning with the Supreme Court’s decision limiting the scope of autodialers and defining texts as not falling within the TCPA’s provision on artificial or prerecorded voice.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the unsolicited text messages sent by the AI chatbot Mya fall under the TCPA's prohibition on calls made using an \"artificial or prerecorded voice.\"\n\n3.

INTRODUCTION  \n In this putative class action, plaintiff Clarence Risher alleges defendants Adecco, Inc. and \nLocutus, Inc. (formerly Mya Systems, Inc. ) violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 \nU.S.C. § 227 (“TCPA”) by sending text messages to his cell phone, soliciting him for possible \nemployment through Adecco, which operates a job placement service. The operative fourth \namended complaint adva nces three claims for relief. The first claim  alleges defendants utilized an \nautomatic telephone dialing syste m. Risher concedes, however, that in light of the Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid , 141 S. Ct. 1163 (2021), which applied a more \nrestrictive construction of “autodialer,” his first claim for relief is not tenable and may be \ndismissed.  \n Defendants’ present motion does not challenge the second claim for relief, which asserts \ndefendants sent the text messages notwithstanding the fact that Risher’s telephone number was \nlisted on the National Do Not Call Registry.  The only question presented by the motion to dismiss, Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 1 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  therefore, is whether text messages fall within the provisions of the TCPA  prohibiting unsolicited \ncalls made using an “artificial or prerecorded voice.”    \n Risher also challenges a discovery order entered by the assigned magistra te judge. For the \nreasons below, the motion to dismiss will be granted, and the objection to the discovery ruling will \nbe overruled.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND  \n Risher alleges that in 2008  he submitted information to Adecco’s job placement services \nseeking employmen t in either a “data entry” position or as a “desktop support technician.” He was \nnot hired for either of those positions, and had no further contact with Adecco. Nearly 11 years \nlater,  however,  in 2019, Risher received a text message stating , “Hello Claren ce, this is Mya from \nAdecco. We’re hiring for Refurbisher roles, and I thought you might be interested. Do you have a \nminute to chat via text? You can also reply ‘no more texts’.” Risher ignored the message. Some \nhours later he received a further text mess age asking, “Hi Clarence! It’s Mya again. Are you free \nto chat for a few minutes?”  \n “Mya,” was not a human being, but a “chatbot” —a computer program  utilizing so -called \nartificial intelligence to  recognize a consumer’s responses and  lead a conversation wi th an \nindividual in natural language by mimicking a human.  Mya was developed and operated by \nLocutus, under a contractual relationship with Adecco.   \n \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD S \nA complaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the  \npleader is entitled to reli ef.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  While “detailed factual allegations” are not \nrequired, a complaint must have sufficient factual allegations to state a claim that is “plausible on \nits face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 ( 2009) (citing Bell Atl. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n555, 570 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that \nallows the court to  draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 2 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  alleged.”  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556). This standard asks for “more than a sheer \npossibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Id. The determination is a context -specific task \nrequiring the court “to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Id. at 679.   \n A motion to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure tests the legal sufficiency of the cl aims alleged in the complaint. See Conservation \nForce v. Salazar , 646 F.3d 1240, 1241 -42 (9th Cir. 2011). Dismiss al under Rule 12(b)(6) may be \nbased on either the “lack of a cognizable legal theory” or on “the absence of sufficient facts \nalleged under a cognizable legal theory.”  Id. at 1242 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). When evaluating such a moti on, the court must accept all material allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the non -moving party. In re \nQuality Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 865 F.3d 1130, 1140 (9th Cir. 2017).  \n As to Risher’s objection to the d iscovery order, a district court may modify a magistrate \njudge ’s ruling on a non -dispositive matter only if the order is “clearly erroneous” or “contrary to \nlaw.” 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A); Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a); Bahn v. NME Hospitals, Inc ., 929 F.2d 1404, \n1414 (9th Cir.1991).  \n \nIV.  DISCUSSION  \n A.  Motion to dismiss  \n In the absence of express consent, section 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the TCPA, and \nits implementing regulations at 47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(2), prohibit non -emergency calls to cell \nphone s that are made  “using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded \nvoice .” As noted, Risher agrees that his claim that defendants used an “automatic telephone \ndialing system” cannot go forward. Risher also acknowledges that the t ext messages sent to him \nwere not  a “voice” in the sense of audibl e, spoken , words. Risher contends, however, that the \nmessages had a “voice” in a metaphorical sense —indeed that the very intent of the Mya chatbot is \nto create the impression of an interacti ve human “voice,” responding conversationally. Risher \nfurther argues that the texts, although silent, represent the very type of automated, mass messaging Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 3 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that TCPA was intended to prevent.  \n Risher’s position is not frivolous. As one court observed, “ the p olicy of protecting \ntelephone privacy might be advanced by a prohibition on unwanted text messages . . . .” Mina v. \nRed Robin International, Inc ., Case No. 20 -cv-00612 -RM-KLM (August 18, 2022, D. Col.). As \nthe Mina  court went on to hold, however, “that is not what the TCPA currently does.” Rather, “in \ncommon parlance, text messages simply are not considered ‘voices,’” and the statute should be \nunderstood by the ordinary meaning of its words. Id.; see also , Soliman v. Subway Franchisee \nAdvertising Fund Trust , Ltd., Case No. 3:19 -cv-592 (July 18, 2022, D. Conn.) (“To be sure . . . \n‘voice’ can also be used metaphorically . . . [b]ut this use is less common and is typically used in \npoetic or literary settings . . . . In normal English, an advertiser’s text messa ge is not its ‘voice.’ ”) \n Soliman  further observed that interpreting “voice” metaphorically “is even less plausible \ngiven that the Act bans ‘prerecorded voices.’ To ‘record’ is ‘[t]o convert (sound or visual scenes, \nesp. television pictures) into permanent  form.’ Record (def. 9c), Oxford English Dictionary. This \ndefinition matches perfectly with the sound sense of ‘voice,’ but not with the metaphorical one.”  \n Risher’s third claim for relief, therefore, fails. Because this dismissal turns on the legal \nconcl usion that the text messages do not fall within the statutory language, it is not a pleading \ndefect  that can be cured by amending to state additional or other facts . Risher has not suggested \notherwise. Accordingly, no leave to amend will be granted.  \n  \n B.  Objection to discovery ruling  \n Risher contends that the magistrate judge has erroneously limited his ability to obtain \ncertain documents from defendants —(1) a representative sample of the dialing lists/logs showing \ntext recipients who may be class members, (2) data and records related to any consent defense, and \n(3) documents showing differences in the text messages. The crux of the dispute appears to be that  \ndefendants have produced only  information  “specific to the text message campaign through which \nPlaintiff received a text message,” whereas Risher wishes to represent “all individuals who were \nsent text messages through Mya’s chat bot promoting Adecco’s jo b placements,” which he insists Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 4 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  requires discovery into other “campaigns” or candidate lists.  \n The magistrate judge, however, has not permanently closed the door on Risher’s ability to \nobtain further discovery. Rather, in the order Risher challenges, the magistrate judge ruled that \ndefendants had adequately complied with her prior order, Risher’s assertions to the contrary  \nnotwithstanding. The judge then expressly ordered the parties to engage in further meet and confer \ndiscussions regarding, among other things, Risher’s “request for the total number of text \nrecipients.”  \n The order observed that th e parties had failed to “tet her their arguments to the Fourth \nAmended Complaint, ” and that those arguments provided “ no context that identifies the problem \nor suggests a solution. ” Risher’s objection to the ruling insists the magistrate judge failed to \ncond uct any analysis under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26. The record is clear, however, that the magistrate \njudge was appropriately focused on the questions of burden and relevance  as directed by that rule \nboth at the time of the order Risher challenges, and when issuing the  underlying prior order. \nIndeed, the magistrate judge was careful to avoid deciding issues where the parties had not \nprovided sufficient information and clarity to permit a proper Rule 26 analysis. In directing further \nmeet and confer negotiations, the ord er noted, “[i]t is not the court’s job to guess at relevance or \nburden.”  \n In short, Risher has failed to show that the magistrate judge’s ruling was clearly erroneous \nor contrary to law.  His objection is overruled.  \n \n  \n  \n  Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 5 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  V.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Clearview AI, Inc. Consumer Privacy Litigation, plaintiffs allege that Clearview AI violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by secretly collecting billions of facial images from the internet and using AI algorithms to create a biometric database. Macy’s is accused of using this database to identify individuals in surveillance footage without proper consent as required by BIPA. The court denied Macy’s motion to certify an interlocutory appeal challenging its previous ruling, finding that plaintiffs adequately alleged violations of their biometric privacy rights under BIPA, and that Macy's use of the database was potentially for profit, thus fitting within the claims under BIPA.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the actions of Macy’s in using Clearview AI’s biometric database without proper consent violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) and whether Macy’s had standing to appeal the district court's ruling on the alleged violations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that there was no contestable question of law to appeal and found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged concrete harm regarding their BIPA claims. Consequently, the court denied Macy's motion for an interlocutory appeal, as it did not meet the requirements under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company called Clearview collected photos from all over the internet to create a kind of facial recognition database using AI. Macy's, a retail store, used this database to identify people caught on their security cameras, but without asking those people for permission first. The court said this might be against the law that protects your private biometric information, like your facial features, unless you give permission. Macy's wanted to challenge this in court, but the judge said there's no good reason to let them appeal at this point because the original arguments that the people made were pretty solid according to previous cases. So, the court decided it's not worth an early appeal and will keep the case moving forward.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN DIVISION  \n \n       )   \nIn re Clearview AI, Inc. Consumer Privacy Litig.,  ) Case No. 21- cv-0135 \n       )   \n       ) Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman   \n       ) \n      \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n \nPlaintiffs brought a first amended consolidated class action complaint in this multi -district \nlitigation alleging claims against defendant retailer Macy’s Retail Holdings, LLC (“Macy’s”) under the \nIllinois Biometric Information Privacy A ct, 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”), along with claims under \nCalifornia and New York law.   On January 27, 2022, the Court granted in part and denied in part \nMacy’s motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) .  \nBefore the Court is Macy’s  motion to certify an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) \nchallenging certain aspects of the  Court’s J anuary 27  ruling.   For the following reasons, the Court , in its \ndiscretion,  denies Macy’s motion.  \nBackgroun d \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its prior rulings in this multi -district litigation , especially \nthe Court’s January 27, 2022 ruling .  Plaintiffs allege that the Clearview defendants covertly scraped \nbillions of photographs of facial images from the int ernet and then used artificial intelligence algorithms \nto scan the face geometry of each individual depicted in the photographs to harvest the individuals’ unique biometric identifiers and corresponding biometric information.  The Clearview defendants then created a searchable database containing plaintiffs’ biometrics that allowed users to identify unknown \nindividuals  by uploading a photograph to the database.   \nDefendant Macy’s is a private corporation that purchased access to the Clearview database and \nthe biometrics contained therein to identify people whose images appeared in surveillance camera Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 1 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n footage from Macy’s retail stores.   Plaintiffs allege that Macy’s is part of the Clearview Client Class, \nwhich they defined as follows:  \nAll non- governmental, pr ivate entities – including publicly -traded companies – who \npurchased access to, or otherwise obtained, the Biometric Database and then utilized \nthe database to run biometric searches at a time when the Biometrics of one or more of \nthe named Plaintiffs had already been captured, collected or obtained, and subsequently \nstored, by the Clearview Defendants . \n \nPlaintiffs contend that there are at least 200 companies in the Clearview Client Class.  \n \nIn their first amended consolidated complaint, plaintiffs bring a BIPA claim against Macy’s \nunder 740 ILCS 14/15(b), which prohibits private entities from collecting, capturing, purchasing, \nreceiving through trade, or otherwise obtaining a person’s biometric identifiers or information without first providing notice and consent.  P laintiffs also bring a BIPA claim under 740 ILCS 14/15(c), which \nprohibits private entities from selling, leasing, trading, or profiting from a person’s biometric identifiers or information.  Further, plaintiffs alle ged statutory and common law claims against Macy’s under \nCalifornia and New York law.  \nLegal Standard  \nThere are four statutory criteria the Court must consider  in order to grant  a § 1292(b) motion: \n(1) there must be a question of law; (2) the question of law must be controlling ; (3) the question of law \nmust be c ontestable ; and (4)  immediate appeal would materially advance the litigation .  Kenosha Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ. v. Whitaker,  841 F.3d 730, 732 ( 7th Cir. 2016) ; Ahrenholz v. Board of Trs. of \nUniv. of Ill., 219 F.3d 674, 675 (7th Cir. 2000) .  “Question of law ” in the context of § 1292(b) goes to \nthe “ meaning of a statutory or constitutional provision, regulation, or common law doctrine .”  \nAhrenholz, 219 F.3d at 676.    Section 1292(b) gives district courts discretion when considering whether \nto certify an interlocutory appeal.   See Breuder v. Board of Trs. of Cmty. College Dist. No. 502, 888 F.3d 266, \n271 (7th Cir. 2018).  In the end, § 1292(b) requests for interlocutory appeal are for exceptional circumstances .  Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis , 519 U.S. 61, 74, 117 S.Ct. 467, 136 L.Ed.2d 437 (1996) . \n Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 2 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n Discussion  \n In the present §  1292(b) motion, Macy’s asks the Court to certify three questions, the first one \nconcerning Article III standing:  “ Whether, in light of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in \nTransUnion , allegations of bare statutory violations of Illinois’ Biometric Inform ation Privacy Act, \nunaccompanied by allegations of actual harm, confer Article III standing .”  There are several reasons \nwhy Macy’s  first question for interlocutory appeal  does not meet §  1292(b)’s  standards , as discussed \ndirectly below.  \n In the  January 2022 ruling, the  Court concluded that “ plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that \ndefendant’s use of their private information without the opportunity to give their consent as required \nunder BIPA 15(b) caused them the concrete harm of violating thei r privacy interests in their biometric \ndata.”  In short, the Court concluded that there were sufficient allegations of actual harm, unlike Macy’s  \ninterlocutory question that there was no actual harm.   Macy’s first question thus distorts the Court’s \napplica tion of the law to the facts.    \nMeanwhile, in concluding plaintiffs sufficiently alleged actual harm  for their BIPA 15(b) claim , \nthe Court relied on the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Bryant v. Compass Group USA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, \n627 ( 7th Cir. 2020) .  In Bryant , the Seventh Circuit concluded that the plaintiff had Article III standing \nfor h er BIPA 15(b) claim based on the disclosure of her private information without her consent, and \nthus defendant “ inflicted  the concrete injury BIPA intended to protect against,  i.e. a consumer ’s loss of \nthe power and ability to make informed decisions about the collection, storage, and use of her \nbiometric information.”   Id. at 627.  The Supreme Court’s deci sion in TransUnion , LLC v. Ramirez , 141 \nS.Ct. 2190, 2200 (2021) , bolsters the Bryant  holding  when it held,  “[v]arious intangible harms can also be \nconcrete” including “reputational harms, disclosure of private information, and intrusion upon \nseclusion.”  Id.  at 2204.   \nNevertheless, Macy’s argues that T ransUnion  stands for the proposition that a victim of a privacy \nharm can only suffer an injury -in-fact for Article III standing  if the  victim’s  information is disseminated Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n to a third -party .  The TransUnion  decision does not support this proposition.  Instead, in the  context of \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the TransUnion  Court concluded that  certain  class members \nwhose credit reports were not disseminated to third parties did not suffer a concrete injury -in-fact, \nkeeping in mind that “history and tradition offer a meaningful guide to the types of cases that Article \nIII empowers federal courts to consider.”   Id. at 2204.  As the TransUnion  Court clarified , “with respect \nto the concrete -harm requirement in particular, this Court ’s opinion in Spokeo v. Robins  indicated that \ncourts should assess whether the alleged injury to the plaintiff has a ‘close relationship’ to a harm \n‘traditionally’ recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts” and that  this “inquiry \nasks whether plaintiffs have identified a close  historical  or common- law analogue for their asserted \ninjury.”  Id .  In TransUnion , the Supreme Court analogized the FCRA violations to the tort of \ndefamation , which requires that the defamatory statement be published to a third party.  Id . at 2209.  \nThus, the plaintiffs whose reports were not disseminated to third parties did not allege a concrete \ninjury -in-fact under the FCRA.  \nHere, the Seventh Circuit analogized  BIPA violations to common law privacy torts, which are \ndifferent common law torts than  defamation .  See Fox v. Dakkota Integrated Sys ., LLC,  980 F.3d 1146, \n1153 ( 7th Cir. 2020) ; Bryant , 958 F.3d at 627.  As the Bryant  court held:  “ Bryant was asserting a \nviolation of her own rights —her fingerprints, her private information—and that this is enough to show \ninjury -in-fact without further tangible consequences.   This was no bare procedural violation; it was an \ninvasion of her private domain, much like an act of trespass would be.  Id . at 624.  Accordingly, t he \nSupreme Court’s FCRA ruling in TransUnion  does not change the Seventh Circuit ’s BIPA  precedent.  \nIn the end, there is no contestable question of law  to appeal because under Seventh Circuit \nprecedent , a plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a BIPA 15(b) claim based on the harm associated with the \ninvasion of plaintiff’s private information.  See Bryant , 958 F.3d at 619 (“ a failure to follow section 15(b) \nof the law leads to an  invasion of personal rights that is both concrete  and particularized.” ).  Therefore, \nthe Court denies Macy’s motion in this respect.  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n Next, Macy’s seeks to certify the following question for interlocutory appeal:  “ Whether, as a \nmatter of law, a company’s use of a biometric database for loss prevention suffices to allege ‘ profit ’ \nunder Section 15(c) of BIPA. ”  To recap, a violation of BIPA 15(c) occurs when private entit ies “sell, \nlease, trade, or otherwise profit from a person ’s or a customer ’s biometric identifier or biometric \ninformation.”   Macy’s second question does not involve a question of law as required under §  1292(b) \nbecause the Court did not construe the statu tory meaning of “ profit ” under BIPA 15(c), which would \nhave amounted to a question of law for §  1292(b) purposes.  See Ahrenholz, 219 F.3d at 676; see, e.g., \nDrnek v. City of Chicago , 205 F.Supp.2d 894, 900 (N.D. Ill. 2002) (Bucklo, J.) .  Rather , the Court  \naddressed the parties’ arguments w hether plaintiffs  had plausibly alleged Macy’s profit ed from plaintiffs’ \nbiometric information.   \nTo explain, in the January 2022 ruling, the Cour t concluded that plaintiffs  plausibly alleged that  \nMacy’s used their biometric information for its own  business purposes and profited from its use .  From \nthese allegations, the Court stated that  “it is reasonable to infer that plaintiffs’ biometric information \nwas necessary to Macy ’s loss prevention business model and that this biometric information generated \nprofits by reducing the number of stolen goods. ”  Macy’s disagreement with how the Court applied the \nfacts as alleged to BIPA 15(c) is not grounds for an interlocutory appeal.  See 880 S. Rohlwing Road, LLC \nv. T&C Gymnastics, LLC , No. 16- cv-7650, 2017 WL 264504, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 19, 2017) (St. Eve, J.) \n(“If a mere disagreement in how the law is applied to the facts of a particular case was all that was \nneeded for an interlocutory appeal,” … “every single denial of a motion to dismiss would present \ngrounds for interlocutory appeal.”)  (citation omitted) .  The Court denies Macy’s motion in this respect.  \nLast, Macy’s asks the Court to certify a question in relation to plai ntiffs’ California and New \nYork claims, namely, “w hether California and New York statutes and common law protect the same set \nof rights secured by BIPA. ”  Specifically, Macy’s contends plaintiffs are trying to extend BIPA to other \nstates.  In making this argument, Macy’s ignores the Cour t’s consideration of the alleged facts in the \ncontext of the California’s Unfair Competition Law, California’s commercial misappropriation of Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n \nlikeness statute , the California common law right to publicity , and the righ t to privacy under the \nCalifornia Constitution.  Also, the Court consider ed the well -pleaded all egations in the context of New \nYork’s Civil Rights Act § 51.   \nAt no point did the Court consider or conclude that plaintiffs’ California and New York claims \nprotected the same set of  rights secured by BIPA —nor did plaintiffs make this argument in their briefs .  \nAs such, Macy’s contention that plaintiffs’ New York and California claims are really BIPA claims  \nincognito is not a question of law for interlocutory appeal.  See Lukis v. Whitepages Inc. , 542 F.Supp.3d \n831, 844 (N.D. Ill. 2020) (Feinerman, J.) (“ the question of law must be a ‘pure’ question of law, \n‘something the court of appeals could decide quickly and cleanly without having to study the record. ’”) \n(citation omitted).  \nConclusion  \n For the foregoing reasons,  the Court , in its discretion, denies Macy’s motion to certify an \ninterlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) [ 283]. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDate:  3/18/2022   \n      Entered: _____________________________ \n         SHARON JOHNSON COLEMAN \n         United States District Judge  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 6 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>",

R. 21 -1 ¶¶ 1, 16. The App uses artificial intelligence to extract a person’s face \nfrom a photo and transform it to look like a cartoon.  Id. ¶¶ 8, 34.  Plaintiffs are Illinois \ncitizens  who are users of the App . Id. ¶¶ 8, 14 –15. Plaintiffs allege that Wemagine \nviolates BIPA by collect ing, storing, and disclosing the facial geometry and biometric Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 1 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n data of Voila users  without their consent . Id. ¶¶ 8–10, 12– 13, 24, 33, 39, 43 –46, 51–\n53, 58– 60, 76 –78, 87 –88.  \nAfter this C ourt dismiss ed the original Complaint  for lack of personal \njurisdiction on January 26, 2022 (R. 19), it granted Plaintiffs ’ motion for leave to file \nan Amended Complaint  (R. 22). The Amended Complaint is di stinct  from the original  \nComplaint in two  notable  ways: first, it includes allegations regarding a second \nnamed plaintiff, Shannon Ross, who downloaded Voila  in Illinois and paid $29.99 for \nan annual Voila Pro subscription.  R. 21 -1 ¶¶  28–29, 32– 33, 55– 56. Second, the \nAmen ded Complaint alleges the App derive s substantial revenue from nearly 5,000 \nIllinois -based users due to subscription fees and its  display of third- party  advertising  \nto “free”  users.  Id. ¶¶ 18, 26–27, 31, 33, 50. Wemagine filed a  motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, arguing again  that this Court lacks  personal  \njurisdiction over Wemagine  and that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim . R. 24.  \nAnalysis  \n Plaintiffs’ additions  to the Amended Complaint  do not  salvage their claims, \nand the  Amended Complaint must again be dismissed for  many of the same reasons \nthis Court identified  in its Opinion granting Wemagine’s first motion to dismiss . See \nR. 19.  Courts may assert specific jurisdiction where (1) the defendan t has \npurposefully directed [its] activities at the forum state or purposefully availed [itself] \nof the privilege of conducting business in that state, and (2) the alleged injury arises \nout of the defendant's forum -related activities.” N. Grain Mktg., LLC v. Greving , 743 Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 2 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n F.3d 487, 492 (7th Cir. 2014) (citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, \n472 (1985)).  \nHere, Plaintiffs first argue that this Court has specific personal jurisdiction \nover Wemagine because, in addition to down loading and using Voila  in Illinois,  \nPlaintiff Gutierrez and other Illinois users of the free version are subject to  third -\nparty  advertising during their  use of the App . This, Plaintiffs contend,  generates  \nrevenue for Wemagine in Illinois . However , “advert isements or solicitation of \nbusiness is not enough to sustain personal jurisdiction in Illinois .” Linehan v. Golden \nNugget , 2008 WL 4181743, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 5, 2008) (citing Crum & Forster \nSpecialty  Ins. Co. v. Extended Stay America, Inc. , 873 N.E.2d 964 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st. \n2007)) ; see also Congdon v. Cheapcarribbean.com, Inc. , 2017 WL 5069960, at *7 (N.D. \nIll. Nov. 3, 2017) (no personal jurisdiction whe re solicitation, advertising, and  sales \nwere not conducted with any specificity to Illinois).  Like Congdon, here there is no \nevidence that Wemagine  purposefully directed any of its conduct toward Illinois, did \nany Illinois -specific shipping, marketing or advertising, or sought out the Illinois \nmarket in any way. Plaintiffs also do not  allege that  the advertisements shown to free \nusers in Illinois wer e for Illinois companies  or for Wemagine itself .  \nFurther, Plaintiffs do not allege that their injur ies arose out of the  third- party \nadvertis ements . Plaintiffs’ extensive citation of Keiken v. Music Corp, of America, \nInc., 1993 WL 280818 (N.D. Ill. July 26, 1993),  is erroneous because the court there \nlater overruled the  holding on which Plaintiff relies.  1994 WL 11617, at *2 (N.D. Ill. \nJan. 3, 1994) . On reconsideration, the Keiken court found that the plaintiff’s injury at  Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 3 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n a Florida theme park did not “arise out of ” the defendant’s Illinois advertisements \nbecause the plaintiff never saw the advertisements. Id. This holding conformed to  the \nsubstantial jurisprudence in Illinois  that advertisements  without a causal nexus to \nthe injury can not provide a basis for  personal jurisdiction. Id.1 In this case, too, \nWemagine’s alleged violation of BIPA did not arise out of  the third -party \nadvertisements  in question, which  only appear ed to users after the Ap p had already \nbeen downloaded, and were  not designed to encourage users  to download or use the \nApp.  Instead,  the alleged harm was occasioned by Gutierrez’s own conduct of \ndownloading and using the App.  As this Court has discussed, courts “should be \ncareful  in resolving questions about personal jurisdiction involving online contacts to \nensure that a defendant is not haled into court simply because the defendant owns or \noperates [an interactive] website that is accessible in the forum state.” Matlin v. Spin \nMaster Corp. , 921 F.3d 701, 706 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting Illinois v. Hemi Group  LLC, \n622 F.3d 754, 760 (7th C ir. 2010)). The refore, Plaintiff Gutierrez’s alleged basis of \nasserting personal jurisdiction via third party advertisement revenue fails.  \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ other authorities on this point are distinguishable for the same \nreasons. That is , the defendants in those cases specifically targeted  their marketing \nactivities to the forum states . See, e.g. , Doffing v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , Case No. 1:22 -\ncv-00100- CL, 2022 WL 3357698 , at * 4–5 (D. Or. July 20, 2022) ( court had personal \njurisdiction over app designer where it entered contracts with forum residents, sent \nthousands of communications to forum users, tracked and broadcasted user  locations, \nand provided location -based recommendations) ; Boone v. Sulphur Creek Resort, Inc. , \n749 F. Supp. 195, 199– 200 (S.D. Ind. 1990) (“Of primary importance . . . is the \nevidence that the Resort made the residents of [the forum state] specific targets  of \nthe Resort’s advertising . . .”) . Additionally, the advertisements had some sort of \ncausal connect ion to the purported claims. See, e.g. , Walker v. Carnival Cruise Lines, \nInc., 681 F. Supp. 470, 474 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (passenger’s injury on cruise ship arose \nout of cruise company’s advertising activities where passenger asserted that the company’s marketing  in the forum cause d her to book the cruise) . Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 4 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n  Neither does the allegation that  Plaintiff Ross paid for the Pro version of the \nApp in Illinois  establish  specific personal jurisdiction . The plaintiff cannot be the sole \nlink between a defendant and the forum. Kosar v. Columbia Sussex Management, \nLLC, 2021 WL 5356753, *6 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 16, 2021) (quoting Rogers v. City of Hobart , \n996 F.3d 812, 819 (7th Cir. 2021)). Again , the alleged injury must arise from the \ndefendant’s contacts with Illinois. See Kosar, 2021 WL 5356753 at *6.  \nIn be2 LLC v. Ivanov , Illinois residents accessed and created profiles on an \nonline dating site, but there was no evidence that the site targeted the Illinois market. \n642 F.3d 555, 559 (7th  Cir. 2011) (“ If the defendant merely operates a website, even \na ‘highly interactive ’ website, that is accessible from, but does not target, the forum \nstate, then the defendant may not be haled into court in that state without offending the Constitution. ”). Similarly, though Plaintiff Ross downloaded and paid for the Pro \nversion of Voila in Illinois, there is no evidence that Wemagine purposefully direct ed \nthe subscription toward Illinois  in a way that Wemagine availed itself of the privilege \nof doing business in the state. Id.  Like an interactive website, a ny alleged harm here \nwas occasioned by Plaintiff Ross’s own interaction with Voila —downloading and \naccessing  the App and then uploading his photo —rather than the Defendant’s specific \nactions in this jurisdiction. Matlin , 921 F.3d at  706; see also Breschia v. Paradise \nVacation Cl ub, Inc. , 2003 WL 22872128, at *3 (N.D.  Ill. Dec.4, 2003)  (dismissing for \nlack of personal jurisdiction where the only connection to the forum was that the \nplaintiff accessed the defendant ’s website to make and pay for a hotel reservation in \nthe forum ).   Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 5 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n Plaintiffs cite Huston v. Hearst Communications, Inc.  to support their claim \nthat subscriptions purchased in Illinois are enough to support personal jurisdiction; \nhowever, the court in Huston established that “personal jurisdiction also exists over \n[the defendant]  because it conducts subs tantial business within Illinois and has \nsignificant, continuous, and pervasive contacts in Illinois,” through the sale  and \nshipping  of physical products  to Illinois customers . 2022 WL 385176, at *1 (C.D. Ill. \nFeb. 7, 2022).  That is not true in this case . Plaintiffs’ other authorities are inapposite \nfor the same reason. See, e.g.,  King v. PeopleNet Corp., No. 21 CV 2774, 2021 WL \n5006692, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2021) ( defendan t shipped devices to Illinois  \ncustomers  for storage of biomet ric data ); Monster Energy Co. v. Wensheng , 136 F. \nSupp. 3d 897, 905 (N.D. Ill. 2015)  (defendants affirmatively creat ed a shipping option  \non their  website  to ship counterfeit  goods to Illinois); Trio v. Turing Video, Inc. , Case \nNo. 1:21- cv-04409, 2022 WL 4466050 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 26, 2022) (defendant executed \nnumerous “purchase orders with Illinois customers for sale and shipment of [COVID -\n19 screening equipment].”) .2 \nEven as replead, the Amended Complaint still fails to establish this Court’s \njurisdiction over Wemagine  as to Plaintiffs’ BIPA claims . The Amended Complaint \nmust be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. Thus, the  Court need not consider \nwhether Plaintiffs failed to state  a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) .  \n \n2 Plaintiffs cite to Ronquillo v. Doctor’s Assocs., LLC , 2022 WL 1016600  (N.D. Ill. \n2022)  in their supplemental authority. But that case considered a different question : \nwhether BIPA could be applied to residents outside Illinois, or whether the claims \nwere barred by the extraterritoriality doctrine. Id. at *4. Even so, there, the plaintiff’s \nbiometric data was collected and stored on -site in Illinois. Id. Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 6 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n \nConclusion  \n For the reasons set forth above, Wemagine’s motion to dismiss the Amended \nComplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, R. 24, is granted. This dismissal will be  \nwith out prejudice  as to any forum where personal jurisdiction  actually  exists .  \n       \n \n      ENTERED:  \n \n \n       __________________________________ \n      Honorable Thomas M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   In the court case of Sandra Trio vs. Turing Video, Inc., the plaintiff, Sandra Trio, individually and on behalf of others, alleges that Turing Video violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting, storing, and disseminating biometric data without proper consent. The case involves the use of Turing Shield, an AI-integrated kiosk, which scans users' facial geometry and performs temperature screenings. The Court denied Turing’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing the case to proceed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The central legal issue is whether Turing Video, Inc. violated BIPA by collecting, storing, and disseminating biometric information without obtaining informed written consent from users, including the plaintiff, and whether such actions warrant legal action.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The Court held that the plaintiff’s claims can proceed, as Turing Video's arguments for dismissal, including jurisdictional challenges and defenses related to federal preemption by the Labor Management Relations Act and the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, were not sufficient to warrant dismissal at this stage. The plaintiff adequately alleged violations under BIPA, and the Court found that it had specific personal jurisdiction over Turing Video.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you work at a store that uses a machine to check your temperature and see if you're wearing a mask. That machine also takes a picture of your face and stores it without telling you or asking for permission. Sandra, who worked at a store using this machine, is upset because she believes the company didn't follow the rules about protecting her personal biometric data. She took the company to court to stop them from using her data without permission. The judge said Sandra's concern is serious enough to go to trial, telling the company they have to face the lawsuit and respond to Sandra's claims.",
    "full_text": "1 IN THE  UNITED  STATES  DISTRICT  COURT  FOR  THE  \nNORTHERN  DISTRICT  OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN  DIVISION  \n \n \nSANDRA TRIO , individually and on behalf  ) \nof all others similarly situated,    ) \n     ) Plaintiff,     ) Case No. 1:21 -cv-04409  \n) \nv.      )  Judge John Robert Blakey  \n) \nTURING VIDEO, INC.,    ) \n  ) \nDefendant.     ) \n  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \nPlaintiff Sandra Trio filed this putative class action lawsuit in state court \nalleging that Defendant Turing Video, Inc. (“Turing”) violated the Illinois Biometric \nInformation Privacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 ILCS 14/1 et seq.  when it collected, stored, and \ndisseminated Plaintiff’s bi ometric information.  [1 -1].  Invoking  jurisdiction under the \nClass Action Fairness Act (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d), [1], Turing removed the \nlawsuit to this Court and now seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint pursuant to \nRules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), and 12(b)(6) , [27].  For the reasons explained below, the Court \ndenies Turing’s motion  [27].   \nI. Facts  \nThe following facts are taken from Plaintiff’s complaint, [ 1-1], and are assumed \nto be true for purposes of Turing’s amended  motion to dismiss , [27] .   \nDefendant Turing Video, Inc. , a California corporation with its principal place \nof business in California,  sells products integrated with artificial intelligence , which Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 1 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>2 provide security and health solutions to companies across an array of industries.  Id.  \n¶¶ 1, 25.  Specific to this lawsuit , Turing produces and sells various technologies  that \nallow business es to safeguard their employees and customers and assist them in \ncomplying with COVID -19 restrictions.  Id. ¶ 2.  Chief among these products is the \nTuring Shield, a kiosk that allows Turing’s customers to screen their employees for \nCOVID -19.  Id. ¶¶ 3, 42.    \nThe Turing Shield works by scanning the biometric data of its u sers.  Id. ¶ 42.  \nFirst, t he Turing Shield prompts a user to complete a health questionnaire on the \nuser’s phone.  Id. ¶ 4.  Once the user completes the questionnaire, a QR code appears \non the user’s phone that the Turing Shield  then scans to initiate a te mperature \nscreening.  Id.   To collect a temperature screening , users stand in front of the Turing \nShield’s camera , which  collects the user’s facial geometry and signals an alert when \nthe Turing Shield’s “artificial intelligence algorithm” recognizes the user .  Id. ¶ 5.  \nFrom there, the algorithm locates the user’s forehead and signals the Turing Shield’s built -in thermal se nsor to collect the user’s forehead temperature.  Id.   The Turing \nShield’s facial recognition software can  also detect whether the user is wearing a \nmask.  Id.  The Turing Shield then stores the data collected from the COVID -19 \nscreening in the Turing data base,  which can store up to  20 million “faces.”  Id.  ¶ 6.   \nAfter the  Turning Shield collects and stores a user’s  data in its  database, it \nanalyzes the data it collected to determine if the user passed the COVID -19 screening \nprocess .  Id. ¶ 7.  If the user  provided satisfactory results for the health questionnaire, \ntemperature screening, and mask detection, then the Turing Shield prints a badge Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 2 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>3 that indicates the user is cleared to enter the work environment.  Id.   For a negative \nscreening result , the Turing Shield print s a badge indicating the user has failed the \nscreening.  Id.    \nTuring’s databases store t he individuals’ facial geometry scans, along with the \nusers ’ temperature, health questionnaire responses, and face mask detection results, \nto track and report individuals who may have been exposed to COVID -19.  Id.  ¶ 43.  \nTuring’s customers can access the data collected by the Turing Shield by subscribing \nto Turing’s Data Access Management Platform, a software program that provides \nTuring’s cus tomers with centralized monitoring and reporting to identify users of the \nTuring Shield who may have been exposed to COVID -19.  Id.  ¶ 8.  The software \nprogram is cloud- based, which means data collected and obtained from the Turing \nShield is transmitted to  Turing ’s servers and other third parties who host that data \nsuch as  Amazon Web Services.  Id.  ¶ 44.  Turing  accesses its servers for various \npurposes , including support services for its customers .  Id.  ¶ 45.   \nFrom  April 2019 to June 2021, Plaintiff worked  as a cake decorator for New \nAlbertson’s, Inc. d/b/a Jewel -Osco at a location  in Algonquin, Illinois.  Id.  ¶ 53.   While \nemployed by Jewel -Osco, Plaintiff was required to use the Turing Shield each time \nshe began her workday  as part of the store’s COVID -19 screening process.  Id.  ¶¶ 54, \n56.  Turing stored the biometric data obtained from Plaintiff’s use of the Turing Shield \nin its databases , and later disseminated it to third  parties such as Amazon Web \nServices .  Id.  ¶¶ 55, 63.  Turing never inform ed Plaintiff of any limits on the purpose  \nof using such information or about any  limits  on the length of time for which Turing Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 3 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>4 would collect, store, use, and disseminate her biometric data.  Id. ¶ 57.  Plaintiff was \nnever provided wit h, nor did she ever sign, a written release authorizing  Turing to \ncollect, store, use, or disseminate her biometric data.  Id.  ¶ 58.  \nOn July 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit  in Illinois state court , alleging that \nTuring violated Section 15(b) of BIPA when it failed to obtain her informed written \nconsent and release prior to collecting her biometric identifiers and biometric \ninformation (Count I) and violated Section 15(d) of BIPA when it disseminated  her \nbiometric identif iers and biometric information to third  parties without first \nobtaining her consent (Count II) .  Id. ¶¶ 78 –87, 88– 96.  Plaintiff, individually and on \nbehalf of a class of all other individuals in Illinois who had their biometric data \ncollected, stored, use d, and disseminated by Turing, seek  declaratory and equitable \nrelief, statutory damages, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and other expenses provided \nfor under BIPA.  Id.  ¶¶ 68, 87, 96.   \nAfter timely removing this lawsuit to this Court o n August 18, 2021, [ 1], Turing  \nmoves to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), and 12(b)(6) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, [27].  \nII. Legal Standard  \nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the Court’s subject matter \njurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  If a defendant challenges the  facial  sufficiency \nof the allegations regarding subject matter jurisdiction , the Court must accept as true \nall well- pled factual allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in the p laintiff’s \nfavor.  Apex Digital, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. , 572 F.3d 440, 443- 44 (7th Cir. 2009).  Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 4 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>5 But where the complaint is “facially sufficient but external facts call the court’s \njurisdiction into question, we ‘may properly look beyond the jurisdict ional allegations \nof the complaint and view whatever evidence has been submitted on the issue to \ndetermine whether in fact subject matter jurisdiction exists.’”  Taylor v. McCament , \n875 F.3d 849, 853 (7th Cir. 2017) (quoting Apex Digital, Inc. , 572 F.3d at  444)).   \nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) challenges the Court’s personal \njurisdiction over a defendant.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  Under Rule 12(b)(2), a  \ncomplaint need not include facts alleging personal jurisdiction ; but once the \ndefendant moves to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(2), the plaintiff bears the \nburden of demonstrating the existence of jurisdiction.  Purdue Research Found. v. \nSanofi -Synthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, 782 ( 7th Cir. 2003).  Where, as here, the Court  \nrules on a Rule 12(b)(2) motion with out an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff need \nonly establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction.  Curry v. Revolution Labs., \nLLC, 949 F.3d 385, 392- 93 (7th Cir. 2020) ; GCIU -Employer Ret. Fund v. Goldfarb \nCorp. , 565 F.3d 1018, 1023 (7th Cir. 2009).  Where  the defendant  “has submitted \naffidavits or other evidence in opposition to the exercise of jurisdiction,” however, “the plaintiff must go beyond the pleadings and submit affirmative evidence supporting \nthe exer cise of jurisdiction.”  Purdue  Research Found. , 338 F.3d at 783.  T he Court \naccepts as true any facts in affidavits that do not conflict with the complaint or the plaintiff’s submissions,  Curry , 949 F.3d at 393, but the Court must resolve any \ndisputes concerning the relevant facts in the plaintiff’s favor.  Purdue  Research \nFound. , 338 F.3d at 782– 83.   Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 5 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>6 A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the \ncomplaint.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must allege  \n“sufficient factual matter” to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007) ).  A claim has facial plausibility “when the pleaded factual \ncontent allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  \nIn evaluating the c omplaint, this Court draws all reasonable inferences in the \nplaintiff’s favor and accepts  as true  all well- pled allegations; the Court need not, \nhowever, accept legal conclusions or conclusory allegations.  McCauley v. City of Chi ., \n671 F.3d 611, 616 (7th Cir. 2011) ( citing  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 681).  Unlike motions to \ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(2), however, the Court may not consider \nmatters outside of the pleadings.  See Geinosky v. City of Chi. , 675 F.3d 743, 746 n.1 \n(7th Cir. 2012) (“A motion u nder Rule 12(b)(6) can be based only on the complaint \nitself, documents attached to the complaint, documents that are critical to the \ncomplaint and referred to in it, and information that is subject to proper judicial \nnotice.”).   \nIII. Analysis  \nTuring move s to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint : under Rule 12(b)(1), arguing \nthat her claims  are preempted under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations \nAct (“LMRA”) , [28] at 8– 12; under Rule 12(b)(2), arguing that the Court lacks \npersonal jurisdiction over it ; and under Rule 12(b)(6) on the basis that Plaintiff’s Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 6 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>7 claims are barred by Illinois’ extraterritoriality doctrine and the federal Public \nReadiness and Emergency Preparedness Act , and that the  complaint fails to state a \nclaim under BIP A, id. at 5–19.  As “a federal court has leeway ‘to choose among \nthreshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits,’” Sinochem Intern. \nCo. Ltd. v. Malaysia Intern. Shipping Corp. , 549 U.S. 422, 431 (2007) (quoting \nRuhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil. C o., 526 U.S. 574, 585 (1999), the  Court first considers \nits personal jurisdiction over Turing and then turns to the issue of subject -matter \njurisdiction .      \nA. Personal Jurisdiction  \n \nA federal court sitting in diversity may exercise personal jurisdiction over a \ndefendant if authorized by the forum state’s long -arm statute and the United States \nConstitution.  Felland v. Clifton , 682 F.3d 665, 672 (7th Cir. 2012).  Illinois’ long arm \nstatute provides that a court may also exercise jurisdiction “ on any basis now or \nhereafter permitted by the Illinois Constitution and the Constitution of the United \nStates.”  735 ILCS 5/2- 209(c).  Because the Seventh Circuit has found no “operative \ndifference” between the two constitutional limits, this Court will limit its analysis to whether exercising jurisdiction over Turing comports with the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  Illinois v. Hemi Group LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 756– 57 (7th \nCir. 2010).    \nUnder well -established law, the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over \nnonresidents only when they have “minimum contacts” with Illinois such that \nlitigating the case here “does not offend traditional notions of fair play and Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 7 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>8 substantial justice. ”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945).  There \nare two types of personal jurisdiction, general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction.   \nGeneral jurisdiction exists when the defendant’s affiliations with the forum \nstate “are so constant and pervasive as to render [it] essentially at home” there.  \nDaimler AG v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117, 122 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nFor a corporation, this encompasses the state of its incorporation or the state where \nit maintains its principa l place of business.  Id. at 139.  Here, Plaintiff has not shown  \nthat this Court may exercise general jurisdiction over Turing  because the complaint \nalleges that Turing’s place of incorporation and principal place of business is in \nCalifornia, [1 -1] ¶ 25, and Turing’s unrebutted evidence demonstrates that Turing \nlacks the “continuous and systematic contacts as to render it essentially home” in \nIllinois , Daimler AG, 571 U.S. at 139 (cleaned up);  see also [28-1].1  Thus, the Court \ncannot exercise general personal jurisdiction  over Turing  based upon the record \nbefore it.       \nThe next type of personal jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction, depends upon the \nfacts of the case and exists when a  defendant has “purposefully directed his activities \nat residents of the forum” and “the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise \nout of or relate to those activities.”  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, \n472–73 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted) ; see also Bristol -Myers Squibb Co. \nv. Sup erior Ct. of California , 137 S. Ct. 1773, 1781 (2017) .  (“[T]here must be ‘an \n \n1 The parties submitted extrinsic evidence relevant  to the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over Turing, \nwhich the Court considers solely for Turing’s Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss.  See Purdue  Research \nFound. , 338 F.3d at 782 ; Curry , 949 F.3d at 393.   Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 8 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>9 affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, an activity \nor an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the \nState’ s regulation.”) (quoting Goodyear  Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown , 564 \nU.S. 915, 919 (2011)).   A c ourt’s  specific jurisdiction inquiry  must focus  on the \n“’relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation, ’—the ‘‘essential \nfoundation’  of specific jurisdiction.”  Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct. , \n141 S. Ct. 1017, 1028 (2021) ( quoting  Helicopteros Nacionales de Columbia, S.A. v. \nHall, 466 U.S. 408, 414 (1984)).  As part of this process , the Court first determine s \nwhether  the evidence demonstrates Turing has sufficient contacts with Illinois  and \nwhether those contacts “arise out of or relate to” Plaintiff’s claims.  See Walden v. \nFiore, 571 U.S. 277, 286 (2014) (“Due process requires that a defendant be haled into  \ncourt in a forum State based on his own affiliation with the State.”).    \nAs an initial matter, Turing argues that this Court does not have specific \njurisdiction because Turing, a non- forum resident, sold the Turing Shields that relate \nto Plaintiff’s injuries to Albertsons, Plaintiff’s employer (and a non -forum resident), \nand that Albertsons brought the Turing Shi elds it purchased from Turing into Illinois \nwithout discussion or prior notification to Turing.  [28] at 12.  In support of its Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss, Turing submits the declaration of Xing Zhong, Turing’s \nCo-Founder and Chief Operating Officer, [28-1].  Zhong states that Albertsons is one \nof Turing’s customers, and the two  entered into a contractual relationship on April 4, \n2020,  whereby Albertson bought Turing ’s Turing Shield k iosks to mitigate the spread \nof COVID -19 at Albertsons’  stores .  Id.  ¶ 13.  Turing does not  otherwise have a Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 9 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>10 contractual relationship with Jewel -Osco.  Id.  Zhong also avers  that Turing is not \nregistered to do business in Illinois, does not maintain offices, property, or bank \naccounts in Illinois, did not purposely target Illinois in the marketing and sales of \nTuring’s products, and that of its 121 employees, 82 are based in California and only \ntwo are in Illinois, both of whom were hired after  Plaintiff fi led this  lawsuit.  Id.  ¶¶ \n13–14.  With respect to Albertsons, Zhong states that Albertsons  only communicated  \nwith Turing ’s California -based  employees, that Turing sold Albertsons the Turing \nShield outside of Illinois, and that the two companies never met or developed a \nbusiness relationship in Illinois, had no specific agreement about deploying or \nservicing the Turing Shield in Illinois, and had no discussions about whether  \nAlbertsons would use  the Turing Shields in Illinois.  Id.  ¶ 15.   \nIn opposition to T uring’s Rule 12(b)(2) motion, Plaintiff submits Turing’s \nresponses to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories, [ 35-3], and dozens of purchase orders  \ninvolving the sale or shipment of  Turing Shields to customers  in Illinois , [37-2].  Both \nparties also submit excerpts of a transcript from Zhong’s deposition taken on the issue \nof personal jurisdiction.  [37 -1]; [43 -1].  The evidence demonstrates that, since Spring \n2020,  Turing ha d at least 30 customers in Illinois during the relevant period and that \nthe purchase  orders confirm it sold and shipped Turing Shields to customers in \nIllinois  on various occasions .  [35 -3] at 7–8; [37-1] at 42:10– 24, 58:12 –15, 104:12– 21; \n[37-2]; [43 -1] at  42:10– 24, 58:12– 15, 104:12 –21, 104:16 –105:2 .  In fact, one purchase \norder indicates  that Turing may have sold 106 Turing Shields to an Illinois -based Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 10 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>11 customer for nearly $366,000.00 and the 106 Turing Shields were  to be shipped to an \nIllinois address.  [37 -2] at 7 –8.   \nOverall, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s proffered evidence demonstrates that \nTuring has the requisite minimum contacts with Illinois for purposes of specific \npersonal jurisdiction.2  While Turing insists that the Court cannot assert jurisdiction \nover it because Turing has no  physica l presence in the state,   see [28] at 11; [43] at 9 , \n“physical presence is not necessary for a defendant to have sufficient minimum \ncontacts with a forum state ,” Curry , 949 F.3d at 398.  Rather, the existence of \nminimum  contacts with the forum state turns on whether the defendant has \n“purposefully directed his activities”  to the forum.   Id. (quoting Burger King , 471 U.S. \nat 476).  In other words, t he “inquiry boils down to this: has [Turing] purposely \nexploited the Illinois market?”  be2 LLC v. Ivanov , 642 F.3d 555, 558 ( 7th Cir. 2011).  \nThe record here demonstrates that Turing has  done so.  Turing  has at least 30 \ncustomers in Illinois and executed purchase orders with Illinois customers for the \n \n2  The parties quibble over the relevance of certai n facts that occurred after  Plaintiff brought suit, such \nas Turing’s hiring of two Illinois -based employees and Turing sending its employees to conferences \nhosted in Illinois.  The Seventh Circuit has not addressed whether a court should consider  a \ndefendant’s contacts with the forum state that occurred after the filing of the lawsuit , but several \ndistrict courts have reasoned that post -filing conduct cannot provide defendants with the “fair \nwarning” required under the due process analysis for spe cific jurisdiction.  See, e.g., United \nPhosphorus, Ltd. v . Angus Chemical Co. , 43 F. Supp.2d 904, 911 (N.D. Ill. 1999) (“While pre -suit \nactivities may rise to the level of a ‘fair warning’ that a defendant may be haled into a court in the \nforum state, post -suit activities cannot serve to warn the defendant of an event that has already \noccurred.”); Haggerty Enterprises, Inc. v. Lipan Indus. Co. , No. 00 C 766, 2001 WL 968592, at *4 (N.D. \nIll. Aug. 23, 2001) (declining to consider facts that occurred after the  filing of the complaint “because \njurisdiction is generally determined by facts existing at the case filing.”); NTE LLC v. Kenny \nConstruction Company , No. 14 C 9558, 2015 WL 6407532, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 15, 2015)  (“[P]ost -filing \ncontacts cannot serve the  Due Process purpose of the minimum contacts doctrine —that is, they cannot \ngive the defendant fair warning that he could be ‘haled into court in the forum state’ before the lawsuit is filed.”).  The Court need not decide this issue now  because  Turing has s ufficient pre -suit contacts \nwith Illinois notwithstanding any contacts it may have had with the state after  Plaintiff filed her \nlawsuit.  Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 11 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>12 sale and shipment of Turing Shields.  Thus, Turing’s contacts with Illinois are  not \nthe result of “random, fortuitous, or attenuated”  circumstances  or due to the \n“unilateral activity of another party or third person,” Curry , 949 F.3d at 396, but \nindicate  Turing engaged in commercial activity purposefully directed at  Illinois \nsufficient  to hale it  into Illinois  courts.  See id. at 398 (“[S]uch  ‘purposeful direction’ \nmay be shown by evidence that the defendant’s actions, even if initiated outside of \nthe forum state, nevertheless were directed at the forum state.  For example, a \ndefendant may cause its product to be distributed in the forum state .”); Logan Prods ., \nInc. v. Optibase, Inc. , 103 F.3d 49, 53 ( 7th Cir. 1996) (“For no matter which party got \nthe ball rolling, if Optibase intentionally served the Wisconsin market, Optibase \npurposefully established sufficient minimum contacts to subject it to personal \njurisdiction in Wisconsin.”); Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 475 (1985) \n(“So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are ‘purposefully directed’ toward residents \nof another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an abs ence of physical \ncontacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.”).   And although Turing argues that \nit had a nationwide marketing strategy for its Turing Shield and did not specifically \ntarget Illinois , [43] at 8, “[t]here is no per se requirement that t he defendant \nespecially target the forum in its business activity ,” Curry , 949 F.3d at 399.  In any \nevent,  the Seventh Circuit has found similar arguments unpersuasive especially \nwhere, as here, the evidence indicates that Turing derived revenue from its s ale of \nthe Turing Shield to dozens of Illinois customers.  See, e.g.  uBID, Inc. v. GoDaddy \nGrp., Inc. , 623 F.3d 421, 428– 29 (7th Cir. 2010) (“[I]t is easy to infer that GoDaddy’s Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 12 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>13 national marketing campaign is intended to reach as large an audience as possible, \nincluding the 13 million potential customers in the nation’s fifth most populous \nstate.”); Illinois v. Hemi Group LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 758 ( 7th Cir. 2010) (finding \nsufficient contacts with Illinois where defendant’s website stated it does business \nwith the residents of forty -nine states and  evidence demonstrated that it  “knowingly \ndid do business with Illinois residents.”).   \nThe cases cited by Turing in support of its argument  all involve facts where \nthe defendant lacked any contacts with the relevant forum state  or that the contacts \nwith the forum  state did not demonstrate that defendant had “purposefully availed” \nor otherwise targeted residents of the forum state.  See Salkau skaite v. Sephora USA, \nInc., No. 18 -cv-08507, 2020 WL 2796122, at *4– 5 (N.D. Ill. May 30, 2020) (finding no \npersonal jurisdiction where evidence showed defendant had not provided its \ntechnology to Illinois customers and where its only Illinois -related cont act was a \nsocial media post discussing the use of its technology at a customer’s Illinois location); Stein v. Clarifai, Inc. , 526 F. Supp.  3d 339, 345 (N.D. Ill. 2021) (finding no personal \njurisdiction where defendant derived only 7 cents in revenue from two Illinois customers who interacted with defendant through a website); Gullen v. \nFacebook.com, Inc. , No. 15 C 7681, 2016 WL 245910, at *2– 3 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 21, 2016) \n(finding no personal jurisdiction where complaint’s only allegation of defendant’s forum -related contact was that defendant operated a website accessible to Illinois \nresidents); Bray v. Lathem Time Co. , No. 19 -3157, 2020 WL 1492742, at *4 (C.D. Ill. \nMar. 20, 2020) (finding no personal jurisdiction where unrebutted evidence Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 13 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>14 demonstrated that defendant’s only Illinois -related contact was the operation of a \nwebsite accessible to its Illinois customers); McGoveran v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc., \n488 F. Supp.  3d 714, 722 (S.D. Ill. 2020) ( “[T]here is no indication that either of these \ncompanies purposefully directed their activities at Illinois residents. ”); Roiser v. \nCascade Mountain, Inc. , 855 N.E.2d 243, 248 (Ill. App. Ct. 2006) ( “The R osiers’ \nlawsuit is not based on any activity within Illinois; therefore, specific jurisdiction \nprinciples are not relevant to their appeal.”).  In contrast to the cases cited by \nDefendant, the evidence here demonstrates that Turing  specifically targeted Il linois \nand its residents in the sale of its products.   \nIn addition to establishing the existence of sufficient minimum contacts, \nPlaintiff must demonstrate that the contacts “arise out of or relate to” the litigation.  \nTuring argues that its contacts with Illinois are “non -suit related business \noperations” and that its Illinois contacts have no causal connection to Plaintiff’s \nclaims.  [43] at 8.  But this is precisely the sort of argument the Supreme Court \nrejected in Ford Motor Co.  v. Montana Eight Judic ial District Ct. , where the Court  \nheld that  it has “never framed the specific jurisdiction inquiry as always requiring \nproof of causation —i.e. , proof that the plaintiff’s claims came about because of the \ndefendant’s in -state conduct.”   141 S. Ct. at 1026.  Rather, the inquiry requires that \na plaintiff’s lawsuit “arise out of or  relate to” the defendant’s contacts with the forum \nstate , which  “contemplates that some relationships will support jurisdiction without \na causal showing.”  Id.     Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 14 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>15 Ford Motor Co.  involved two product liability lawsuits  brought  in Montana and \nMinnesota state  courts against the manufacturer of a vehicle that caused the \nplaintiffs injuries in the forum states.  Id.  at 1022.  The d efendant  argued that its \ncontacts with the forum states —limited to advertising, maintaining car dealerships, \nand providing parts and services for it s products in the forum states —had no causal \nrelationship to plaintiffs’ claims because it designed, manufactured and sold the \nvehicl es that caused their injuries outside of the forum states , and because plaintiffs  \nhad obtained  the specific vehicles involved in their injuries through later resales.  Id. \nat 1023.  The Supreme Court disagreed, noting that although there are “real limits” \nto this inquiry, a “strong relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the \nlitigation” exists because defendant’s contacts  indicated that it “had systematically \nserved a market in [the forum states] for the very vehicles that the plaint iffs allege \nmalfunctioned and injured them in those states.”  Id.  at 1029.   \nHere, Turing’s contacts with Illinois , like the defendant in Ford Motor Co. , \n“relate to” Plaintiff’s claims because Turing’s contacts  with Illinois  involve sales  of \nthe very same Turing Shields that led to  Plaintiff’s alleged  injury.  Like the plaintiffs \nin Ford , Plaintiff  here is a resident  of the forum state , and used the same Turing \nShield that Turing has sold and shipped to other Illinois customers .  And because \nPlaintiff’s injuries arise from her use of the Turing Shield in Illinois without the protections afforded to her under Illinois law, she brought  this law suit “in the most \nnatural state —based on an ‘affiliation between the forum and the under lying Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 15 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>16 controversy, principally, an activity or an occurrence that took place there.”  Id.  \n(quoting Bristol -Myers, 137 S. Ct., at 1179– 80).   \nFinally, the Court must determine whether asserting jurisdiction over a \ndefendant “offend s traditional notions of f air play and substantial justice.”  Int’l Shoe \nCo., 326 U.S. at 316.  To do so, the Court considers  “the burden on the defendant, the \nforum State ’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff ’s interest in obtaining \nconvenient and effective relief, the interstate judicial system ’s interest in obtaining \nthe most efficient resolution of [the underlying dispute], and the shared interest of \nthe several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies .”  Purdue  \nResearch Found ., 338 F.3d at 781 (internal quotation omitted).  As the Seventh \nCircuit has noted, “as long as the plaintiff has made a threshold showing of minimum \ncontacts, that showing is generally defeated only where the defendant presents ‘a compelling case that the  presence of some other considerations would render \njurisdiction unreasonable.’”  Curry , 949 F.3d at 402 ( quoting  Burger King , 471 U.S. \nat 477).  Here, T uring simply argues that  “it would be unfair to subject a California \nentity with no contacts to Illinoi s to this Court’s jurisdiction.”  [43] at 1 5–16.  But, as \ndiscussed above, Turing has sufficient contacts with Illinois that relate  to the claims \nbrought by Plaintiff , and it points to no other reason that would render jurisdiction \notherwise unreasonable or unfair .  See Curry , 949 F.3d at 402 (“There is no unfairness \nin requiring a defendant to defend a lawsuit in the courts of the state where, through the very activity giving rise to the suit, it continues to gain so much.”) ; Hemi , 622 \nF.3d at 760 (finding that jurisdiction in Illinois was fair where defendant had Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 16 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>17 established an “expansive, sophisticated commercial venture online,” held itself out \nto conduct business nationwide, and succeeded in reaching customers across the \ncountr y.”).  In any event , the Court finds  Illinois has a strong interest in providing a \nforum for individuals who wish to seek redress for BIPA violations even if a non -\nforum resident inflicted the alleged harms and Plaintiff here seeks to represent a \nclass of all individuals in Illinois who had their biometric data collected by Turing.  \nSee [1-1] ¶ 68.  Accordingly, the Court denies Turing’s Rule 12(b)(2) m otion to dismiss.   \nB. Subject -Matter Jurisdiction:  Preemption Under the LMRA  \nTuring next argues that this Court lacks  subject -matter jurisdiction over \nPlaintiff’s claims because they are preempted by Section 301 of the Labor \nManagement Relations Act (“LMRA”), 29 U.S.C. § 185 .     \nSection 301 of the LMRA establishes federal jurisdiction over “suits for \nviolations of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing \nemployees in an industry affecting commerce” without respect to the amount in controversy or citizens hip of the parties.  29 U.S.C. § 185(a).  T he Supreme Court has \ninterpreted this provision as one that  “express es a federal policy that federal courts \nshould enforce these agreements on behalf of or against labor organizations.”  Textile \nWorkers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Ala. , 353 U.S. 448, 455 (1957).  This \nfederal policy would be thwarted, however, if the resolution of Section 301 claims \ninvolved conflicting applications of state and federal law.  See Local 174, Teamsters, \nChauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of Am . v. Lucas Flour , 369 U.S. 95, 103 \n(1962) (“The possibility that individual contract terms might have different meanings Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 17 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>28 they are intended to be used for a medical purpose  but in an effort to expand these \nsystems’ availability during the COVID -19 public health emergency, the FDA intends \nto “not object” to their use for medical purposes provided the y comply with the \nEnforcement Policy’s recommendations, such as  adding labels on the systems that \nhelp users understand the device and caution the device is not FDA -cleared or \napproved.  Enforcement Policy at 4.  Yet, e ven if the Turing Shield might meet the \nFDA’s recommendations outlined in the Enforcement Policy (which the Court canno t \ndetermine based solely on the pleadings), the Enforcement Policy does not give \ntelethermographic systems “de facto ” clearance  in accordance with the FDCA’s \ncomplex statutory and regulatory scheme.  See, e.g. , 21 U.S.C. § 360c et seq .; Riegel v. \nMedtronic, Inc. , 552 U.S. 312 (2008) (discussing the premarket approval process for \ndevices under the FDCA, which the court describes as a “rigorous process,” and the \napproval process for devices under Section 510(k) of the FDCA).  To the contrary , the \nEnforcement Policy states the general rule that telethermographic systems intended \nfor medical purposes must receive approval from the FDA under the FDCA.  See \nEnforcement Policy at 7  (“In general, manufacturers of telethermographic systems \nintended for adjunctive dia gnostic screening are required to submit premarket \nnotification pursuant to section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and 21 \nCFR 807.81 to FDA and receive FDA clearance prior to marketing these devices in the United States, as well as comply with p ostmarketing requirements.”).  \nFurther more , the Policy states that the FDA will “not object” to the use of \ntelethermographic systems for medical purposes for the duration of the COVID -19 Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 28 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>29 public health emergency  if, among other things, manufacturers include labels \ncaution ing that the devices are not FDA -cleared or approved.6  \n In short, t he PREP Act’s definition of “covered countermeasures” is clear and \nunambiguous.  It provides immunity only for “claims for los s” that “arise or relate to” \nthe use of a covered countermeasure.  Because there is nothing in the record to \nindicate that the Turing Shield meets the requirements of the PREP Act’s definition \nof a “covered countermeasure,” the PREP Act’s immunity provisions do not apply  to \nPlaintiff’s BIPA claims.  Accordingly, the Court denies Turing’s motion to dismiss  on \nthis basis.7   \nc. Sufficiency of Plaintiff’s BIPA  Claims  \nFinally, Turing argu es that the Complaint  fails to allege that Turing collected, \ncaptured or possessed any “biometric identifiers” or “biometric information” as \ndefined under BIPA.  [28] at 21.  Turing insists that the data it collected from \nPlaintiff’s face does not qualify as a “scan of facial geometr y” under BIPA  because a \n \n6 Moreover, even if the Enforcement Policy constituted a “ de facto ” FDA clearance, the non -binding \nnature of the Enforcement Policy means it is not entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. \nNational Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  The Enforcement Policy plainly states \nthat “[t]his guidance  represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration [] on this \ntopic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.”  \nEnforcement Policy at 1; s ee also  21 C.F.R. § 10.115(d)(1) (“Guidance documen ts do not establish \nlegally enforceable rights or responsibilities.”).  As the Seventh Circuit has noted, the court remains \n“extraordinarily reluctant to follow unofficial interpretations which the agency itself does not view as \nbinding.”  Echevarria v. Ch i. Title & Trust Co. , 256 F.3d 623, 629 (7th Cir. 2001); see also  Christensen \nv. Harris Cnty. , 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (“Interpretations such as those in opinion letters —like \ninterpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law —do not warrant Chevron -style deference.”).   \n \n7 Plaintiff also argues that her injuries have no causal connection to her use of the Turing Shield as \nan alleged “countermeasure”  because her claims involve Turin g’s failure to provide her with required \ndisclosures and obtain her written consent prior to collecting her biometric information, [37] at 24.  The Court need not address this argument given its finding  that the Turing Shield does not qualify as  \na covered countermeasure under the PREP Act.   \n Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 29 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>30 scan of a face geometry only encompasses “a ‘scan’ by ‘facial recognition software’ that \n‘extracts a highly detailed map or template for each face based on its unique points \nand contours.’”  [28] at 15 (quoting Monroy , 2017 WL 40998 46, at *1) .  Here, Turing \nrelies  upon a definition of “scan of face geometry” that does  not come  from BIPA itself \nbut rather from another court’s recitation of what the plaintiff in another BIPA case \nalleged the defendant’s technology did.  See Monroy , 2017 WL 4099846, at *1 \n(“Shutterfly’s facial recognition software scans the image, locates each of the faces in \nthe image, and extracts a highly detailed ‘map’ or ‘template’ for each face based on its \nunique points and contours.”).  BIPA ’s operative legal tex t, however, defines  \n“biometric identifier” as a “retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand \nor face geometry” and defines “biometric information” as “any information, regardless \nof how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.”  740 ILCS 14/10.   Thus, t he real issue here \nis whether Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to allow for a plausible inference that \nthe Turing Shield collected Plaintiff’s “biometric identifier” or stored her “biometric \ninformation” as those terms are defined under the plain language of BIPA.  \n The Court concludes that she has  done so.  In her complaint, Plain tiff alleges \nthat the Turing Shield utilizes an “artificial intelligence algorithm” to detect a user’s \nforehead in order to take the user’s temperature and also uses “facial recognition \nsoftware” to detect whether the user is wearing a face mask.  [1 -1] ¶ 5.  In addition to \ntemperature screenings and face mask detection, the Turing Shield also allegedly  \n“recognize s the user” by using its camera to “collect[] the user’s facial geometry” and Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 30 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>31 analyzes  the data through the use of an  algorithm , id., and then stores the data \ncollected from the screening in Turing’s database(s), which can identify up to 20 \nmillion faces.  Id.  ¶ 6.  These allegations allow for a  plausible inference that the \nTuring Shield’s temperature screening, face mask detection, and facial recog nition \nfunctions require  a scan of Plaintiff’s face , which amounts to a “scan of . . . face \ngeometry” within BIPA’s definition s of biometric identifier and biometric \ninformation.  Plaintiff also alleges that Turing collected and disseminated this data \nto third parties without providing her with the disclosures required by BIPA or \nreceiving her written consent.  Id. ¶¶ 57– 58, 63.  Thus, Plaintiff  also alleg es a \nplausible claim against Turing for violations of Section 15(b) and (d) of BIPA.  See 740 \nILCS 14/15(b), (d).  \nFinally, Turing’s last argument —that Plaintiff failed to allege how the Turing \nShield identifies employees based on the temperature screening or face mask \ndetection function —cannot be resolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  [28] at \n22; [41] at 18.  At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need not allege “detailed factual \nallegations,” but must allege “enough factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim \nto relief that is plausible on its face.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 570)).  As discussed above, Plaintiff has alleged that the Turing Shield’s “artificial intelligence algorithms” analyze a user’s face scan to not only screen a user’s temperature and detect for face masks, but also recognize a user against a \ndatabase that can store up to 20 million faces.  [1- 1] at ¶¶ 5, 6.  Further discovery Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 31 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>32 \nmay shed light on exactly how the Turing Shield does this but, at the pleading stage, \nPlaintiff’s allegations suffice  to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.   \nIV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case centers on a dispute between Aaron M. Ogletree and Cleveland State University over the university's practice of conducting room scans before remote examinations. Ogletree contended that these scans, which involved using a student's camera to check for impermissible aids during a remote test, violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The court, analyzing the privacy expectations in a student's home and the absence of a sufficiently pressing need for such invasive measures, found in favor of Ogletree, ruling that room scans constitute an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the room scans conducted by Cleveland State University during remote examinations constitute an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the room scans conducted by Cleveland State University are indeed searches under the Fourth Amendment and are unreasonable. Therefore, they violate the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're taking a test at home, and your school wants to make sure you're not cheating by asking to look around your room using your webcam. The court decided that this is too much of an invasion of your privacy, like having a stranger peek into your private space without a good reason, and ruled that it wasn't okay under the law.",

OGLETREE , \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nv. \n CLEVELAND STATE \nUNIVERSITY , \n \nDefendant.  \n ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n Case No. 1:21-cv-00500  \n Judge J. Philip Calabrese  \n \n \nOPINION AND O RDER \n Even before the Covid -19 pandemic, Cleveland State University offered \ncourses online and used various methods to ensure the integrity of remote tests.  One \nmethod involves using a student’s camera briefly to scan the test taker’s surroundings \nfor potential  impermissible study aids or notes.  Plaintiff Aaron Ogletree , a student \nat Cleveland State University, filed suit alleging that this practice or policy violated \nhis rights when a proctor asked him to conduct a room scan of his bedroom before \nstarting a re mote test.   \nPlaintiff and Defendant each move for summary judgment.  For the following \nreasons, the Court DENIES  Defendant’s motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 29)  \nand GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion  (ECF No. 30) . Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  1 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>2 STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n This case arises out of a scan Cleveland State University conducted of a \nstudent’s bedroom in connection with a remote test Mr. Ogletree took for one of his \nclasses .  The record contains the following facts, which are largely undisputed.   \nA. Cleveland State’s Remote  Testing Policies  \nCleveland State University offers some classes remotely.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 11, \nPageID #146; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 11, PageID #160.)  In May 2016, Cleveland State \npublished campus -wide guidelines for online classes in a document titled “ Required  \nProcedures & Recommended  Practices to Address Security and Quality of eLearning \nCourses.”   (ECF No. 25 -2, PageID #330.)   One of the purposes of the document was \nto ensure the integrity of remote tests.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #268.)  \nA required procedure mandates that students taking online classes have a \nphotograph in Cleveland State’s database  at the time of registration  so as “to \neliminate impersonation and to ensure that the same student enrolled in the course \nis attending the online lectures and taking  the exams.”  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID \n#273– 74; ECF No.  25-2, PageID #330.)  However, Cleveland State does not enforce \nthis procedure , and some students taking online classes do not have a photograph in \nthe database.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #272– 74.) \nIn addition to requir ed procedures, the University’s recommended practices \nleave testing “to the faculty member’s discretion to implement.”  (ECF No. 25 -2, \nPageID #331.)   Some recommended practices include randomiz ing the order of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  2 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>3 questions, us ing timed tests, and using  remote proctoring tools.  (Id., PageID \n#331– 32.)   \nAs remote proctoring tools, Cleveland State offers several programs  desig ned \nto enhance  “online test security and proctoring.”  ( Id., PageID #332.)  For instance, \nCleveland State’s  learning management system , Blackboard , offers a plagiarism \ndetection system  and generates  reports “that faculty can use to see more information \nabout student activity, including  the IP address from where they logged in, how much \ntime they spent in the exam .”  (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #262– 63 & 312.)  Cleveland \nState also uses the proctoring tools Rospondus  and Honorlock.  ( Id., PageID # 291.)   \nFor Respondus, Respondus LockDown Browser prevents students from accessing the \ninternet or using other computer programs during a remote test, while Rospondus \nMonitor records the student taking the exam and uses artificial  intelligence to flag \nsuspicious activ ity.  (Id., PageID # 305– 06 & 321.)  Similarly, Honorlock uses a \nstudent’s camera  and artificial intelligence monitoring.   (Id., PageID #299.)   Among \nthese remote proctoring tools, faculty members have discretion to choose which tool \nor combination of tools , if any, are necessary to preserve the integrity of the remote \nexam.  ( Id., PageID #275– 76 & 295.) \nB. Cleveland State ’s Use of Room Scans  \nCleveland State neither requires nor  recommends the use of a room scan  \npursuant to any written policy .  (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #277.)   In a non- proctored \nexam, there is no room scan.  ( Id., PageID #283.)   However, each of the online \nproctoring tools that Cleveland State  uses, Respondus and Honorlock, requires a Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  3 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>4 room scan as part of its prerecorded instructions.  ( Id., PageID #291– 93.)  In  in-person \nproctored exams , the test coordinator at Cleveland State University  Testing Services \ninformed Mr. Ogletree by email that it has a process of performing a “cursory review \nof [the student’s] immediate testing space,” and “[a]ll  students, regardless of the \ncourse or instructor, are asked to do this as part of the check -in process.”   (ECF No. \n26-7, PageID #413.)    \nWhen a student takes an o nline exam , it proceeds as follows.  First, at the \noutset of a  proctored online exam, whether  proctored through an electronic \napplication or an actual person, students must “show their ID next to their face so \nyou can clearly see and read the ID and be able to tell that that person is the same person that is on the ID.”  (ECF No.  25-1, PageID #282 ; ECF No. 24 -1\n, PageID #202.)   \nSecond , either the proctoring application or the proctor prompts  the student to \nconduct a room scan of his  environment.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #282; ECF No. 24 -1, \nPageID #211 .)  Other students taking the remote test can see the room scans of other \nstudents.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #212.)  \nThe proctor who performed the room scan at issue in this case testified that \nher supervisor , the Cleveland State Testing Services ’ test coordinato r, instructed her \nto perform the room scan.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #214.)  Further, the proctor \npresumed that a room scan was required unless the professor in the class instructed \notherwise.  ( Id., PageID #215.)  As to whether students may refuse to conduc t the \nroom scan, the proctor testified that she never had a student refuse , and she was not \naware of a Cleveland State policy addressing how to handle a student’s refusal.  ( Id., Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  4 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>5 PageID #213.)   The proctor testified that in the event of a refusal, she would allow \nthe student to take the test but notify the professor that the student refused to \nperform the room scan.  ( Id.) \nC. Mr. Ogletree’s Enrollment at Cleveland State  \n At the time of the events relevant to this action, Mr. Ogletree studied \nchemistry at Cleve land State University.  ( ECF No. 26- 1, PageID #352.)  For the \nspring 2021 semester , Mr. Ogletree enr olled in five classes.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 39,  \nPageID #1 49–50.)  Due to the Covi d-19 pandemic, most Cleveland State classes \nduring the spring 2021 semester were  conducted remotely.  ( ECF No. 1 , ¶ 40, PageID \n#150; ECF No.  19, ¶ 40, PageID #163.)    \nIn the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that during the spring 2021 semester, \nCleveland State required students to complete and pass a “Daily Health Assessment” \nto attend a class in -person  on campus .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 42,  PageID #150.)   Attending \nclasses in person was not an option for him, Plaintiff says, because of “various health issues that impact his immune system and put him at particular risk to the COVID pandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 45, PageID #150.)   Further, “[b]ecause of his health issues, \nOgletree does not pass the Daily Health Assessment” ; therefore , Cleveland State  \nwould not permit him to take his tests in -person on campus .  (Id., ¶¶ 46 & 47 , PageID \n#150.)   Plaintiff also alleged he has “family members who are at high -risk to the \npandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 48, PageID #150.)  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  5 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>6 D. The Room Scan  \nIn January 2021, Mr. Ogletree disputed a policy contained in the syllabus for \nhis General Chemistry II class.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 49, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 49, \nPageID #164.)   The policy stated:   “The proctors and I reserve the right to ask any \nstudent, before, during, or after an exam to show their surroundings, screen, and/or \nwork area.  We will send you a private chat to ask you  to do this.  If you do not see \nthe chat message, I will use the microphone to ask you to check the chat.”  ( Id.)  Three \ndays later, the Professor removed the  policy  from the syllabus .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 50, \nPageID  #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 50, PageID #164.)   \n On February 17, 2021, Mr. Ogletree had a General Chemistry II remote test \nscheduled for 12:30 pm.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 51, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 51, PageID \n#164.)  At the time, Mr. Ogletree lived with his mother an d two siblings, who were all \nhome when Mr. Ogletree took the chemistry exam.  ( ECF No. 26 -1, PageID #354– 55.)  \nCleveland State requires students to take remote tests in a location where they will \nbe alone and uninterrupted.  ( ECF No. 17 , PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , PageID #165.)  \nMr. Ogletree testified that his bedroom was the only suitable testing environment.  (\nECF No. 26 -1, PageID #366.)   \nThat morning, at 10:25 am, almost two hours before scheduled exam, \nCleveland State Testing Services emailed Mr. Ogletree to inform him the proctor \nwould be “checking your ID, your surroundings and your materials.”  ( ECF No. 26 -5, \nPageID #4 09.)  At 10:40 am, Mr. Ogletree replied to the email.  ( Id.)  Mr. Ogletree \nexplained that he “currently [had] confidential settlement do cuments in the form of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  6 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>7 late arriving 1099s scattered about [his] work area and there is not enough time to \nsecure them.”  ( Id.)  \n At the start of the exam, the proctor asked Mr. Ogletree to perform a room scan \nof his bedroom , and Mr. Ogletree complied .  (ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #226.)  The scan \nlasted less than a minute , and as little as ten to twenty seconds .  (Id., PageID #227 ; \nECF No. 26 -1, PageID #368.)  The proctor testified that she did not see any tax \ndocuments or medications.   (ECF No.  24-1, PageID #239 –40.) \n The room scan and the test were recorded,  and the video recording was \nretained by Cleveland State’s third -party  vendor.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301.)  \nCleveland State is not aware of any dat a breaches related to remote exam  recordings , \nand access to the video is strictly controlled.   (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301 ; ECF No. \n24-1, PageID #236– 37.) \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n Based on these facts, Plaintiff  alleges  that Defendant violated his rights under  \nthe Fourth Amendment and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief.  ( ECF No. 17 , \nPageID #152 –53.)  Both Plaintiff and Defendant move  for summary judgment.   (ECF \nNos. 29 & 30.)  \nANALYSIS \nPursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary \njudgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.  R. \nCiv. P. 56(a).  On a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view evidence in Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  7 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>8 the light most favorable to the non -moving party.  Kirilenko -Ison v. Board of Educ. of \nDanville Indep. Schs., 974 F.3d 652, 660 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Matsushita Elec. \nIndus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp ., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)).  Ultimately, the \nCourt mu st determine whether “one party must prevail as a matter of law.”  Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 242, 251 (1986) .   \nI. Fourth Amendment  Searches  \nThe Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.”  \nU.S. Const. amend. IV; United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 404 (2012).  Plaintiff \ncontends t hat Cleveland State’s policy of conducting warrantless room scans of \nstudents’ homes violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable \nsearches as it applies to the State of Ohio through the Fourteenth Amendment.  ( ECF \nNo. 17 , PageID #153.)   \n At the outset, the parties contest whether the remote virtual room scans at \nissue qualify as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Specifically, \nthey debate whether the Fourth Amendment applies under Wyman v. James, 400 \nU.S. 309 (1971), and its progeny.   \nI.A. General  Principles \n A Fourth Amendment search “occurs when the government violates a \nsubjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.”  Kyllo v. \nUnited States , 533 U.S. 27, 33 (2001) (citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361 \n(1967) ).  Even in the expressly  protected location of a house, which receives Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  8 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>9 heightened protection under the Fourth Amendment, a  search within the meaning of \nthe Constitution does not occur unless “the individual manifested a subje ctive \nexpectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,” and society is “willing \nto recognize that expectation as reasonable.”  Id.  (citing California v. Ciraolo , 47 U.S. \n207, 211 (1986)).  \nPlaintiff contends  that the  remote  room  scans at issue are Fourth Amendment \nsearches because students have a subjective expectation of privacy in their houses , \nand especially in their bedrooms, and society recognizes that expectation as \nreasonable.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #499.)  In response, Defendant maintains  that \nPlaintiff’s subjective expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable.   (ECF \nNo. 34, PageID #512.)   Defendant points to evidence showing that room  scans are \n“standard industry wide practice” and that students frequently acquiesce in  their use.  \n(ECF No. 34 , PageID #512– 14.)   \nAlthough the record shows that no student, other than Mr. Ogletree, ever \nobjected to the scans ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #213), the facts  also implicate the core \nplaces where society, to the extent it can agree on much  these days , recognizes \nreasonable and legitimate privacy interests —namely, the home.  Though schools may \nroutinely employ remote technology to peer into houses without objection from some, \nmost, or nearly  all students, it does not follow that others might  not object to the \nvirtual intrusion into their homes or that the routine use of a practice such as room scans does not violate a privacy interest that society recognizes  as reasonable, both \nfactually and legally.  Therefore, the Court determines that Mr. Ogletree’s subjective Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  9 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>10 expectation of privacy at issue is one that society views as reasonable and that lies at \nthe core of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against governmental intrusion.  \nTo support the argument that the expectation of privacy Plaintiff claims is \nobjectively unreasonable, Defendant relies on several  cases.  First , Defendant argues \nthat the room  scans are  not searches because they are  routine .  For this proposition, \nDefendant cites California v. Ciraolo , 476 U.S. 207, 215 (1986) , in which the Supreme \nCourt held that it was unreasonable to expect that marijuana plants were \nconstitutionally protected from being observed from an altitude of 1,000 feet “in an age where private and commercial  flight in the public airways is routine.”   See also \nFlorida v. Riley , 488 U.S. 445, 449– 50 (1989) (same).  In Ciraolo and Riley , due to  \nmodern  flight  technology and its routine use, the marijuana plants were  openly  \nobservable.   These cases build on the traditional notion that governmental officials,  \nlawfully in a public place, do not conduct unlawful searches simply by  observ ing \nthings  in plain view.  But the room scans peer behind walls and make visible places \noutside the ambit of cases such as Ciraolo and Riley .  Rooms scans go where people \notherwise would not, at least not without a warrant or an invitation.  \nNor does it follow that room  scans are not searches because the technolog y is \n“in general public use.”  Defendant cites Kyllo , 533 U.S. at 34– 40, in which the \nSupreme Court held that law enforcement’s use of thermal imaging technology  not \n“in general public use” to explore the interior of the home constituted a Fourth \nAmendment search .  But t he Supreme Court did not  hold the inverse —that the use \nof a technology “in gene ral public use”  could not be a Fourth Amendment search.   To Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  10 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>11 the contrary, Katz  held, as relevant here, that the procedural antecedents to a search \nthat the Constitution requires apply even where new technologies make accessible \nplaces and information not o therwise obtainable without a physical intrusion.   389 \nU.S. at 359.   While cameras  might  be generally available and now commonly used , \nmembers of the  public cannot use  them  to see into a n office, house, or other place not \npublicly visible without the owner’s consent.   \nFinally, Defendant cites  City of Ontario, California v. Quon , 560 U.S. 746  \n(2010), in which the Supreme Court considered the privacy  expectations of \ngovernmental employees in communications made on electronic equipment  that the \nemployer  owns .  T here, t he Court observed that rapid changes related to \ncommunications were evident in both the technology and “what society accepts as \nproper behavior” and noted that the “operational realities of the workplace” might \nbear on the reason ableness of employees’ expectation of privacy.   Id. at 756– 59.  But \nQuon arose within the  particular context of the employment relationship .  Although \nthe truism that technological change affects the degree of privacy that society accepts \nas reasonable has  broader application, Quon  and the cases that followed it have not \nextended this principle beyond the employment context.  Any decision to do so \nproperly lies with another court , particularly if doing so pares back constitutional \nprotections across differe nt areas of the law .   \nFollowing Katz , Fourth Amendment jurisprudence examines an individual’s \nexpectation of privacy in a particular place .  The ubiquity  of a particular  technolog y \nor its application s does not directly bear on that analysis .  Here, the room  scan Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  11 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>12 occurred in Plaintiff’s house, in his bedroom, in fact .  At the Fourth Amendment’s \n“very core” lies “ the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from \nunreasonable governmental intrusion.”  Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. 1, 6 (2013) \n(citing Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511 (1961) ).  Consistent with \nestablished precedent, the Court determines that Plaintiff  had an objectively \nreasonable expectation of privacy in his home—and one that society recognizes as \nreasonable .  \nI.B. Searches Under Wyman  v. James  \nAdditionally , Defendant  contends that the room  scans are not “searches” \nbecause they are limited in scope, conducted for a regulatory or administrative \npurpose, and not coerced.   (ECF No. 29 , PageID #46 2–66.)  In support of the \nproposition that these attributes remove the room  scans from the ambit of the Fourth \nAmendment, Defendant relies on Wyman v. James , 400 U.S. 309 (1971) , and its \nprogeny.  \n In Wyman , the Supreme C ourt considered whether a welfare beneficiary may \nrefuse a home visit by her  caseworker without risking the termination of benefits.  \n400 U.S. at 310.   The Wyman Court specifically considered the heightened  protection \nthe Fourth Amendment affords to the privacy of the home  and noted that “one’s  \nFourth Amendment protection subsists apart from his being suspected of criminal \nbehavior .”  Id. at 316 (citing Camara v. Municipal Ct ., 387 U.S. 523, 528– 30 (1967)) .  \nNonetheless, t he Court held  that this “protective  attitude” in the law was not a factor \nin the case because the home visit was not a search in the Fourth Amendment sense .  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  12 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>13 Id. at 318.  Though  State law made the visit mandatory for continu ing benefits  and \nthe visit served both rehabilitative and investiga tive purposes , the Court concluded  \nthat the visit could not be equated with a search in the traditional criminal law \ncontext.  Id.   Indeed , the visit was not forced or compelled, the beneficiary’s denial of \npermission was not a criminal ac t, and if the beneficiary did  not consent then the \nvisitation did not occur and the aid “merely cease [d].”  Id. \n The other cases Defendant cites stem from Wyman .  In S.L. v. Whitburn, 67 \nF.3d 1299, 1307 (7th Cir. 1995) , and Sanchez v. C ity of San Diego , 464 F.3d 916, \n920– 23 (9th Cir. 2006) , the Seventh and Ninth Circuit s noted  that they were bound \nby Wyman  and held  that home visits made pursuant to the administration of welfare \nbenefits  were not searches under the Fourth Amendment.   See also  Schmid v. City of \nSonoma , No. 19 -cv-00883, 2021 WL 1118077, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2021)  \n(upholding denial of an exemption for refusal to consent to a permit -related inspection \non the grounds that the inspections were not Fourth Amendment searches unde r \nWyman ).  Similarly, in Marcavage v. Borough of Lansdowne, P ennsylvania , 493 F. \nApp’x 301 (3d Cir. 2012) , the court upheld an ordinance  authorizing denial of a rental \nlicense if the property owner refused to consent to an inspection .  The Third Circuit \nreasoned that the ordinance “requires a limited search by the city official for the \nspecific purpose of receiving a benefit under the law,”  which is constitutional under \nWyman .  Id.  at 306.  \n Based on Wyman ’s differentiation between investigations and Fourth \nAmendment searches, Defendant advances several reasons why its room  scans of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  13 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>14 students’ homes are not searches.  First, Defendant conducted the scan for the \nregulatory purpose of protecting exam integrity , not for any purpose related to \ncriminality.  ( ECF No. 29 , PageID #463.)  Second, the scan was not coerced because \nPlaintiff was free to object to the scan or refuse to perform it.  ( Id.)  A student who \nrefused to conduct the exam could still take the tes t, and e ven if failure to conduct \nthe scan resulted in not getting credit for the exam, that consequence is  less severe \nthan the loss of  welfare benefits in Wyman .  (Id., PageID #464– 65.)  Third, the scan \nwas limited in scope because it was brief , only rev ealed items in plain view , and the \nstudent controlled the inspection to the extent that the student chose where in the \nhouse to take the exam and where in the room to direct the camera  during the scan.  \n(Id., PageID #463– 64.)  Defendant argues that the room  scan was less intrusive than \nthe home visits in Wyman  because no State officer physically entered Plaintiff’s home, \nDefendant told Plaintiff of the scan two hours in advance, and Plaintiff could choose the part of the home  to be inspected and remove any  private matters from plain view.  \n(Id., PageID #464. )   \n Plaintiff responds that Defendant overreads Wyman .  (ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#500.)   Plaintiff points to the Sixth Circuit’s holding in Andrews v. Hickman County, \nTennessee , 700 F.3d 845 (6th Cir. 2012).  There, the court considered whether social \nworkers who conducted a warrantless home visit in a child abuse investigation were \nentitled to qualified immunity.  The Sixth Circuit noted that the Fourth Amendment’s restrictions on  unreasonable searches extended to the “activities of civil as well as \ncriminal authorities.”  Id. at 858– 59 (citing New Jersey v. T.L.O ., 469 U.S. 325, 335 Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  14 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>15 (1985) ).  Describing case law from other circuits , the c ourt referenced a case in which \nthe Ninth Circuit declined to exempt social workers investigating allegations of child \nabuse from the Fourth Amendment by distinguishing Wyman as mak ing “receipt of \na requested welfare benefit contingent on the grant of entr y for a search intended to \nconfirm that the monies were being used in the recipient child ’s interest, where the \nentry under the state program was of a limited and consensual nature, and the \nrequirement applied to all recipients .”  Id.  at 859 (citing Calabretta v. Floyd , 189 F.3d \n808, 816 (9th Cir. 1999) ).  “Given the presumption that state actors are governed by \nthe Fourth Amendment and the sanctity of the home under the Fourth Amendment,” \nthe Sixth Circuit held  that social workers were governed by the Four th Amendment’s \nwarrant requirement.   700 F.3d at 859.  \n Plaintiff argues that Andrews shows that Wyman did not create a Fourth \nAmendment exception for civil authorities.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #501.)   Rather, \nlongstanding  precedent establishes that the Fourt h Amendment applies to searches \nconducted for noncriminal purposes , especially in the home.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#501– 02.)  Further, Plaintiff maintains that it is well  establishe d that the Fourth \nAmendment applies to all intrusions into a private home, however limited.  ( Id., \nPageID #50 2–03.)  Defendant does not dispute that the Fourth Amendment  gives \nheightened protection to  the home or that the Fourth Amendment applies in \nnoncriminal matters.  ( ECF No. 35 , PageID #533.)   However, Defendant argues  that \nthe Wyman Court considered both of those points and , nonetheless , determined that \nno Fourth Amendment search occurred.  ( Id.) Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  15 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>16  Wyman  dates to 1971,  more than fifty years ago .  Since then, society, \ntechnology, and Fourth Ame ndment jurisprudence have changed markedly.  In the \ncases applying Wyman on which Defendant relies , courts applied Wyman in the \ncontext of upholding termination or denial of a benefit following the beneficiary’s \nrefusal to consent to an inspection, where r efusal triggered no penalties except the \ntermination or denial of benefits.  In this respect, the Sixth Circuit’s decision in \nAndrews, quoting Calabretta from the Ninth Circuit, accurately reads this line of \ncases as applying to a fairly distinct set of ci rcumstances materially different than \nthose at issue here :  making welfare benefits contingent, for all recipients, on a \nlimited and consensual search to confirm expenditure of the funds for the interest of a child.  In contrast , unlike Wyman  and its proge ny, this case involves the privilege \nof college admission and attendance and does not involve a benefit made available to \nall citizens as of right.  Additionally, the record here shows a variable policy —\nenforced , unevenl y, in the discretion of a combination of proctors and professors —of \nusing remote scans that make a student’s home visible , including to other students , \nwith uncertain consequences .   \n Finally, the Court addresses Plaintiff ’s argument that New Jersey v. T.L.O. , \n469 U.S. 325 (1985), provides the proper standard for  the constitutionality of searches \nthat school officials  conduct .  (ECF No. 33\n, PageID #503.)  In  T.L.O. , the Supreme \nCourt  held that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches by school officials , with \nsome accommodation to respond to the needs of the educational environment and \nassess the legality of those searches .  Id.  at 341– 42.  But T.L.O. does not speak to the Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  16 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>17 threshold question of when a school official’s actions constitute a search within the \nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment.   Accordingly, the Court need  not address T.L.O.  \non this question.    \n* * * \n For these reasons, the Court concludes that the Fourth Amendment applies to \nthe virtual room scans Cleveland State uses.  Holding otherwise, as Defenda nt \nargues, raises even more difficult questions about what legal standard, if any, governs \nthe scans and the potential consequences of such a ruling in other areas of life  and \nthe law  that technology touches.  \nII.  Fourth Amendment Reasonableness \n The Fourt h Amendment proscribes only those searches that are unreasonable.  \nHaving held  that the room  scans are searches for purposes of  the Fourth Amendment, \nthe Court turns to whether the scans a re reasonable.   Whether a particular search \nmeets the reasonableness standard “is judged by balancing its intrusion on the \nindividual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate \ngovernmental interests.”  Skinner v. Railway Labor Execs. ’ Ass’n , 489 U.S . 602, 619 \n(1989) (quoting Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648,  654 (1979) ).  Alt hough the Fourth \nAmendment mandates that no warrant may issue except on a showing of probable \ncause, that requirement is not absolute.   A warrant is not required in every case.   \nNational Treasury Emps. Union v. Von Raab , 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989) .  As the text \nof the Fourth Amendment makes clear, the Constitution protects against \nunreasonable  searches and seizures, making reasonableness the ultimate touchstone Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  17 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>20 829–30 (citing Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J , 515 U.S. at 656).  In this context, \nreasonableness under t he Fourth Amendment is informed by the status of students \nas “unemancipated minors” who “have been committed to the temporary custody of \nthe State as schoolm aster.”  Id.  at 654.  In short, under this line of cases, minor \nstudents subject to compulsory school attendance have a lesser privacy interest.  \nIn contrast, Mr. Ogletree was an adult at the time of the search at issue and \nenrolled at Cleveland State by ch oice.  Although this setting might affect the nature \nof the privacy interest at stake to some degree, it is difficult to see how enrollment in \na higher educational institution would limit the core protections of the home under \nthe Fourth Amendment on the f acts and circumstances of this case.   \nII.B.  Character of the Intrusion  \n On the record presented, this analysis encompasses several considerations.  \nFirst, by enrolling in classes at Cleveland State, Mr. Ogletree necessarily traded away \nsome privacy for the privilege and for other goods , such as the opportunity to earn \neducational credentials or to interact with other students or faculty .  Of course, he \nretained his constitutional rights.  See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist ., \n393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969).  In normal times, a student might be able to choose another \ncollege or among classes with different options for tests and assessments.  A student \nwho valued privacy more might opt for courses with in -person tests, while another \nwho prefers conven ience might tolerate an intrusion of the sort at issue here.  \nCleveland State’s policies and practices make such choices and tradeoffs opaque, at \nbest.  Faculty members have discretion on how to implement remote testing.   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  20 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>21 Moreover, b ecause of the pandemic , such choices were not available.  The \nrecord establishes that Mr. Ogletree  did not have the option of attending in -person \nclasses at the time of the room scan.  In other words, enrollment in online courses \nwas Plaintiff’s only option to continue to pursu e his education at Cleveland State.   \nMoreover, in Mr. Ogletree’s case, the professor changed the policy shortly after the start of the course.   As a result, Plaintiff reasonably believed he would not be subject \nto a room scan until approximately two hours before the time of his test.  \nBut the room scan at issue was minimally intrusive.  It is undisputed that the \nscan occurred over an exceedingly short period of time, and Plaintiff had discretion \nover where to direct the camera  in his room , as well as some warning to take steps to \nprotect his priva cy and ensure that the confidential materials he had were not readily \nin view .  On the other hand, other students can see the room scans.  Further, the \n“Fourth Amendment’s protection of the home has never been tied to measurement of \nthe quality or quantity of information obtained.”  Kyllo , 533 U.S. at 35.  Although the \nintrusion at issue might not strike a person  as especially problematic , particularly in \nthe nascent Zoom era, the core protection afforded to the home, the lack of options, \ninconsistency in application of the policy, and short notice of the scan weigh in \nPlaintiff’s favor.  “ It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least \nrepulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional pract ices get their first footing \nin that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of \nprocedure. ”  Silverman , 365 U.S. at 512 (quoting Boyd v. United States , 116 U.S. 616, \n635 (1886) ).   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  21 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>22 II.C.  Government al Interests  \n Defendant ar gues that the room scams facilitate proctoring of tests and ensure \nacademic fairness and integrity.  ( ECF No. 29 , PageID #467.)   These practices help \ndetect other people or unauthorized study aids present in the room  which might  \nimproperly assist the exami nee and deter examinees  from availing themselves of \nthese and other forms of  unauthorized assistance .  (Id., PageID #460; ECF No. 34 , \nPageID #51 8.)  On this point, Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendant has a legitimate \npurpose in preserving the integrity of its test s.  (ECF No. 30 , PageID #490; ECF \nNo. 36, PageID #545 .)  The se considerations weigh in favor of Defendant.  \nII.D.  Efficacy of Means  \n Plaintiff argues that room scans are not necessary to preserve test integrity.  \n(ECF No. 30 , PageID #490.)   Plaintiff points to other procedural safeguards at \nDefendant’s disposal to guard against cheating  and ensure academic integrity .  \nSpecifically, these safeguards include employing proctors to monitor for suspicious \nmovement or  using proctoring programs  that perform functions like preventing \nstudents from accessing the internet or other programs during the test, recording \nstudents during tests , and using artificial intelligence to detect suspicious movement  \nor plagiarism.   (Id., PageID #491– 92.)  \nFurthe r, Plaintiff argues that room scans have  minimal value for preserving \ntest integrity  because there are numerous ways students could cheat that they would \nnot catch .  (Id. , PageID #492.)  For instance, students could access their cell phones \nor notes in another room, since Defendant does not require students to remain on camera for the duration of the test.  (Id., PageID #493 .)  Also, Plaintiff notes  that Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  22 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>23 Defendant does not require a room s can; rather, the decision is left to individual \nfaculty in their discretion —a policy that acknowledges that such means are not \nstrictly necessary , but one available option among many .  (Id. , PageID #490– 91.)   \nDefendant counters that Plaintiff’s proposed a lternatives would not fulfill the \ndetecti on and deterrent functions that room scans  do.  (ECF No. 34 , PageID #519.)   \nRegarding proctoring programs, Defendant argues that they are not  effective at \nachieving these purposes and that sometime s they are inappro priate for students \nwith disabilities.  ( Id.; see ECF No. 34 -1, PageID #523– 24.) \nThough reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment does not require \nemployin g the least intrusive means,  Earls, 536 U.S. at 837, the efficacy of the means \nDefendant has chosen to advance its purpose is a factor in determining \nreasonable ness.  Without question, other procedural safeguards would advance the \nsame purpose s—indeed, Cleveland State employs some of them.  Also, pedagogica l \nalternatives  to tests for assessing students , for instance, a final project or paper , \nmight minimize or eliminate the need for remote scans .  Plaintiff points to several \nways in which students may cheat regardless of the use of room scans .  Besides \npoint ing to the potential deterrent effect, Defendant does not offer much argument or \nevidence to support the efficacy of room scans.   Perhaps experience with room scans \nis too recent or not extensive enough to offer much in this regard.  Whatever the case, a record of s poradic and discretionary use of room scans does not permit a finding \nthat rooms scans are truly, and uniquely, effective at preserving test integrity.   \nAccordingly, this factor weighs in Plaintiff’s favor  too. Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  23 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>24 * * * \n Based on consideration of these factors, individually and collectively, the Court \nconcludes that Mr. Ogletree’s privacy interest in his home outweighs Cleveland \nState’s interests in scanning his room.  Accordingly, the Court determines that \nCleveland State’s practice of conducting room scans is unreasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES  Defendant’s motion for \nsummary judgment and GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion.  The Court DIRECTS  counsel \nto confer on the appropriate next steps , including on the propriety of entering a \ndeclaratory judgment or injunction  and the proper scope for either,  and to submit a \nshort joint status report no later than September 12, 2022.  \n SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   August 22, 2022 \n  \nJ.

Defendant Perrigo Company, Inc. \n(“Perrigo”) removed the case to this Court on March 4, 2021  and filed a motion to \ndismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction u nder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n12(b)( 1) and failure to state a claim  under Rule 12(b)(6 ) on March 11, 2021 .  \nDefendant Northstar Rx, LLC (“Northstar”) also filed a motion to dismiss  for lack \nof jurisdiction  on March 11, 2021 .  The remaining defendants —the Central \nIntelligence Agency (“CIA”), the National Security Agency (“NSA”), the United \nStates A ir Force (“Air Force”), the United States A rmy (“Army”) , and the United Case: 4:21-cv-00275-RWS   Doc. #:  22   Filed: 05/17/21   Page: 1 of 9 PageID #: <pageID>2 \n States Navy  (“Navy”) —filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) on March 16, 2021.1  \nEach of the motions to dismiss emphasized the confusing, unclear nature of \nSilva’s complaint.  Because he is proceeding pro se in this case, I issued an order \ngranting him the opportunity to file an amended complaint.  After he did not file an \namended comp laint by the deadline, I issued another order informing Silva of his \nright to file a reply in opposition to Defendants’ motions to dismiss.  He did not file \na reply brief .  I will grant the Defendants’ motions for the reasons explained below.  \nBACKGROUND  \n Silva’s complaint —which he claims the government instructed him to file “to \nstand up for the rights of everyone” —is difficult to decipher .  It is nearly twenty -\nthree pages long, single -spaced , and filled with meandering, often unintelligible \nallegations .  It contains  details about Silva’s  life and  personal relationships, as well \nas references to politics , historical events, and the ongoing pandemi c.  The main \nallegations in the complaint concern  prescription drugs and wireless torture .   \n Silva alleges that the prescription drugs he has been taking, including \namphetamine and testosterone produced by  Northstar and Perrigo, are fake.  He \nclaims that Northstar and Perrigo “are not the only offenders” and that other \n \n1 Collectively, these defendants will be referred to as “the Federal Agencies.”  Silva did not serve \nthe Army, Navy, Air Force, or CIA.  Counsel received notice of the suit from Perrigo’s counsel.  Case: 4:21-cv-00275-RWS   Doc. #:  22   Filed: 05/17/21   Page: 2 of 9 PageID #: <pageID>3 \n pharmaceutical companies also distribute fake drugs.  He alleges that the Army and \nthe CIA are involved in the production and dissemination of these fake drugs and \nclaims that they are either “instructing these companies or hacking their machines to \nproduce fake drugs and then telepo rting the testosterone after it gets to the pharmacy \nout of the oil it is suspended in.”   \nSilva  also alleges that the Army, Navy, Air Force, and CIA have been \ntorturing him wirelessly for multiple years  and that the NSA has participated by \ndemonstrat ing “tacit compliance…in allowing torture programs to continue and \ndrugs to be faked.”   The torture, which has been “induced wirelessly via interaction \nwith radio waves and nanotechnology,” has included forcing Silva to “grab [his ] \nprivate parts for multiple hours straight as they squeezed them and shocked them \nremotely ,” manipulating  his blood pressure , asphyxiating  him, forcing  him to watch \npornographic videos of his ex -girlfrien d “over [his] eyeballs ,” making him anxious,  \nand causing  him to feel so tired that he is unable to brush his teeth .2  According to \nSilva, the agencies  have also, among other things, “teleport[ed] all of the sugar out \nof [his] soda and the carbonation out of [his] beer,” manipulated his weight so that \nthe scale shows that he weighs more than he actually does , faked his hormone levels , \n \n2 The complaint explains that the technology  used to accomplish this torture includes “voice to \nskull radiotechnology claiming to be from the US military and CIA, teleportation, geolocation \nspoofing, pairing and interfacing of artificial intelligence psychosomatic communication, and the \nfaking of dr ugs and hacking of chemistry machines which measure ingredients in drugs in addition \nto the hacking of weight scales.”  Case: 4:21-cv-00275-RWS   Doc. #:  22   Filed: 05/17/21   Page: 3 of 9 PageID #: <pageID>4 \n and “mind control[ed] [his] mother to try to take guardianship of [him] and make \n[him] drop out of medical school last semester.”   \nFor relief, Silva  requests “legitimate”  drugs , an offer to join the U.S. Army \nafter finishing medical school, and $100,00 0.00.  He would alternatively accept \n$80,000 for a contract to join th e Army after he graduates from medical school .3  \nLEGAL STANDARD S \nRule 12(b)(1)  \nThe party invoking subject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing \nthat the case is properly in federal court.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. \n555, 561 (1992) ( citations  omitted).  This means satisfying the statutory \nrequirements und er 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question cases) or 28 U.S.C. § 1332 \n(diversity cases), in addition to the constitutional requirements  for standing .  If a \ncourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction, it must dismiss the case.  ABF Freight Sys., \nInc. v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters , 645 F.3d 954, 958 (8th Cir. 2011).  \nRule 12(b)(6)  \nIn ruling on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), I must accept as true all \nfactual allegations in the complaint and view them in the light most favorable to the \n \n3 Apparently, Silva has previously applied to “the armed forced [sic] [more than]  16 times, the \nCIA two to four times, and the FBI once ” but “received no call back from any of them.”   He alleged \nthat they did “not allow [him] a waiver to pass the duck walk at the MEPS examination center in \ndowntown St. Louis or in Redding, California.”  Case: 4:21-cv-00275-RWS   Doc. #:  22   Filed: 05/17/21   Page: 4 of 9 PageID #: <pageID>5 \n plaintiff .  Hager v. Ark. Dep’t of Health , 735 F.3d 1009, 1013 (8th Cir. 2013).  The \nfederal rules require only a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \npleader is entitled to relief. ” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) .  To survive a motion to dismiss, \na plaintiff need not provide “detailed factual allegations” but must provide \n“sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible \non its face.”   Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  \nPro Se Pleading Standard  \nBecause Silva is a pro se litigant, his complaint is entitled to liberal \nconstruction .  However, he “ still must  allege sufficient facts to support the claims \nadvanced.” Stone v. Harry , 364 F.3d 912, 914 (8th Cir. 2004) .  See also Martin v. \nAubuchon , 623 F.2d 1282, 1286 (8th Cir. 1980) (“Although we view pro se \npleadings liberally, such pleadings may not be merely conclusory: the complaint \nmust allege facts, which if true, state a claim as a matter of law”) (citations omitted).  \nANALYSIS  \n1. Perrigo and North star \nPerrigo and Northstar argue that this Court lacks jurisdiction over Silva’s  \nclaims under 28 U.S.C. § 1915  because “federal courts are without power to entertain \nclaims otherwise within their jurisdiction if they are so attenuated and unsubstantial \nas to be  absolutely devoid of merit, wholly unsubstantial, [or] obviously frivolous.”  \nHagans v. Lavine , 415 U.S. 528, 536 -37 (1974)  (citations and internal quotation Case: 4:21-cv-00275-RWS   Doc. #:  22   Filed: 05/17/21   Page: 5 of 9 PageID #: <pageID>6 \n marks omitted) .  However, because all of the defendants have filed motions to \ndismiss in response  to the complaint , I will review  Silva’s claims under Rule \n12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) rather than conducting  frivolity review under  § 1915 .  \nSee Williams v. White , 897 F.2d 942, 943 -44 (8th Cir. 1990) (“Dismissals under \nsection 1915 are to be made early in the proceedings, before  service of process on \nthe defendant and before  burdening a defendant with the necessity of making a \nresponsive answer under the rules of civil procedure.”).    \nIt is unclear that th is case is properly in federal court, since  the complaint \ngives no indication  that the requirements for either diversity o r federal question \njurisdiction  have been satisfied .  Assuming that  jurisdiction exist s, the complaint \ndoes not state “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 , 570 (2007).  Reading t he complaint in \nthe light most favorable to Silva , he appears to allege that the drug companies and \nthe federal government have entered into a  conspiracy to supply consumers with \nfake drugs.  There are no specific factual allegations offered in support of this \nconclusion , beyond the assertion that Silva has taken fake prescription drugs \nproduced by Perrigo and Northstar .  Even assuming that this is  true, it is not clear \nfrom the complaint that Perrigo and Northstar actually caused the injuries of which \nSilva complains,  given his allegation that the Army and  the CIA “are instructing \nthese companies or hacking their machines to produce fake drugs and then Case: 4:21-cv-00275-RWS   Doc. #:  22   Filed: 05/17/21   Page: 6 of 9 PageID #: <pageID>7 \n teleporting the testosterone after it gets to the pharmacy out of the oil it is suspended \nin.”  As a r esult, the complaint does not contain “factual content that allows the court \nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant [s] [are]  liable for the misconduct \nalleged .”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 .  \nAdditionally, as Perrigo points out in its motion to dis miss, a plaintiff alleging \nfraud or mistake must “state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud \nor mistake” to survive a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).  “Highly \nspecific allegations” are not required under Rule 9(b) .  Abels v . Farmers \nCommodities Corp. , 259 F.3d 910, 921 (8th Cir. 2001).  However, “conclusory \nallegations that a defendant’s conduct was fraudulent and deceptive are not sufficient \nto satisfy the rule.”   Schaller Telephone Co. v. Golden Sky Sy s., Inc. , 298 F.3d 736, \n746 (8th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).  Because Silva has not satisfied this \nheightened pleading standard, I will dismiss his claims against Perrigo and \nNorthstar.   \n2. Federal Agencies  \nThe Federal Agencies  contend that this Court lacks subjec t matter  jurisdiction \nover this case because  it appears that Silva  has attempted to allege tort claims  against \nthem  that fall within the purview of the Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”).  They \nfurther contend that even if jurisdiction exists, Silva’s claims  against them must be \ndismissed under Rule 12(b)(6).  Case: 4:21-cv-00275-RWS   Doc. #:  22   Filed: 05/17/21   Page: 7 of 9 PageID #: <pageID>8 \n Reading the complaint in the light most favorable to Silva, I agree that the \nclaims are most fairly interpreted as attempted tort claims .  Under the FTCA, a \nplaintiff can sue the federal government in f ederal court for “injury or loss of \nproperty, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or \nomission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his \noffice o r employment.”  28 U.S.C. § 1346 (b)(1).  However, t he FTCA  only \nauthorizes suits against the United States; it  does not permit  suits against federal \nagencies .  Duncan v. Dep’t of Labor , 313 F.3d 445, 447 (8th Cir. 2002).  \nFurthermore, before filing an FTCA claim, a plaintiff must fulfill the administrative \npresentment  requirements set forth at 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a) .  There is no indication \nthat Silva presented his claims to any of the Federal Agencies  before filing suit.  See \nBellecourt v. United States , 994 F.2d 427, 430  (8th Cir. 1993)  (“Presentment of an \nadministrative claim is jurisdictional and must be pleaded and proven by the FTCA \nclaimant.”) (citations omitted).  As a result, it appears that this case is not properly \nbefore the Court.  \nEven if Silva did not intend to bring tort claims against the Federal Agencies , \nit is impossible to determine any other cause of action from which his claims could \narise .  His allegations against the Federal Agencies  are as vague, conclus ory, and \nconspiratorial  as his allegations against Perrigo and Northstar .  Because the \ncomplaint fails “to give the [defendants] fair notice of the nature and basis or grounds Case: 4:21-cv-00275-RWS   Doc. #:  22   Filed: 05/17/21   Page: 8 of 9 PageID #: <pageID>9 \n \nfor a claim, and a general indication of the type of litigation involved ,”  Hopkins v. \nSaunders , 199 F.3d 968, 973 (8th Cir. 1999), I will dismiss Silva’s claims again st \nthe Federal Agencies .  \n Accordingly,  \n IT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that Defendants’ motions to dismiss, [8], [12], \nand [15], are GRANTED .   \n  \n \n  \nRODNEY W.

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nThe court case involves Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society (PTK) and HonorSociety.org, competing honor societies, wherein PTK obtained a preliminary injunction against HonorSociety.org for disseminating misleading information, partially using generative artificial intelligence to create misleading content online. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the injunction issued by the district court, as it was deemed overbroad and a violation of the First Amendment by compelling speech and constituting a prior restraint.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe key legal issue is whether the district court's injunction against HonorSociety.org constituted an overbroad prior restraint on free speech and whether it impermissibly compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe Court of Appeals held that the district court's injunction was overbroad and constituted an impermissible compelled speech, violating the First Amendment. Consequently, the injunction was vacated and the case remanded to the district court.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation:\nImagine two clubs at your college, Club A and Club B, that both want to have as many members as possible. Club A told the court that Club B was spreading lies about them online to get more members, even using computer programs to create tons of fake info. Club A got a judge to order Club B not to do this, but another judge higher up said, \"Wait! That order was too strict and violated Club B's rights to free speech.\" So, they sent the case back to the first judge to think about again.",

Because we agree with HonorSociety that \nthe injunction is overbroad and compels speech in violation of the First Amendment, we VACATE  the injunction and REMAND  to the district \ncourt.   \nI \nThis case involves two honor societies that compete in the \ncommunity- college honor -society market.  Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society \n(“PTK”), founded in 1918, provides academic - and professional -focused \nmembership services to community college students across  the county.  \nHonorSociety, founded in 2014 by Michael Moradian, has a similar mission, and has become PTK’s largest competitor.   \nIn 2022, PTK sued HonorSociety asserting claims under the Lanham \nAct for trademark and trade -dress infringement  and Mississippi state -law \nclaims for  unfair competition  and trade -dress infringement.  It later added \nseveral claims, including Mississippi state -law claims for tortious \ninterference with contract and with prospective business advantage.  HonorSociety asserted several counterclaims against PTK  and third -party \nclaims against Dr. Lynn Tincher -Ladner, PTK’s chief executive officer.\n1   \nIn March  2024, PTK obtained a preliminary injunction that enjoined  \nHonorSociety from circulating six survey questions that contained \n“misleading” information to PTK members and from soliciting  information \non PTK from college campuses.   \n_____________________  \n1 Because Dr. Tincher -Ladner joined PTK’s request for the preliminary injunction \nthat is at issue here, any reference to PTK in this opinion refers to both PTK and Dr. \nTincher -Ladner.   Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n3 A few months later, PTK again requested a preliminary injunction, \nthis time  on the basis that HonorSociety had continued to disseminate \nmisleading claims against PTK, albeit in new ways.  PTK claimed that \nHonorSociety had used generative artificial intelligence to create approximately 5,000 website s and articles to “mislead readers about the \nlawsuit” ; spread misinformation about a former PTK chapter advisor and the \norganization’s former executive director,  Rod Risley;  created a “Directory” \nof PTK chapters t hat actually redirected users to HonorSociety’s websites ; \nedited PTK’s Wikipedia page ; and circulated a cartoon image of an “East \nAsian woman,” which, according to the district court’s findings, depicted Dr. Tincher- Ladner.  The district court later held an evidentiary hearing on \nthe motion in June 2024 and granted the motion two months later , finding \nthat PTK was likely to succeed on its Mississippi state law claim for tortious \ninterference .   \nThe district court’s injunction was sweeping .  It prohibited  \nHonorSociety from engaging in several forms of online speech targeted at \nPTK  and ordered it to include a disclaimer on any website or social media \npost that referenced the pending litigation .  The injunction states:  \n1) Immediately cease edits to PTK’s Wikipedia page, and subject \nitself to discovery  on Wikipedia edits it may have made or caused \nduring this litigation.  \n2) Remove all images of the cartoon East Asian woman vendor from its webpages  and social media posts.  \n3) Remove all false subject matter from its webpages and social media \nposts  regarding the Itawamba Community College chapter \nadvisor’s arrest.  \n4) Limit its reporting on the sexual harassment allegations against \nRisley to existing media articles only, rather than articles of its own \ncreation.  \n5) Add the actual contact information for every PTK chapter into the \n“Directory,” or  delete the “Directory.”   Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n4 6) Add the following disclaimer, in 12 point or larger size font, to the \ntop of all remaining webpages and social media posts that concern \nor reference this  litigation:  \nDisclaimer: The author of this article is not a neutral party in \nthe referenced litigation. HonorSociety.org Inc., Honor \nSociety Foundation  Inc., and its president Michael Moradian \nwere sued in federal court by  PTK on April 20, 2022 for False \nDesignation of Origin, Trade Dress  Infringement, and Unfair \nCompetition. Honor Society and Michael  Moradian \ncountersued and are presently defendants/counter -plaintiffs  in \nthis litigation. Litigation is still ongoing and all claims made  \nregarding this case are just alle gations against the parties.  \n HonorSociety then timely appealed the second injunction.  On appeal, \nit argues  that:  (1) the district court erred in concluding that PTK was \nsubstantially likely to succeed on the merits of its claims for tortious \ninterference , (2) the injunction is an overbroad and vague prior restraint, and \n(3) the injunction compels speech in violation of the First Amendment.  \nBecause we conclude that this injunction is both overbroad and impermissibl y compels speech, we pretermit discussion of HonorSociety’s \nlikelihoo d of success on the merits . \nII \nCourt orders that forbid speech activities are “classic examples of \nprior restraints.”   Alexander v. United States , 509 U.S. 544, 550  (1993) .  Prior \nrestraints  “face a well -established presumption against their \nconstitutionality. ”  United States v. Brown , 218 F.3d 415, 424 –25 (5th Cir. \n2000) ).  “The first step in assessing the constitutionality of a prior restraint \nrequires considering whether the harm the court seeks to prevent justifies the restraint on speech. ”  Marceaux v. Lafayette City- Par. Consol. Gov ’t, 731 F.3d \n488, 493 (5th Cir. 2013) .  Further, t he restriction “must be narrowly tailored Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n5 and employ the least restrictive means of preventing the prejudice.”  Id. \nat 492.   \nNeither party disputes that this injunction constitutes a prior \nrestraint.  PTK asserts, however, that the prior restraint is justified  because \nthe district court concluded that HonorSociety’s speech constitute s false \ncommercial speech , which does not enjoy the First Amendment’s full \nprotections .   \nTrue, the  First Amendment  “accords a lesser protection to \ncommercial speech than to other  constitutionally guaranteed expression.”  \nCentral Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, \n563 (1980).  But at its core , commercial speech is speech that “does no more \nthan propose a commercial transaction.”  Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods.  Corp. , \n463 U.S. 60, 66 (1983)  (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).2 \nEdits to PTK’s Wikipedia page cannot, in any sense, be viewed as \n“propos[ing] a commercial transaction.”  Id.   Nor can the cartoon image in \nquestion, which is protected under the First Amendment.  See Bailey v. Iles , \n87 F.4th 275, 283 (5th Cir. 2023) (“The First Amendment’s protections \n_____________________  \n2 Our commercial -speech analysis is guided by the Bolger  factors: “(i) whether the \ncommunication is an advertisement, (ii) whether the communication refers to a specific \nproduct or service, and (iii) whether the speaker has an economic motivation for the \nspeech. ”  Procter & Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp. , 242 F.3d 539, 552 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing \nBolger , 463 U.S. at 67 (internal quotation marks omitted)).   We note that the distinction \nbetween commercial and noncommercial speech is a “matter of degree,” City of Cincinnati \nv. Discovery Network, Inc. , 507 U.S. 410, 423  (1993) , which is ill- suited to a generalized, one -\nsize-fits-all approach.  The record is replete with discrete instances of speech, including \nsocial media posts on LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter), AI -generated websites and \narticles on myriad topics, Wikipedia edits, cartoons, the PTK chapter “Directory,” and more.  Here, the district court concluded that HonorSociety’s “online postings” collectively constituted commercial speech.  On remand, we urge the district court to \nanalyze commercial speech with an increa sed level of granularity.  Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n6 apply to jokes, parodies, satire, and the like, whether clever or in poor \ntaste.”).  \nAssuming arguendo that some of the enjoined speech constitutes \ncommercial speech, the injunction’s sweeping prohibitions are overbroad  \nbecause the injunction also prohibits non -commercial speech and instances \nof speech not found to be prejudicial to PTK .  For example, the district court \nenjoined HonorSociety from making any future edits to PTK’s Wikipedia page —whether true or untrue, prejudicial or innocuous .  It also did not \nidentify any harmful or untrue reporting in HonorSociety’s reporting on Risley.  An injunction must be “ ‘narrowly tailored ’ to excis[e]” only those \nexamples of speech with a sufficient potential for prejudice.  Marceaux , 731 \nF.3d at 494 (vacating injunction that ordered the “takedown” of a website \nwhere only some of the website’s contents caused prejudice).   Because this \ninjunction prohibits speech irrespective of its potential for prejudice, it is \noverbroad.  \nFinally, we conclude that the disclaimer constitutes impermissible \ncompelled speech.  Generally, the government may not compel a person to \nspeak the government’s preferred message.  303 Creative LLC v. Elenis , 600 \nU.S. 570, 586 (2023).  In the context of commercial speech, the government \nmay compel speech if the disclosure is:  (1) purely factual, (2) \nuncontroversial, (3) justified by a legitimate state interest, and (4) not unduly burdensome.  R J Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. FDA, 96 F.4th 863, 877 (5th Cir. 2024) (citing Zauderer v. Off.  of Disciplinary Counsel of Sup.  Ct. of Ohio , 471 \nU.S. 626, 651 (1985)) .  The district court did not analyze whether this \ndisclaimer was uncontroversial, justified by a state interest, or posed undue burdens on HonorSociety.  Further, while PTK asserts that there is a state interest in ensuring an unbiased jury pool, the district court specifically disclaimed any concerns over tainting the jury pool.  Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 04/07/2025No. 24- 60452 \n7 * * * \nIn conclusion, the district court’s injunction is an overbroad prior \nrestraint and impermissibly compels speech.  Accordingly, we VACATE  the \ninjunction and REMAND  to the district court.     Case: 24-60452      Document: 111-1     Page: 7     Date Filed: 04/07/2025",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Kemp v. Beirami, plaintiff Bobby M. Kemp filed a civil rights lawsuit against Ahmad Beirami, alleging that Beirami, while employed at Meta Platforms, Inc., was involved in the creation of an AI system that illegally intercepted Kemp's electronic communications and facial recognition profile. The court denied Kemp's motion to proceed in forma pauperis because he failed to provide the necessary prison trust fund account statement and dismissed the case without prejudice due to the improper filing fee or insufficient support for his IFP application.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff, Bobby M. Kemp, could proceed with his lawsuit without paying the standard filing fee by adequately demonstrating financial incapacity as a prisoner and if he properly established venue in the Southern District of California.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Kemp's motion to proceed in forma pauperis due to failure to submit the required trust fund account statement and dismissed the action without prejudice for not paying the requisite filing fees or providing a properly supported motion to proceed IFP. Additionally, venue was not properly established.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you want to sue someone but don't have enough money to pay the filing fee upfront. There's a rule that if you really can't afford it, you can apply to waive the fee by showing proof of your financial situation. In this case, the person suing didn't give enough information to show he couldn't pay, so the court said, \"You can't move forward with your lawsuit until you either pay the fee or give us the right paperwork.\" Plus, the court said it might not be the right location for the lawsuit, as the person he was suing was in a different place.",

Motion to Proceed  IFP \n All parties instituting any civil action  in a district court of the United States, except \na petition  for writ of habeas corpus, must pay a civil filing fee of $402, and t he action may \nproceed despite a failure to prepay the entire fee o nly if leave to proceed IFP  is granted \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a).2  See 28 U.S.C. § 1914(a) ; Andrews v. Cervantes, 493 \nF.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir.  2007) (“28 U.S.C.  § 1915(a)  allows the district court to waive \nthe fee, for most individuals unable to afford it, by granting IFP status.”)   \nPlaintiffs who wish to proceed IFP must establish their inability to pay the civil filing \nfee by filing an affidavit attesting to their incom e and assets, s ee Escobedo v. Applebees , \n787 F.3d 1226, 1234 (9th Cir. 2015) , which Plaintiff has provided.  ( See ECF No. 2 at 1-\n5.)  However, prisoners seeking leave to proceed IFP are also required to submit a “certified \ncopy of the trust fund account st atement (or institutional equivalent) for . . . the 6 -month \nperiod immediately preceding the filing of the complaint.”  28 U.S.C. §  1915(a)(2); \nAndrews v. King , 398 F.3d 1113, 1119 (9th Cir. 2005) .  From the certified trust account \nstatement, the Court assesses an initial payment of 20% of (a) the average monthly deposits \nin the account for the past six months, or (b) the average monthly balance in the account \nfor the past six months, whichever is greater, unless the prisoner has no assets.   See 28 \nU.S.C. §  1915(b)(1)  & (4).  The institution collects subsequent payments, assessed at 20% \nof the preceding month’s income, in any month in which the  account exceeds $10, and \nforwards those payments to the Court until the entire filing fee is paid.  See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915(b)(2).   Once IFP is granted, Plaintiff remains  obligated to pay the entire fee in \nmonthly  installments regardless of whether the  action is ultimately dismissed.  Bruce v. \nSamuels,  577 U.S. 82, 84 (2016).   \n \n2  In addition to a $350 fee, civil litigants , other than those  granted leave to proceed IFP , \nmust pay an additional administrative fee of $5 2.  See 28 U.S.C. §  1914(a) (Judicial \nConference Schedule of Fees, District Court Misc. Fee Schedule, § 14 (eff. Dec.  1, 2020) ). \n Case 3:23-cv-00832-GPC-AHG   Document 3   Filed 05/19/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 2 of 5 \n3 \n23cv0832 -GPC (AHG)  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  Plaintiff’s IFP application does not contain the required trust fund account statement.  \n(See ECF No. 2.)  T he Court cannot grant his IFP application without the trust fund account \nstatement for the 6-month period immediately preceding the filing of his Complaint .  See \nAndrews , 398 F.3d at 1119 (“ [P]risoners must demonstrate that they are not able to pay the \nfiling fee with an affidavit and submission of their prison trust account records.”), citing \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(1)&(2).  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED  \nand this action is DISMISSE D without prejudice based on Plaintiff’s failure to pay the  \ncivil filing and a dministrative fee or to submit a properly supported m otion  to proceed IFP \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1914(a) & 1915(a).  \nII. Venue  \nIn addition, t he C ourt notes that the Southern District of California may not be the \nproper venue for Plaintiff’s case .  Venue may be raised by the Court sua sponte where the \ndefendant has not yet filed a responsive pleading and the time for doing so has not run.  See \nCostlow v. Weeks , 790 F.2d 1486, 1488 (9th Cir. 1986).   \n“A civil action may be brought in (1) a judicial district in which any defendant \nresides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; [or] (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaim occurred, o r a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is \nsituated . . . .”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b); Costlow , 790 F.2d at 1488; Decker Coal Co. v. \nCommonwealth Edison Co. , 805 F.2d 834, 842 (9th Cir. 1986).  “The district court of a \ndistrict in wh ich is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, \nor if it be in the interests of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.”  28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).      \nPlaintiff  names as the sole Defendant  Ahmad Beirami,  and indicates this  Defendant \nis a citizen of California and works for Meta Platforms, Inc., a company incorporated in California.  (ECF No. 1 at 1.)  None of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s \nclaims are alle ged to have occurred in either San Diego or Imperial County, and no \nDefendant is alleged to reside here.

Conclusion and Order  \n Accordingly, the Court:  \n (1) DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion to proceed IFP without prejudice.  \n (2) DISMISSES  this civil action without prejudice based on Plaintiff’s failure to \npay the civil filing and a dministrative fee or to submit a properly supported motion  to \nproceed IFP pursuant to 28 U.S. C. §§ 1914(a) & 1915(a).  \n (3) GRANTS  Plaintiff  forty -five (45)  days leave from the date this Order is filed \nto: (a) prepay the entire $40 2 civil filing and administrative fee in full; or (b) complete and \nfile a properly supported m otion to proceed IFP whic h includes a certified copy of his  \nprison trust account statement for the 6-month period preceding the filing of his Complaint . \nSee 28 U.S.C. §  1915(a)(2); S.D. Cal. CivLR 3.2(b).   If Plaintiff fails to either pay the $40 2 \ncivil filing fee or submit a prop erly supported m otion to proceed IFP within 45 days, this \naction will remain dismissed without prejudice based solely on hi s failure  to satisfy 28 \nU.S.C. §  1914(a)’s fee requiremen t and without further Order of the Court.  \nThe Court expresses no opinion a t this time a s to whether Plaintiff’s pleading should \nsurvive the sua sponte  screening required by 28 U.S.C. §  1915A.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Bobby M. Kemp v. Heinrich Kuttler, the plaintiff, a prisoner in Florida, accuses the defendant, an employee at Meta Platforms in California, of developing an AI machine that illegally intercepted his electronic communications and facial recognition data. The court denied Kemp's motion to proceed without paying the filing fee because he didn't provide the required financial documentation, and it dismissed the case due to improper venue and failure to prepay filing fees or submit a complete motion for in forma pauperis status.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff could proceed with his civil rights lawsuit without prepaying the filing fee by submitting a motion to proceed in forma pauperis that complies with federal requirements.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the plaintiff's motion to proceed in forma pauperis and dismissed the case without prejudice due to failure to pay the filing fee and improper venue, giving the plaintiff 45 days to correct these deficiencies if he wishes to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A man in jail wanted to sue someone working at Facebook's parent company, claiming that they wrongfully used a machine to spy on him. He asked the court to let him skip paying the fee to start his lawsuit because he couldn't afford it, but didn't provide the needed paperwork. The court said he has to provide that paperwork or pay the fee, and also mentioned that he might be filing his lawsuit in the wrong place. He has a short time to fix these issues if he wants to continue with his case.",

Case No.:  23cv1198 -DMS -AHG  \n \nORDER  DENYING MOTION TO \nPROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS \nAND DISMISSING CIVIL ACTION  \n \n \nBobby M. Kemp  (“Plaintiff”) , a prisoner currently incarcerated at the Holmes \nCorrectional Institution in Bonifay, Florida , proceeding pro se, has filed a civil rights action \naccompanied by a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (“IFP”) .  (ECF No s. 1-2.)  Plaintiff , \na Florida citizen,  alleges that Defendant Heinrich Kuttler , a California citizen, while \nemployed by Meta Platforms, Inc., a company i ncorporated in California, participated in \nthe design and development of an Artificial Intelligence Machine used by Meta to intercept \nPlaintiff’s electronic communications and facial recognition profile in violation of federal \nlaw.  (ECF No. 1 at 2 -4.) \nI. Motion to Proceed  IFP \n All parties instituting any civil action  in a district court of the United States, except \na petition  for writ of habeas corpus, must pay a civil filing fee of $40 2, and t he action may Case 3:23-cv-01198-DMS-AHG   Document 3   Filed 07/17/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 1 of 4 \n2 \n23cv1198 DMS AHG  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 proceed despite a failure to prepay the entire fe e only if leave to proceed IFP is granted \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1915(a).1  See 28 U.S.C. § 1914(a) ; Andrews v. Cervantes , 493 \nF.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir.  2007) (“28 U.S.C.  § 1915(a)  allows the district court to waive \nthe fee, for most individuals unable to afford it, by granting IFP status.”)   \nPlaintiffs who wish to proceed IFP must establish their inability to pay the civil filing \nfee by filing an affidavit attesting to their incom e and assets , see Escobedo v. Applebees , \n787 F.3d 1226, 1234 (9th Cir. 2015) , which Plaintiff has provided.  ( See ECF No. 2 at 1 -\n5.)  However, p risoners seeking leave to proceed IFP are also required to submit a “certified \ncopy of the trust fund account st atement (or institutional equivalent) for . . . the 6 -month \nperiod immediately preceding the filing of the complaint.”  28 U.S.C. §  1915(a)(2); \nAndrews v. King , 398 F.3d 1113, 1119 (9th Cir. 2005) .  From the certified trust account \nstatement, the Court ass esses an initial payment of 20% of (a) the average monthly deposits \nin the account for the past six months, or (b) the average monthly balance in the account \nfor the past six months, whichever is greater, unless the prisoner has no assets.   See 28 \nU.S.C. §  1915(b)(1)  & (4).  The institution collects subsequent payments, assessed at 20% \nof the preceding month’s income, in any month in which the account exceeds $10, and \nforwards those payments to the Court until the entire filing fee is paid.  See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915(b)(2).   Once IFP is granted, Plaintiff remains  obligated to pay the entire fee in \nmonthly  installments regardless of whether the action is ultimately dismissed.  Bruce v. \nSamuels , 577 U.S. 82, 84 (2016).   \n Plaintiff’s IFP application does not contain  the required trust fund account statement.  \n(See ECF No. 2.)  T he Court cannot grant his IFP application without the trust fund account \nstatement for the 6 -month period immediately preceding the filing of his Complaint .  See \n \n1  In addition to a $350 fee, civil litigants , other than those  granted leave to proceed IFP , \nmust pay an additional administrative fee of $5 2.

Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED  \nand this action is DISMISSE D without prejudice based on Plaintiff’s  failure to pay the \ncivil filing and a dministrative fee or to submit a properly supported m otion  to proceed IFP \npursuant to 2 8 U.S.C. §§ 1914(a) & 1915(a).  \nII. Venue  \nIn addition, t he C ourt notes  that the Southern District of California may not be the \nproper venue for Plaintiff’s case .  Venue may be raised by the Court  sua sponte where the \ndefendant has not yet filed a responsive pleading and the time for doing so has not run.  See \nCostlow v. Weeks , 790 F.2d 1486, 1488 (9th Cir. 1986).   \n“A civil action may be brought in – (1) a judicial district in which any defendant \nresides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; [or] (2) a \njudicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaim occurred, o r a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is \nsituated  . . . .”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b); Costlow , 790 F.2d at 1488; Decker Coal Co. v. \nCommonwealth Edison Co. , 805 F.2d 834, 842 (9th Cir. 1986).  “The district court of a \ndistrict in wh ich is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, \nor if it be in the interests of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it \ncould have been brought.”  28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).      \nPlaintiff  names as the sole Defendant  Heinrich Kuttler , and indicates th is Defendant \nis a citizen of California and works for Meta Platforms, Inc., a company incorporated in \nCalifornia.  (ECF No. 1 at 1.)  None of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s \nclaims are a lleged to have occurred in either San Diego or Imperial County, and no \nDefendant is alleged to reside here.  See 28 U.S.C. § 84(d) (“The Southern District of \nCalifornia comprises the counties of Imperial and San Diego.”)  Therefore, Plaintiff has \nnot adequ ately plead that  venue is proper in the Southern  District of Californi a.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, John Doe moved to quash subpoenas issued by Spider Labs to Google and LinkedIn, seeking Doe's identity for a defamation lawsuit. The court granted Doe's motion, finding that Spider Labs did not provide sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case of defamation against Doe's anonymous speech regarding Spider Labs' AI technology claims. The case involved AI as Doe questioned the effectiveness of Spider Labs’ claim of using AI to detect ad fraud.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Spider Labs demonstrated a prima facie case of defamation that would justify revealing John Doe's identity, thereby overcoming Doe's First Amendment right to anonymous speech.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Spider Labs failed to provide competent evidence to prove a prima facie case of defamation. Consequently, the court granted Doe's motion to quash the subpoenas directed at Google and LinkedIn, protecting Doe's anonymity under the First Amendment.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you said something about a company online, and they got upset and wanted to find out who you are so they could sue you. They asked Google and LinkedIn to tell them, but you asked the court to stop this.

No. 1  \n \n \nIn this proceeding, John Doe moves to quash respondent Spider Labs, Ltd.’s (“Spider \nLabs”) subpoenas to Google LLC (“Google”) and LinkedIn Corp.  (“LinkedIn”) .  Dkt. No. 19.  \nThe Court heard oral argument on Doe’s motion on October 27, 2020.  Dkt. No. 24.  At the \nCourt’s reque st, the parties submitted supplemental briefing regarding the application of  collateral \nestoppel and Doe’s right to invoke the First Amendment.  Dkt. Nos. 25, 29, 30.  Having \nconsidered the parties’ papers and the arguments presented  at the hearing, the Co urt grants  Doe’s  \nmotion to quash  and denies his request for attorneys’ fees and costs .  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nThis proceeding arises out of an action Spider Labs filed against Doe  in the Southern \nDistrict of New York, Spider Labs, Ltd. v. Doe , No. 1:20-cv-05457 -LAP  (S.D.N.Y. ).  Spider Labs \nis a Japanese company  that offers products and services intended to combat Internet advertising \nfraud —specifically, activity that artificially inflates the number of “clicks” that online \nadvertisements receive in a pay -per-click advertising arrangement (“Ad Fraud”) .  Dkt. No. 20 -1 ¶¶ \n3, 10.  SpiderAF is Spider Labs’ primary anti -Ad Fraud offering .  Id. ¶ 12.    \nDoe’s true identity is unknown.  He describes himself as  a computer scientist interested  in Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 1 of 18 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  combatting Ad Fraud.  Dkt. No. 19 -1 ¶¶ 4 -5.  Sometime before February 2020, Doe  says he  \ndecided to start a blog to educate  the public about Ad Fraud and misleading advertising practices.  \nDkt. No. 19 -1 ¶¶ 6 -7.  On February 25, 2020, Doe registe red a domain name for the blog and set \nup a Google G Suite Business email subscription using his true identity.  Id. ¶¶ 7-8.  Doe then \nassumed a pseudonym, “Jeff Katzenberg,” for purposes of  his blogging activities , purportedly  to \nprotect  his privacy , to avoid having his activities associated with his employer , and to enhance his \ncredibility as a blogger .  Id. ¶ 9.   \nIn March and April 2020, Doe says he began investigating and preparing potential blog \narticles.  Id. ¶ 11.  On June 10, 2020 , Doe discovered a press release from Spider Labs, then \noperating as Phybbit Ltd. (“Phybbit”).  Id. ¶ 12.  The press release stated, among other things: that \nPhybbit was “the only Asian vendor certified by the international Trustworthy Accountability \nGroup  (TAG)”; that Phybbit was “accredited by the US -based Media Rating Council (MRC)”; and \nthat the SpiderAF product uses artificial intelligence or (“AI”) to detect online advertising fraud.  \nId. ¶ 13, Ex. 3.  Doe was aware of other TAG -certified Asian vendor s besides Phybbit, and he \nbelieved that the statement in the press release that Phybbit was the only one was false and \nmisleading.  Id. ¶ 14.  Based on that belief, he decided to investigate Phybbit’s other claims \nconcerning MRC accreditation and SpiderAF’ s use of AI.  Id. ¶ 15.  \nAccording to Doe, he first searched the MRC’s website and found that Phybbit was not \nlisted as an accredited company.  Id. ¶ 17.  He therefore concluded that Phybbit’s claim about \nMRC accreditation was also false and misleading.  Id.  With respect to Phybbit’s claims about \nSpiderAF, Doe says he contacted a Japanese source in the anti -Ad Fraud industry, who informed \nDoe that the source  understood that Phybbit used a “blacklist”  of IP addresses  to attempt to \nidentify fraud  as opposed t o more sophisticated AI or machine learning techniques.  Id. ¶ 19.  Doe \nthen decided to test the efficacy of SpiderAF by visiting the websites of Phybbit’s customers.  Id. \n¶¶ 19 -29.  Doe says he ran  tests designed to mimic  behavior commonly considered  suspicious  in \nthe anti -Ad Fraud industry, such as using a virtual private network to mask his IP address and an \nemulator to misrepresent the type  of device  being used.  Id. ¶¶ 20, 27 -29.  Even while mimicking \nsuspicious behavior, Doe  found he  was able to continue viewing and clicking on advertisements.

Believing  that any effective  anti-Ad Fraud service should have been able to detect \nhis suspicious behavior a nd block him from accessing the ads, Doe concluded that Phybbit’s \nfailure to do so meant Spider AF  did not work as advertised and could not be “AI-driven.”  Id. ¶¶ \n29-30.   \nDoe says he decided to write a blog article about what he believed were false and \nmisleading statements from  Phybbit .  Id. ¶ 31.  As part of the writing process, he used his Jeff \nKatzenberg  Google  email  account  to contact 13 Phybbit customers on June 14, 2020.1  Id. ¶¶ 31 -\n32, 34.  The emails, which were substantially similar  to one another , stated:  \n \nDear [Phybbit customer contact],  \n \nMy name is Jeff, and I run a new blog about preventing ad fraud.  \nI’m currently running an article about a fraudulent Japanese \ncompany c alled Phybbit/SpiderAF that I believe might have \ncommitted fraud against you and [Phybbit customer name].  \n \nIn my article, I talk about how they tell customers that they are \nMRC accredited, even though they aren’t, and how they claim their \ntechnology is art ificial intelligence based (which it isn’t).  I’m also \ntalking about how they are defrauding their clients, like you guys, \nand how all of their clients aren’t actually protected from fraud. We \nhired a team of engineers to test it out and discovered there’s  \nnothing behind their platform, and ran a bunch of campaigns with \ntheir clients (SSPs and DSPs) and discovered that it couldn’t detect \nfraud.  \n \nI saw a press release saying that you guys are their clients and I \nwanted to interview you, like other people, on  whether or not you \nknew that they aren’t actually MRC accredited even though they \nclaim they are.  \n \nFurthermore, we’re looking to do a massive press release in Japan, \nin Japanese, to expose them.  \n \nAre you perhaps free this week to have a call and provide a  quote \nfor the article?  \n \nBest,  \n \nJeff \n \nId. ¶ 33, Exs. 10 -11; see also Dkt. No. 20 -1, Exs. A -E.  In his email to ValueCommerce, Doe \n \n1 Spider Labs argues that Doe did not actually perform any kind of investigation because its \nrecords indicate that Doe visited the Spider Labs website to identify Spider Labs customers and \nthen sent his emails to them within minutes.

No. 20 (D. Ariz. Nov. 30, 2020 ).   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 governs discovery of non -parties.  The scope of  \nallowable  discovery under  Rule 45 is the s ame as the scope of discovery permitted under Rule \n26(b).  Beaver Cty. Employers Ret. Fund v. Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. , No. 3:16 -mc-80062 -JSC, \n2016 WL 3162218, at *2 (N.D. Cal. June 7, 2016) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 45 advisory comm ’s note \n(1970); Fed. R.  Civ. P. 34(a)).  Rule 26 permits discovery “regarding any non -privileged matter \nthat is relevant to any party’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case \nconsidering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in contr oversy, the \nparties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the \ndiscovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery \noutweighs its likely benefit.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (1).  \nThe Court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery if it determines that: “(i) the \ndiscovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other \nsource that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensiv e; (ii) the party seeking \ndiscovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information by discovery in the action; or (iii) \nthe proposed discovery is outside the scope permitted by Rule 26(b)(1).”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26(b)(2)(C).  Rule 45 further provides th at “the court for the district where compliance is required \nmust quash or modify a subpoena that: (i) fails to allow a reasonable time to comply; (ii) requires \na person to comply beyond the geographical limits specified in Rule 45(c); (iii) requires disclo sure \nof privileged or other protected matter, if no exception or waiver applies; or (iv) subjects a person \nto undue burden.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(3)(A).  \nGenerally, “a party has no standing to seek to quash a subpoena issued to someone who is \nnot a party  to the action, unless the objecting party claims some personal right or privilege with \nregard to the documents sought.”  Drummond Co., Inc. v. Collingsworth , Nos. 13–mc–80169 –JST \n(JCS ), 13–mc–80171 –JST (JCS) , 2013 WL 6074157, at *15 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 18, 2013) (quoting \n9A Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. § 2459 (3d ed. 2008)).  If good \ncause is shown, a court may “issue an order to protect a party or person from annoyance, Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 6 of 18 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  embarrassment, o ppression, or undue burden or expense, including . . . forbidding the disclosure \nor discovery.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1)(A).  \nThe moving party bears the burden of persuasion on a motion to quash, but the party \nissuing the subpoena must demonstrate that th e discovery is relevant .  See Chevron Corp. v. \nDonziger , No. 3:12 -mc-80237 -CRB, 2013 WL 4536808, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 22, 2013) (citation \nomitted); see also Optimize Tech. Solutions, LLC v. Staples, Inc. , No. 5:14 -mc-80095 -LHK, 2014 \nWL 1477651, at *2 (N.D . Cal. Apr. 14, 2014).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nDoe advances several  arguments as to why the Court should quash Spider Labs’ s \nsubpoenas to Google and LinkedIn.  First, Doe contends that the subpoenas should be quashed for \nfailure to comply with Rule 45(d)(3)(A).  Second , Doe says the subpoena s violate the Stored \nCommunications Act.  Third, Doe argues  that because  the subpoenas seek documents revealing his \nidentity , they  violate his First Amendment right to anonymous speech , and that this Court is \ncollaterally estopped by  the District of Arizona’s order quashing the GoDaddy subpoena from \nfinding otherwise .   \nThe Court addresses each argument in turn.  In addition, the Court considers Doe’s request \nfor attorneys’ fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure  § 1987.2(c).    \nA. Rule 45(d)(3)  \nDoe argues that the  Court should quash the  subpoenas for failure to comply with Rule \n45(d)(3)(A).  Dkt. No. 19 at 5 n.1.  Rule 45(d)(3)(A)(ii) provides that the Court must quash or \nmodify a subpoena that requires compliance be yond the geographical limits specified in Rule \n45(c) —i.e., 100 miles from where the subpoenaed party lives or transacts business.  The \nsubpoenas here are directed to Google and LinkedIn .  Google is headquartered in  Mountain View, \nCalifornia, and LinkedIn i s headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, but the subpoena s require \nproduction of documents in Denver, Colorado , well outside the permissible geographic limits .  \nDkt. No. 2, Exs. C -D.   \nSpider Labs does not address this defect in its opposition.  See Dkt. No. 20.  However, at \nthe hearing, Spider Labs conceded that the subpoenas were deficient in this respect  and stated that Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 7 of 18 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  although neither Google nor LinkedIn had objected on this basis, it would stipulate to a place of \nproduction within this District instead .  Dkt. No. 28 at 6:5 –7:25.  Based on this representation, the \nCourt will not quash the subpoenas for failure to comply with Rule 45(d)(3)(A).  \nB. Stored Communications Act  \nDoe also argues  briefly in a footnote  that the  Court should quash the  subpoenas because \nthe disclosures they require would violate  the Stored Communications Act.  Dkt. No. 19 at 5 n.1.  \nDoe does not explain this objection .  As the subpoenas do not seek the content s of any stored \ncommunications associated with the accounts at issue , they do not implicate the prohibitions of the \nStored Communications Act .  See, e.g., Optiver Australia Pty. Ltd. v. Tibra Trading Pty. Ltd. , No. \nC 12 -80242 EJD (PSG), 2013 WL 256771, at *2 –3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 23, 2013) (discussing \nprohibitions of Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. ).  The Court denies Doe’s \nmotion to quash on this ground.  \nC. First Amendment Right to Anonymous Speech  \nThe First Amendment protects the rights of individuals to speak anonymously.  \nWatchtower  Bible & Tract Soc’y of New York v. Village of Stratton , 536 U.S. 150, 166 –67 (2002); \nMcIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n , 514 U.S. 334, 341 –42 (1995).  But that right does not protect \ntortious, defamatory, or libelous speech.  USA Tech s., Inc. v. Doe , 713 F. Supp. 2d 901, 906 (N.D. \nCal. 2010); see also In re Anonymous Online Speakers , 661 F.3d 1168, 1173 (9th Cir. 2011)  (“The \nright to speak, whether anonymously or otherwise, is not unlimited, however, and the degree of \nscrutiny varies depending on the  circumstances and the type of speech at issue.”).    \nHere, Doe contends that his First Amendment right to anonymous speech requires \nquashing of the subpoenas.  Dkt. No. 19 at 5 –17.  Spider Labs responds  that First Amendment \nprotection does not bar its cla ims against Doe for defamatory and tortious  speech .  Dkt. No. 20 at \n8–10.  The parties also dispute whether the District of Arizona’s order quashing the subpoena to \nGoDaddy  (which also seeks documents revealing Doe’s true identity)  compels a similar order \nfrom this Court  under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.   \nThe Court first considers  whether and to what extent collateral estoppel applies  to this \ndispute . Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 8 of 18 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1. Application of collateral estoppel  \nOn October 23, 2020, the District of Arizona granted Doe’s motion to quash Spider Labs’s \nsubpoena to GoDaddy.  Spider Labs , 2020 WL 6262397 .  The Arizona court found that Spider \nLabs failed to make a prima facie showing on all elements of its defamation cl aim and that this \nfailure extended to all of other claims in the complaint .2  Id. at *2.  Spider Labs’s subsequent \nmotion to reconsider that ruling was denied.   \nCollateral estoppel , or issue preclusion, “bars  successive litigation of an issue of fact or \nlaw actually litigated and resolved in a valid court  determination,” where resolution of the issue \nwas “essential to the prior judgment.”   Taylor v. Sturgell , 553 U.S. 880, 892 (2008) .  Estoppel \napplies when the following four conditions are  met: “(1) the issue at stake was identical in both \nproceedings; (2) the issue was actually litigated and decided in the prior proceedings; (3) there was \na full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue; and (4) the issue was necessary to decide the \nmerits.”   Janjua v. Neufeld , 933 F.3d 1061, 1065 (9th Cir. 2019) (quoting  Oyeniran v. Holder , 672 \nF.3d 800, 806 (9th Cir. 2012), as amended  (May 3, 2012)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \nDoe asserts that all conditions necessary for collateral estoppel are met.  Dkt. No . 29 at 2 –3.  \nSpider Labs contends that (1) the issues at stake are not identical between the two proceedings , \nand (2) the issue of Doe’s standing to assert First Amendment protection was not actually litigated \nbefore  or decided by  the Arizona court.3  Dkt. No. 30 at 8 –10.   \nThe Court agrees , in part,  with Doe.  With respect to the question of whether Spider Labs \nsatisfie d its burden to come forward with competent evidence showing a prima facie case of \ndefamation, the Court finds that collateral estoppel applies .  First, t he principal issue presented to \n \n2 Spider Labs acknowledged at the hearing before this Court that all its other claims derived from \nits defamation claim.  Dkt. No. 28 at 38:20 –39:7.   \n \n3 Spider Labs further argues that the issue of falsity as to its defa mation claim was not fully \nlitigated before the Arizona court because that court did not have the same evidence before it: a \nsupplemental declaration from Spider Labs Chief Technology Officer Eurico Doraido, which \nSpider Labs submitted together with its su pplemental brief.  Dkt. No. 30 -2.  Doe objects to this \ndeclaration as violating Civil Local Rule 7 -3(d) and requests that the Court strike it.  Dkt. No. 31.  \nDoe’s objections are well -taken.  The Court will not consider the supplemental Doraido \ndeclaration .  In any event, “[t]he introduction of new evidence on a matter previously resolved is \nnot an exception to collateral estoppel.”   Oyeniran , 672 F.3d at 807.   \n Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 9 of 18 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  both this Court and the District of Arizona is whether Spider Labs made a prima facie showing on \nall elements of its defamation claim .  Second, t he parties actually litigated the question of Spider \nLabs’s prima facie showing before the District of Arizona , and in so doing relied on briefing and \nargument  that is largely id entical to the briefing and argument before this Court .4  See, e.g. , Spider \nLabs Ltd. v. Doe , No. MC -20-00039 -PHX -SPL, Dkt. No. 12 at 2 n.1  (D. Ariz. Oct. 13 , 2020)  \n(acknowledging that “[s]ubstantively identical motions to quash” were filed before the Dis trict of \nArizona and the Northern District of California and suggesting that the Arizona court should await \na ruling in the California court).  Third, although the District of Arizona did not hold a hearing on \nDoe’s motion to quash, the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the question in \nArizona .5  Fourth,  the District of Arizona  issued an order on the merits finding that Spider Labs \ndid not make a prima facie showing of defamation and quashing Spider Labs’ s subpoena  for that \nreason .   \nThe parties do not dispute that resolution of a miscellaneous discovery proceeding \nancillary to an underlying civil action may have collateral estoppel effect, even  where multiple \nsimilar  discovery disputes are litigated in parallel with one another and with the underlying action.  \nThe Court has been able to identify  only a few courts  that have considered this question, and those \nthat have generally agree that co llateral estoppel applies to ancillary discovery proceeding s such as \nthis one.  See, e.g. , Signature Mgmt. Team, LLC v. Doe , No. 13 –cv–14005 , 2015 WL 1245861 , at \n*4–7 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 18, 2015) ( noting that the Sixth Circuit has held that that “an order by  one \nfederal district court on a discovery dispute is res judicata on that same issue in another federal \ndistrict court that has concurrent jurisdiction of the discovery dispute”) (internal citation and \n \n4 Spider Labs argues that Doe’s motions to quash did not contain identical briefs or case law.  Dkt. \nNo. 30 at 5.  While the motions are not verbatim replicas of one another, upon examination, the \narguments and propositions for which various cases are cited are the same.  At the hearing, Spider \nLabs acknowledged that the evidence submitted to both c ourts was identical and the arguments \nsimilar.  Dkt. No. 28 at 42:13 –43:2.  \n \n5 Spider Labs asserts in its supplemental brief that “ on the issue of whether Spider Labs presented \ncompetent evidence of the falsity  of Doe’s statements, Spider Labs presented additional argument \nand clarification during the  hearing by this Court that was not considered by the Arizona court. ”  \nDkt. No. 30.  However, the District of Arizona has since  considered and rejected Spider Labs’s  \nmotion for reconsideration , demonstrating that Spider Labs has now ha d ample opportunity to \nlitigate the issue.  Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 10 of 18 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  quotation marks omitted); Kwolek v. United States , No. 11-mc-53, 2011 WL 2940984  (W.D. \nPenn . July 21, 2011) (finding Northern District of California’s denial of motion to quash IRS \nsummonses collaterally estopped plaintiff’s petition to quash before Eastern District of \nPennsylvania); Bounkhoun v. Barnes , No.  15-CV-631A, 2020 WL 1526917  (W.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, \n2020) (finding that special pre-suit discovery proceeding in state court  resulting in  denial of  \ndiscovery requests estopped plaintiff from later subpoenaing the same information ).  \nFurthermore, the Court finds that the District of Arizona’s decision was a sufficiently final \ndisposition on the merits for the purposes of collateral estoppel.  “ Only a  final judgment that is \n‘sufficiently firm ’ can be issue preclusive. ”  Robi v. Five Platters, Inc. , 838 F.2d 318, 326 (9th Cir. \n1988) .  Because Doe’s several motions to quash  are ancillary  proceedings , no final judgment will \nbe entered in those proceedings  pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58.  Nevertheless, “a n \norder denying a motion to quash  a subpoena qualifies as  a final decision on the merits for purposes \nof res judicata .”  Signature Mgmt. , 2015 WL 1245861 , at *4 (citing Westwood Chemical Co.  v. \nKulick, 656 F.2d 1224, 1227  (6th Cir.  1981) ); see also Highfields  Capital Mgmt. L.P. v. Doe , 385 \nF. Supp. 2d  969, 971 (N.D. Cal. 2005)  (“[R]esolution of the motion [to quash] will conclude the \nmiscellaneous proceeding in this distric t . . . . ”).  The Court observes that the Arizona court has \ndenied Spider Labs’s motion for reconsideration, but Spider Labs has not yet appealed the Arizona \ncourt’s order to the Ninth Circuit.  Thus, t he Arizona court’s order is sufficiently final for the \npurposes o f issue preclusion in that it signals the end of the discovery proceeding before that court.  \nHowever, the Court disagrees that collateral estoppel applies to all arguments Doe raises \nhere regarding application of the First Amendment.  The parties did not “ actually litigate,”  and the \nDistrict of Arizona  did not decide , whether  Doe is entitled to invoke First Amendment protection \nin the first instance .  “[A]n issue is actually litigated when an issue is raised, contested, and \nsubmitted for determination.”  Janjua, 933 F.3d at 1066; Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 27, \ncmt. (d) (1982) (“When an issue is properly raised, by the pleadings or otherwise, and is submitted \nfor determination and is determined, the issue is actually litigated . . . .”).   \nAccordingl y, the Court will consider whether the record supports Doe’s position that he is \nentitled to invoke  the protections of the First Amendment as a basis to quash Spider Labs’s Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 11 of 18 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  subpoenas.  \n2. Whether Doe is entitled to invoke First Amendment  protections  \nIn their original briefing, the parties assume  that Doe is a person who possesses rights \nunder the First Amendment.  Spider Labs disputes application of the First Amendment based on  \nthe nature of the challenged speech, not the status of the speaker.  Dkt. No. 20 at  8–10.  Doe \nsimply asserts that he has First Amendment rights.  Dkt. No. 19 at 5.   Because the basis for Doe’s \ninvocation of the First Amendment was not clear from the parties’ submissions, the Court \nrequested supplemental briefing identifying  the legal an d factual bases for application of the First \nAmendment.  Dkt. No. 25.  The Court did not authorize the submission of  supplemental  evidence.   \nU.S. citizens , whether inside or  outside U.S. territory , possess First Amendment rights.  \nAgency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc.  (“USAID I ”), 570 U.S. 205 (2013).  \nWhile under some circumstances non -citizens within a U.S. territory possess certain constitutional \nrights, “it is long settled as a matter of American constitutional law that foreign citizens outside \nU.S. territory do not possess rights under the U.S. Constitution.”  Agency for Int’l Dev. v. Alliance \nfor Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc.  (“USAID II ”), 140 S. Ct. 2082, 2086 (2020) (finding th at foreign \ncorporations do not possess First Amendment rights, even if affiliated with U.S. entities).  Thus, if \nDoe is a U.S. citizen or if he is a non -citizen within U.S. territory, then he may properly invoke the \nFirst Amendment ; otherwise, he may not.  \nIn the complaint before the Southern District of New York , Spider Labs alleges on \ninformation and belief that Doe is a U.S. citizen who resides within that district.  Spider Labs, Ltd. \nv. Doe , No. 1:20 -cv-05457 -LAP, Dkt. No. 1 ¶¶ 2 -4 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2020).  At the hearing, \nSpider Labs explained that  it has evidence  Doe was in New York when he sent the emails at issue , \nbut it does not know whether he is a U.S. citizen .  Dkt. No. 28 at 43:17 -18.  Doe’s declaration in \nsupport of his  motion to quash is entirely silent on these matters .  See Dkt. No. 19 -1; Dkt. No. 28 \nat 13:6 –15:12 .  In his supplemental brief, Doe asserts  that, irrespective of his U.S. citizenship \nstatus, he was indeed lawfully and physically present within the United States when he sent the \nemails at issue , as Spider Labs alleges .  Dkt. No. 29 at 8 –9.  He argues that his physical presence \nin the United States  entitles him to First Amendment protections.  Id. Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 12 of 18 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Court agrees with Doe that First Amendment speech pro tections “at a minimum apply \nto all persons legally within our borders.”  Underwager v. v. Channel 9  Australia , 69 F.3d 361, \n365 (9th Cir. 1995).   As Spider Labs does not dispute that Does was legally present within the \nU.S. at the time he sent the emails at issue, and did not oppose Doe’s motion to quash based on his \nstatus, the Court concludes that Doe  may invoke the First Amendment as a basis f or his motion to \nquash.  \n3. Alternatively, Spider Labs has not met its burden under a prima facie \nstandard  \nGiven the dearth of authority regarding application of the collateral estoppel doctrine in the \ncontext of parallel  ancillary discovery proceedings, the Court will additionally make clear its \nindependent views of the merits of this dispute.  \nAs Doe is a party to the underlying action in the Southern District of New York, the Court \nagrees with the District of Arizona that Spider Labs must satisfy a prima facie standard .   Here, the \nCourt relies on the standard as set forth  in Highfields Capital Mgmt., L.P. v. Doe , 385 F. Supp. 2d \n969 (N.D. Cal. 2005).  Rich v. Butowsky , No. 20 -mc-80081 -DMR, 2020 WL 5910069, at *3 n.2 \n(N.D. Cal. Oct. 6, 2020) (observing that the Highfields  test is appropriate where the anonymous \nspeaker is a party to the litigation); USA Techs ., 713 F. Supp. 2d at 907 (applying Highfields test \nwhere Doe defendant in underlying action moved to quash subpoena for information revealing his \nidentity).  Under Highfields , the Court requires: (1) the plaintiff to adduce, without the aid of \ndiscovery, competent evidence  addressing all of the inferences of fact essential to support a prima \nfacie case on all elements of a claim; and (2) if the plaintiff succeeds, the Court must then  \n \nassess and compare the magnitude of the harms that would be \ncaused to the competing intere sts by a ruling in favor of plaintiff and \nby a ruling in favor of defendant.  If, after such an assessment, the \ncourt concludes that enforcing the subpoena would cause relatively \nlittle harm to the defendant ’s First Amendment and privacy rights \nand that it s issuance is necessary to enable plaintiff to protect against \nor remedy serious wrongs, the court would deny the motion to \nquash.  \nHighfields, 385 F. Supp. 2d at 975 –76.  As Spider Labs acknowledged at the hearing, its claims of \ntortious interference with prospective economic advantage and tortious interference with a \ncontractual relationship derive from its defamation claim.  Dkt. No. 28 at 38:20 –39:7; see also Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 13 of 18 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Spider Labs , 2020 WL 6262397  at *3 (noting that all claims stem from the defamation claim).  \nThe Court therefore focuses on the defamation claim.  \nSpider Labs contends that the New York court  already determined that Spider Labs made \nthe requisite  prima facie showing when it concluded that “Spider Labs has adequately pleaded \nthree causes of action” inc luding defamation .  Spider Labs, Ltd. v. Doe , No. 1:20 -cv-05457 -LAP, \nDkt. No. 7  at 2 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 2020) ; Dkt. No. 20 at 3, 12.  However, the New York court’s \norder addressed only whether the allegations of the complaint pled claim s of defamation  and \ntortious interference  against Doe.  The court did not consider whether Spider Labs adduced \n“competent evidence” in support of those claims.   \nTo succeed on a claim for defamation,  a plaintiff must establish (1) a false statement about \nthe plaintiff; ( 2) that was published to a third party without authorization or privilege; ( 3) with \nfault amounting to at least negligence; and ( 4) that caused special harm or defamation per se.   Thai \nv. Cayre Group, Ltd. , 726 F.  Supp.  2d 323, 329 (S.D.N.Y. 20 10).  “[A] statement that ‘tend[s] to \ninjure the plaintiff in his or her trade, business or profession’ is defamatory per se and does not \nrequire proof of special damages to be actionable,” and “‘[w]here a statement impugns the basic \nintegrity or creditwor thiness of a business, an action for defamation lies and injury is conclusively \npresumed.’”  Id. at 331.    \nSpider Labs asserts that there are seven false statements in Doe’s emails:  \nStatement No. 1 : Doe was running an article about Spider Labs and its pro duct,  \nSpiderAF, on his blog;  \nStatement No. 2 : Spider Labs’s technology is not based on artificial intelligence;  \nStatement No. 3 : Spider Labs is defrauding its clients;  \nStatement No. 4 : Spider Labs’s clients are not protected from fraud;  \nStatement No. 5: Doe  had hired a team of engineers to test Spider Labs’s  \ntechnology;  \nStatement No. 6 : there is nothing behind Spider Labs’s platform; and  \nStatement No. 7 : Spider Labs’s platform cannot detect fraud.   \nDkt.

Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 14 of 18 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  The Court finds that Spider L abs has not provided competent  evidence supporting the first \nelement of its defamation  claim .  Statements Nos. 1 and 5 concern only Doe, not Spider Labs , and \ntherefore are not  actionable , even if false .  See Thai , 726 F. Supp. 3d at 329.   With respect to \nStatements Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7, to the extent these  statements are capable of being proved  true or \nfalse, Spider Labs has not adduced competent evidence to support a prima facie showing that they \nare false.   \nMr. Doraido’s  initial declar ation , on which Spider Labs relies,  does little  more than repeat \nthe allegations of the complaint in the underlying action.  Compare  Dkt. No. 20 -1 with Spider \nLabs, Ltd. v. Doe , No. 1:20 -cv-05457 -LAP, Dkt. No. 1 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2020).   Mr. Doraido  \ndoes not refute the challenged statements.  For example, he does not state that SpiderAF “uses AI -\ndrive n tools ,” whatever that mean s.  Instead, he simply states that “Spider Labs’s primary service, \nSpiderAF, is an anti -Ad Fraud software platform t hat offers users a variety of different services \nand functions, including a reporting dashboard, a shared ‘blacklist’ service, and a real -time Ad \nFraud detection application program interface that customers can implement to for handling fraud \naffecting the ir business.”  Dkt. No. 20 -1 ¶ 21.  It is not self -evident that those various services and \nfunctions have anything to do with AI.6  Nor does this assertion —or any other assertion by Mr. \nDoraido —show that SpiderAF  succeeds in detecting  Ad Fraud , thereby negating Doe’s statements \nthat Spider Labs is defrauding its clients and that its platform does not function to detect fraud.  In \nshort , Spider Labs has not offered competent evidence showing that  the challenged sta tements are \nactually false.   \nThe Court also finds that Spider Labs has not made a  prima facie showing  on the third \nelement of its defamation claim because it has not adduced competent evidence of fault  on Doe’s \npart.  Spider Labs argues that Doe’s failure  to contact Spider Labs before reaching out to its \ncustomers or to license its technology is evidence of negligence, but Spider Labs cites no  legal  \n \n6 Indeed, Statement No. 2 may not be capable of being proven true or false based on how one \ndefines “artificial intelligence.”  See Ayaadurai  v. Floor64, Inc. , 270 F. Supp. 3d 343 (D. Mass. \n2017) (holding that challenged statements could not be proved true or false because whether the \nplaintiff actually was the inventor of e -mail depended in substantial part on the definition of “e -\nmail,” which  the parties contested).

Dkt. No. 20 at 13 –14.  Spider Labs also criticizes Doe for not obtaining  \nspecific details about how Spider Labs’s service functioned in  each individual  customer’s situation  \nand for not fol lowing any “established methodology” for testi ng SpiderAF .  Spider Labs does  not \nexplain why it believes Doe had an obligation to obtain specific details  of Spider Labs’s service  or \nto use a particular  testing methodology (which  Spider Labs does not even describe).   Id.   \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Spider Labs has not adduced competent evidence \nsupporting  the first and third elements of its defamation claim , and likewise has not adduced \ncompetent evidence supporting his derivative claims for tortious interference .  Because the Court \nfinds that Spider Labs has not provided competent evidence of a prima facie case , the Court need \nnot consider the second part of the  Highfields  analysis.  \nD. Doe’s Request for Attorneys’ Fees and Costs  \nDoe seeks his attorneys’ fees and costs f or moving to quash the subpoenas under \nCalifornia Code of Civil Procedure § 1987.2(c) .  Dkt. No. 19 at 18 –19.  Section 1987.2(c)  \nprovides that, when a movant successfully quashes or modifies a subpoena served on an Internet \nservice provider (as defined in 42 U.S.C. §  230(f)(2)) for personally identifying information for \nuse in an action outside of California that arises from the movant’s exercise of free speech rights \non the Internet and the respondent fails to make a prima facie showing of a cause of actio n, the \nmovant is entitled to reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred in moving to quash or \nmodify.   \nAn award of fees  and costs  is not appropriate here.  First, “ a motion . . . filed under Section \n1987.1 for an order to quash or modify a subpoena from a court of this state for personally  \nidentifying information ” is a prerequisite for fees  and costs .  Cal. Civ.  Proc.  Code § 1987.2(c) .  \nDoe did not file a motion to quash pursuant to California Civil Code § 1987. 1; he moved solely \nunder Rule 45 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .  Dkt. No. 19 at 5.   Second, t he Court is not \npersuaded that Doe’s email communications with Spider Labs ’s customers are an “exercise of free \nspeech rights on the Internet.”  The challenged statements were not posted  publicly on the Internet , \nbut communicated instead by private email.   Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 16 of 18 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Furthermore, Doe cites no authority supporting application of § 1987.2(c ) in the \ncircumstances presented here.  He did not provide —nor could the Court find —any examples of \nCalifornia district courts applying section 1987.2 in a miscellaneous federal action where the \nunderlying action is premised on violations of another state’s laws.   The authority on which Doe \nrelies is distinguishable.  In Roe v. Halbig , 29 Cal.  App.  5th 286 (2018) , the California Court of \nAppeals held that a moving party  in a California state court action may  prevail within the me aning \nof section 198 7.2 even where a subpoena is withdrawn before the trial court rule s on the motion to  \nquash.  There, the challenged statements consisted of “‘ defamatory posts ’ about [the plaintiff]  on a \nnumber  of websites and social media sites ”: a clear case of speech “on the Internet” that is not \npresent here.  Id. at 293.  In In re Rule 45 Subpoena Issued to Cablevision Systems Corporation \nRegarding IP Address 69.120.35.31 , No. MISC 08 –347(ARR)(MDG) , 2010 WL 2219343  \n(E.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2010) , the federal district court did not consider  section 1987.2 at all, but \nawarded fees and costs solely under  Rule 45.   \nTo the extent Doe seeks an award of fees and costs under Rule 45(d)(1) —and it is not clear \nthat he does, see Dkt. No. 22 at 15 —the Court is no t persuaded that Spider Labs acted \nunreasonably or in bad faith in pursuing the subpoenas.   See Legal Voice v. Stormans Inc. , 738 \nF.3d 1178, 1185 (9th Cir. 2013) (noting that fees and costs under Rule 45(d)(1) is discretionary \nand that “[a] court may . . .  impose sanctions when a party issues a subpoena in bad faith, for an \nimproper purpose, or in a manner inconsistent with existing law”) (citing Mount Hope Church v. \nBash Back! , 705 F.3d 418, 425 (9th Cir. 2012) ; Mattel Inc. v. Walking Mountain Prods. , 353 F.3d \n792, 814 (9th Cir. 2003) ). \nThe Court denies Doe’s request for an awar d of attorneys’ fees and co sts. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court grants  Doe’s motion to quash the subpoenas to \nGoogle and LinkedIn .  Doe’s  request for relief und er California Code of Civil Procedure \n§ 1987.2(c)  is denied.  \n/// \n/// Case 5:20-mc-80141-VKD   Document 33   Filed 12/07/20   Page 17 of 18 \n18 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated: December 7, 2020  \n \n  \nVIRGINIA K.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against the developers of Michigan's Unemployment Insurance Agency's automated system, MiDAS, which allegedly falsely detected fraud in unemployment claims without adequate human oversight or proper notification to the claimants. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the plaintiffs sufficiently established standing, as their injuries from the fraud determinations were fairly traceable to the defendants' involvement with the automated system.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the plaintiffs have Article III standing to sue due to their alleged injuries being fairly traceable to the automated fraud detection system (MiDAS) developed and implemented with the assistance of the defendants, despite the claims not being fully processed or adjudicated by the system.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that the plaintiffs adequately demonstrated an injury-in-fact that was fairly traceable to the defendants' actions. The motion to dismiss on the grounds of subject matter jurisdiction was denied, allowing the procedural due process claim against the defendants to proceed.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation: Imagine a robot was built to catch people cheating on their homework, but it made a lot of mistakes. Some people got in trouble unfairly because the robot said they cheated without properly checking if they really did. The people who got in trouble sued the people who helped build the robot. The court said these people could continue with their lawsuit because they showed that their troubles were connected to the robot's mistakes, which the builders helped create.",

Honorable David M. Lawson  FAST ENTERPRISES LLC, CSG GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS, STEPHEN GESKEY,  SHEMIN BLUNDELL, DORIS MITCHELL, DEBRA SINGLETON, and SHARON  MOFFET-MASSEY,     Defendants. __________________________________________/   \nOPINION AND ORDER DENYING MOTIONS BY FAST  \nENTERPRISES LLC AND CSG GOVERNM ENT SOLUTIONS TO DISMISS \nFOR WANT OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION \n \n The five named plaintiffs have commenced this putative class acti on to recover damages \nallegedly caused by the State of Michigan’s Unemployment Insurance Agency’s (UIA) \nimplementation of an automated system to detect  and punish individuals who submitted fraudulent \nunemployment insurance claims.  They say that they  are victims of the system’s many failures: it \nlacked human oversight, it detected fraud by cert ain claimants where none existed, it provided \nlittle or no notice to the accused claimants, it failed in many inst ances to allow administrative \nappeals, and it assessed penalties and forfeitures ag ainst individuals who we re blameless.  Their \namended complaint listed twelve counts against th e companies and individuals whom they believe \ncontributed to the State’s implementation of th e flawed fraud-adjudication system.  The case has \nbeen whittled down through motion practice and an interlocutory app eal, and now only one Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 1 of 28-2- \n procedural due process claim re mains.  The defendants have f iled a second round of motions to \ndismiss, raising for the first time that the Court lacks subject matter  jurisdiction over the dispute.   \n  Defendants FAST Enterprises LLC and CS G Government Solutions argue that the \nplaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing because (1 ) they failed to dem onstrate an injury-in-\nfact because their claims were not  entirely adjudicated by the Michigan Integrated Data Automated \nSystem (MiDAS); (2) their alleged injuries are not fairly traceable to the corporate defendants; and \n(3) plaintiffs Patti Jo Cahoo, Kristen Mendyk, and Kh adija Cole are precluded from bringing their \nclaims because they failed to disclose their prop erty interests in this cause of action during their \nrespective bankruptcy proceedings.   The plaintiffs adequately have established standing.  Although the plaintiffs’ fraud cases \nmay not entirely have been auto-adjudicated by MiDAS, the UIA determined that each of the \nplaintiffs committed fra ud by applying the UIA’s logic trees, which mandated a finding of fraud \nwhenever a plaintiff fail ed to respond to a MiDAS-issued ques tionnaire.  Moreover, each plaintiff \nsufficiently demonstrated that th e UIA did not provide adequate notice of the plaintiffs’ fraud \ndeterminations and subsequent efforts to coll ect on their debts.  And because FAST and CSG \nworked hand-in-hand with the UIA in develo ping and managing the Mi DAS system (which \nincluded the deficient notice procedures), the plai ntiffs’ alleged injuries are fairly traceable to \nthem.  The record requires further factual de velopment on the accrual dates for the due process \nclaims of plaintiffs Cahoo, Cole and Mendyk vis- à-vis their bankruptcy filings, and there is \ninsufficient information to rule out ratification by a potential real  party in interest under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 17(a)(3).  The motions will be denied.     Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 2 of 28-3- \n I.  Background \n The facts of the case are well known to the pa rties and have been discussed in previous \nopinions issued by this Court and the court of appeals.  See Cahoo v. SAS Inst. Inc. , 322 F. Supp. \n3d 772, 785-89 (E.D. Mich. 2018), aff’d in part, rev’d in part and remanded sub nom.  Cahoo v. \nSAS Analytics Inc. , 912 F.3d 887 (6th Cir. 2019).  The dispute focuses on an automated fraud \ndetection computer application that the UIA implemented somet ime around 2013 known as \nMiDAS, which stands for the Mi chigan Integrated Data Automated System.  MiDAS was \ndeveloped to search for discrepancies in the records of unemployment compensation recipients, \nautomatically determine whet her the claimants committed fraud, and execute collection \nproceedings, which included intercepting tax refu nds and garnishing wages.  Auto-adjudication is \na process that starts with the automated generation of a flag, then leads to the automated generation of questionnaires, then to an automated dete rmination based on logic trees, followed by an \nautomated generation of a notice of fraud deter mination, then automated collection activity.   \n MiDAS, by no means a marvel of artificial  intelligence, operated on automated “logic \ntrees.”  It adjudicated fraud in  “stages,” which included “cre ated,” “opened,” “pending fact \nfinding,” “determination issued,” and “issue closed.”   If the word “batch” appeared next to any \nstage, it signified that MiDAS ha d changed the status automatical ly.  A human could perform any \nof these stages, except for the ge neration of the fraud questionnaire .  But human involvement could \nonly be established if a staff me mber edited the file, which coul d be seen in the system.   \n When MiDAS detected some discrepancy between employer-paid wages and employee-\nclaimed eligibility, it au tomatically issued  questionnaires to the clai mant.  Failure to respond \ntimely to a questionnaire (10 da ys for “green” claimants and 14 days for those corresponding via \npaper) resulted in a default determination that the claimant knowingly and intentionally Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 3 of 28-4- \n misrepresented or concealed inform ation to receive benefits unlaw fully.  When a claimant did \nrespond to the questionnaire, MiDAS’s programming,  based on its logic trees, found intentional \nfraud whenever a claimant chose certain multiple-c hoice options on the form, even if she indicated \nthat she did not intentionally  provide false information.  MiDAS had no programming that \npermitted it to determine whether a claimant intentionally misled the UIA or concealed \ninformation.    MiDAS made an automated fraud determination, usually at night, base d on the UIA’s logic \ntrees.  Staff members could also make the fraud determinations based on the same logic trees.  In either instance, the case would be staged from “pending adjudication” to  “determination issued” \nto “issue closed,” and the name of whoever made the decision would appear  beside the stages on \nthe “Nonmonetary Issue” screen.  MiDAS woul d then automatically issue a notice of \ndetermination.    Once a default fraud determination was made , MiDAS automatically issued three notices: \na primary “Notice of Determination” (Form 13 02), which explained why the UIA believed it \noverpaid (e.g., a claimant quitting a job voluntarily ) but not its reasoning for why it believed the \nplaintiff’s alleged misrepresentation was intentional; another “Notice of Determination” (also Form 1302), which generally informed the claimant that his or her actions misled or concealed information to obtain benefits a nd announced that benefits were terminated on any active claims; \nand a “List of Overpayments,” which demanded pa yment of actual benefits overpaid as well as a \nstatutory penalty for fraudulent mi srepresentation of two-to-four times that amount, depending on \nwhether the value of improper pa yments equaled or exceeded $500.  Confusingly, the first two \nnotices have the same title and same fo rm numbers, but different contents.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 4 of 28-5- \n  The primary determination notices indicated that claimants were entitled to appeal a \ndetermination of fraud to an Admin istrative Law Judge (ALJ) within 30 days.  But the notices did \nnot inform claimants about their ab ilities to file late appeals for good cause.  And because of errors \nin notifying claimants, many cla imants did not become aware of their assessments until after the \nappeal deadlines passed.   If a claimant did not appeal the determinati on within 30 days, MiDAS automatically issued \na letter (Form 1088) demanding that  the claimant pay restitution, a penalty, and accrued interest.  \nIf a claimant failed to pay the charges voluntarily, MiDAS issued ta x refund intercepts to the IRS \nand State of Michigan.  And if intercepting a claimant’s tax re turns did not satisfy the claimant’s \ndebt, the UIA then garnished his or her wages.    In August 2015, the UIA deactivated MiDAS’s auto-adjudication processes relating to \nclaimant fraud.  In a lawsuit br ought against UIA personnel, this Court found flaws in the State’s \nrobo-fraud-detection system and eventually appr oved a settlement agreement in which the State \nagreed, among other things, to suspend all coll ection activity under the au tomated system and to \nreview determinations of claimant fraud that had been reached while it was using the auto-adjudication function.  See Zynda v. Arwood , 175 F. Supp. 3d 791 (E.D. Mich. 2016).  Later, \nMichigan enacted new legislation that prohibits  fraud determinations ba sed solely on computer-\nidentified discrepancies.    The plaintiffs allege that th e defendants worked together with  the state to design, maintain, \noperate, and implement the robo-fra ud-detection and adjudication system.  As a consequence of \nthe inherent flaws built into the system, the plain tiffs contend, the defendants, operating as state \nactors, have taken property from them through the automated system that labeled them fraudsters, Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 5 of 28-6- \n and then assessed and collected fines and penaltie s, all without notice a nd an opportunity to be \nheard.  \nA. FAST \n FAST Enterprises, LLC, a software company, contracted with the St ate of Michigan on \nAugust 29, 2011, to “design, configure and implem ent its GenTAX comme rcial-off-the-shelf” \nsoftware for the UIA’s use in administering  unemployment insurance, including fraud \ninvestigation, overpayments, coll ections, and tax intercepts.  FAST’s involvement with MiDAS \nwas substantial.  It contracted to configur e “almost all aspects of ” MiDAS and train UIA \nemployees on how to use the system.  It also agreed to develop the templates of all MiDAS \ncorrespondence, including questionnaires and de termination notices, a nd ensured that the \ntemplates complied with “Federal an d State law delivery requirements.”  \n The UIA provided FAST with business rules, or logic trees, to implement in the system. \nThe logic trees broke down the various ways on e may be determined to have misrepresented \nmaterial information, such as by  failing timely to answer a qu estionnaire.  Although FAST coded \nthe software, UIA witness Clayton Tierney made clea r that the functi ons of the software (i.e., the \nlogic trees) were controlled exclusively by th e UIA.  Moreover, although FAST’s contract \nobligated it to develop the temp lates for MiDAS correspondence, UI A witnesses test ified that “no \nCSG, FAST, or SAS employees were involved in determining the content or crafting the language \nof those notices or questionna ires sent to claimants.”   \nB. CSG \n The State first retained CSG, a consulting co mpany from Chicago, to he lp devise a request \nfor proposal for the development of MiDAS.  Around February 2010, CSG contracted with the \nState to run and administer th e project control office, which was responsible for overseeing the Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 6 of 28-7- \n implementation of MiDAS.  CSG’s responsibilities grew and it eventu ally played two roles for the \nUIA — one as an advisor, the other as a project manager. \n1.  Advisory Role \n CSG assisted the State with improving its fraud detection and ove rpayment collection \nactivities by analyzing the UIA’s cu rrent practices, researching othe r state practices, and devising \nshort- and long-term solutions to  meet the UIA’s goals.   CSG played an advisory role; the UIA \nhad exclusive authority to set su ch policies and procedures and ne ver delegated that authority to \nCSG.  CSG was not responsible fo r determining the algorithms or logic trees that the UIA intended \nfor the MiDAS software.    In its advisory role, CSG developed the UIA’s income-spr eading policy — it  recommended \nthat the UIA “prorate earnings” to “establish a ny resulting overpayment” “[w]hen there is no \nemployer response and [a] claimant  does not provide credible earn ings informatio n.”  It also \nrecommended that the UIA “[r]everse the current Ag ency culture where staff is reluctant to render \na fraud determination because it is viewed as to o punitive on the claimant.”  For example, CSG \nsuggested that the UIA u pdate its fraud questionnai re (Form 1070) to  reduce the available answers \nthat resulted in findings of non- fraudulent activity (like asking  claimants whether overpayments \nresulted from a mistake).  However, CSG also recommended that the UI A clarify the wording on \nits questionnaire by (1) changing the title to make  clear that the inquiry related to fraud; (2) \nexplaining in bold text that the claimant’s employer provided suff icient information warranting a \nfinding of overpayment; and (3) including the potential amount of  overpayment, penalties, and \ndisqualifications based on th e information available.   \n  The UIA eventually developed a new fraud questionnaire (Form 1713), but contrary to \nCSG’s recommendations, it did not include any new, clarifying language, nor did it provide factual Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 7 of 28-8- \n information about the fraud allega tions, as the previous questionnair es did.  Rather, the new form \nincluded potentially incriminatory multiple-choice an swers designed to elicit binary answers that \nreadily could be processed by MiDAS for automa ted fraud determinations.  And unlike the old \nquestionnaire, and in contrast to CSG’s reco mmendations, the new Form 1713 did not inform \nclaimants that failing to respond would result in a fraud determina tion.  CSG Fraud Audit \nRecommendations, ECF No. 434-1, PageID.25327 (“Th e form could be redesigned so that the \nclaimant is not under the impression that comp letion of the form is voluntary”).    \n CSG did not recommend that the UIA rely  on purely an automated decision-making \nsystem; rather, it suggested that MiDAS develop recommended decisions subject to review by an \nexaminer.  “If the examiner elects to render a deci sion that is contrary to  the decision recommended \nby the system, the issue will be pended and routed to a manager for approval.”  CSG Fraud Audit Recommendations, ECF No. 434-1, PageID.25327.   \n2. Project Management \n After the UIA chose FAST to develop MiDAS , the UIA relied on CSG for on-site project \nmanagement services through the Project Control Office that CSG established.  According to the \ncontract, CSG’s Project Control Office was required to “support the State — and the State’s \napplication development and impl ementation vendor — in meeting the timely deliver y of quality \ninformation technology services for all stakeholders of the UI Syst em Modernization Project.”  It \nwas also understood that the System Integration Project team would be “comprised of both CSG’s \nProject Management Office and the State of Michigan [Depar tment of Technology] and UIA \nStaff.”  The contract made CSG “responsible for utilizing and mentoring these State staff” and \nmaintaining “continuous liaison with . . . the St ate Senior Project Managers [and] Executive \nSponsor.”    Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 8 of 28-9- \n  As project manager, CSG wa s responsible for “performing schedule, scope and technical \ncontrol tasks over all aspects of  the project.”  CSG agreed to  provide “independent oversight, \nmonitoring, and reporting on activities and metric s critical for on-time delivery of quality \ntechnology services that meet th e needs of the UIA and DIT.”  CSG also was responsible for \n“creating and maintaining de tailed . . . [p]roject plans and sc hedules that support project scope, \ncosts, milestones, and deliverables” during th e project development.  UIA manager Clayton \nTierney explained that CSG primar ily helped ensure that the proj ect remained on schedule and on \nbudget, and that MiDAS implemented th e UIA’s requested functionality.   \n John Walsworth, the CEO of CSG, explaine d that although CSG led many administrative \naspects of MiDAS, it ultimately had no decision- making power to set agency policy, establish \nparticular algorithms or logic trees in the software , or operate the software at any time.  He also \nmaintains that “CSG did not have  any role in determining the compliance of State [unemployment \ninsurance] policies or the MiDAS system with stat e or federal law;” “those  decisions were made \nby the State.”   \nC.  The Plaintiffs \n1. Patti Jo Cahoo \n  Patti Jo Cahoo collected une mployment benefits from January  12 through June 29, 2013.  \nShe chose to forego written notices on her bene fit account (“going green”) and directed the UIA \nto provide her with email alerts.  She understood th at it was her obligation to check her email and \nthe UIA’s website, MiWAM, for correspondence from the UIA.    Shortly after Cahoo went “green,” her form er employer, Randstad Employment Solutions, \nprotested her eligibility, allegi ng that she voluntarily quit.  On May 2, 2014, a UIA examiner, \n“robinson12,” reviewed Cahoo’s file  and opened a fraud case.  That  caused the MiDAS system to \npost a fraud questionnaire on Ca hoo’s MiWAM account and send he r an email no tifying her to Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 9 of 28-10- \n check her account.  Cahoo alleges that she “was unaware of th e posting and did not respond.”  \n More than one year later, the UIA usi ng MiDAS determined th at Cahoo committed fraud \nbased on her failure to respond, and MmiDAS gene rated two notices of de termination, both dated \nMay 27, 2015.  Her Primary Notice of Determinati on explained that she “quit [her] job with \nRandstad Employment Solutions on January 11, 2013 due to other pers onal reasons,” and that her \n“leaving was voluntary and not a ttributable to the employer. ”  Her Secondary Notice of \nDetermination accused her of “i ntentionally misle[ading] and/or  conceal[ing] information to \nobtain benefits [she] was not enti tled to receive.”  Attached to the secondary notice was a list of \noverpayments charging Cahoo $34,475.00 total:  $7,095.00 in principal and $28,380.00 as a \npenalty.    Cahoo contends that she was also unaware of the fraud de termination and did not hear \nabout the determination until she filed for bankrupt cy “months later.”  But her deposition testimony \ncontradicts that position, as she indicates that she may have had at least some notice.  She \ncalculated in her head that she might have  owed $12,000 including the 100% penalty, which she \nmentioned to her attorney, who suggested that she may have to  seek Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nprotection.  That prompted her to check her credit report, wher e she discovered the true amount \nowed.  She conceded that the fraud questionnaire  and notices of determination were posted on her \nMiWAM account.  She also admitted to deleting periodically UIA notificati ons sent to her email \naddress and neglecting to read  UIA letters posted on her MiWA M account because she was not \nseeking benefits after 2013.    On September 22, 2016, Cahoo filed for Chapte r 7 bankruptcy; she received a discharge \non January 15, 2017.  In her bankruptcy petition, she di d not list her claim in this case but included \nher UIA debts in her schedule of liabilities.  On January 4, 2017, the UIA filed an adversary Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 10 of 28-11- \n complaint, opposing the discharge of the UIA debt based on Cahoo’s alleged fr aud.  But around \nFebruary 3, 2017, Cahoo received a redeterminat ion of her fraud case following the court \napproved-settlement with the State in Zynda v. Arwood .   \n The UIA’s designated 30(b)(6) witness, Kevi n Smith, reviewed Cahoo’s file and opined \nthat UIA examiners were involved in Cahoo’s fraud determination and that a UIA claims examiner \ntook the actions that led to the determination.  However, he “di dn’t see [the] stag ing screen” for \nCahoo’s intentional misrep resentation case.    \n2. Kristen Mendyk \n Kristen Mendyk received unemployment benefits from July 2, 2011 to March 31, 2012.  She chose to receive correspondenc e from the UIA by mail.  Based on  an employer protest, the \nUIA investigated her for fraud in 2012 and ag ain in 2013.  The UIA sent her two fraud \nquestionnaires, one on July 20, 2012 (pre-MiDAS) and the other on November 4, 2013.  The UIA \nsent the questionnaires to the address Mendyk provided in Saint Charles, Michigan.  But she \nalleges that she never received the questionnaires because she no longer lived at the address when \nthey were sent.     Mendyk never responded to the UIA’s fraud questionnaires.  In November 2013 and \nJanuary 2014, the UIA adjudicated three claims of  fraud against her, all opened by “wisemans 1” \nand adjudicated by “batch.”  The fraud determinati ons also went to the Saint Charles, Michigan \naddress on November 4 and 12, 2013, and January  15, 2014.  Mendyk no longer lived there at the \ntime.    On February 25, 2014, the UIA sent a mont hly delinquency statem ent charging Mendyk \n$32,748, consisting of $9,355.00 in overpayment, $22,702.00 in penalty charges, and $691.15 in interest.  MiDAS then seized Mendyk’s tax re turns and garnished her wages between May 2014 Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 11 of 28-12- \n and July 2016, collectin g a total of $5,983.71 from her.  Mendyk alleges that she did not learn \nabout the fraud determinations unt il she attempted to file a nother claim in 2017.  But she \nacknowledged that she was obligated  to keep her address current wi th the UIA and conceded that \nshe committed the misrepresentation alleged.  Bu t she maintained that she did not intend to \nmisrepresent her wages, and that she mista kenly reported an incorrect amount.    \n The UIA eventually reconsidered Mendyk’s dete rmination in response to a Department of \nLabor’s review of MiDAS auto-adjudications.  On October 12, 2016, a UI A employee mailed her \na redetermination notice, but it was returned as undeliverable.  Between December 30, 2014, and \nOctober 12, 2016, several letters that the UIA sent  to Mendyk were returned and marked “return \nto sender,” or “not deliverable as addressed,” including a 2014 le tter attempting to collect $30,080 \nand the 2016 redeterm ination notice.   \n Mendyk filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on De cember 16, 2016, to which the UIA filed a \ncomplaint in opposition.  Although she included her UIA debts on her schedule of liabilities, she \ndid not list the cause of action she asserts in th is case.  She was represented by counsel in her \nbankruptcy case and discussed this  action with him.  On Febr uary 28, 2017, Mendyk informed her \nChapter 13 trustee of her potential due process claim, which the trus tee authorized her to pursue.  \nHowever, she entered into a consent judgment with the UIA on April 12, 2017, in which she admitted to the alleged fraud and agreed to pay $6,793.70.    The UIA’s designated 30(b)(6) witness, Ka therine Potter, review ed Mendyk’s file and \nopined that a UIA examiner made Mendyk’s fraud de terminations.  Curiously, she did not address \nthe fact that “batch” appears next to each stage change from “pending adjudication” to \n“redetermination issued” and from “redeterminati on issued” to “issue clos ed,” which occurred Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 12 of 28-13- \n within the span of several sec onds, and which were well beyond ordinary business hours (between \n8:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m.).   \n3. Khadija Cole \n Khadija Cole received unemployment bene fits from March 1 th rough June 28, 2014 and \nopted for email corresponden ce with the UIA.  The UIA apparent ly suspected that she failed to \ndisclose vacation pay for the week of March 1, 2014, despite that she repeatedly certified that she \nwas not receiving such pay.  The UIA sent he r a fraud questionnaire on October 3, 2014.  The UIA \nalso detected earning discrepancies for the week s of April 5 to June 28, 2014, and on February 12, \n2015, MiDAS issued another questionnaire inquiring about unreported wages.   The UIA sent the \nquestionnaires to her MiWAM account, and sh e received an emai l to check it.   \n Cole never responded to the questionnair es, and on October 16, 2014 and February 26, \n2015, MiDAS determined that Cole commit ted fraud.  MiDAS issued corresponding \nredetermination notices to her MiWAM account.  \n Both of Cole’s fraud cases were opened by UIA employees, but “batch” (MiDAS) updated \nthe stages of the cases from “pending adjudication,” to “issue closed” within seconds for each case.  \nThe first case concerned vacation pay during one week in March 2014;  Cole alleges that the second \ncase was flagged improperly based on MiDAS’s “i ncome spreading” programming.  As evidence, \nshe points to the UIA’s “Notice of Redetermin ation” issued on Febr uary 27, 2015, which found \nthat she received exactly $733.45 in wages every week between April 5 and June 28, 2014.  MiDAS also issued a list of overpayments, st ating that it overpaid exactly $362.00 each week \nbetween April 5 and June 28, 2014, and charging  her $24,530, consisting of $4,706 in principal \nand $18,824.00 in penalty fees.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 13 of 28-14- \n  Cole insists that she never received any ema il, a fraud questionnaire, a fraud determination, \nor any notice of the fraud charges against her whatso ever.  She testif ied that she first learned about \nthe fraud determination when she received a statement of debt by mail from UIA around the \nsummer of 2016.  The UIA ultimately assessed $4 ,950 in principal and $19,346 in penalties.   \n On October 3, 2016, Cole filed for Chapter 13  bankruptcy.  In her petition, she included \nher UIA debts on her schedule of lia bilities but did not list  her cause of action in this case as an \nasset.  She was represented by counsel during her bankruptcy proceedings and discussed this \nlawsuit with him.  While her bankruptcy was pending, Cole admitted to committing fraud and \nentered into a consent judgmen t with the UIA on March 29, 2017.  Her bankruptcy proceedings \nappear to be ongoing.    Kevin Smith, the UIA’s designated 30(b)(6) witness who testified about both Cahoo’s and \nCole’s files, did not opine about the extent  of auto-adjudicatio n in Cole’s case.  \n4. Michelle Davison \n \n Michelle Davison received unemployment be nefits from May 25 through November 23, \n2013, and from March 22 through Ju ly 19, 2014.   She applied for her second round of employment \nbenefits on March 17, 2014, alleging that she was laid  off from her job.  She opted for regular mail \ncorrespondence and directed the UIA to contact her at an address on Leer da Street in Flint, \nMichigan.  She certifie d that she understood that she was responsible for reading the UIA \nHandbook, which set forth her oblig ation to update the UIA about  any address changes.  \n  Davison’s former employer proteste d her unemployment cl aim around March 2014, \ncontending that she voluntarily quit.  A UIA employee opened an  investigation on October 7, 2014, \nand the UIA sent a fraud questionnaire to Davi son’s designated address the following day.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 14 of 28-15- \n  Davison testified that she no longer was living at that addr ess, had never received the \nquestionnaire, and was unable to respond.  But he r recollection was quite foggy.  (“I was probably \nmoved by then, ‘cuz I – I don’t re member.  I don’t even  remember exactly when I moved out of \nthere. I think was probably gone by then.”).  On October 22, 2014, the UIA mailed a notice of \ndetermination to the Flint address stating that sh e was ineligible for benefits.  But the notice was \nreturned as undeliverable on November 11, 2014.    On December 29, 2014, Davison called the UIA to unlock her MiWAM account, and during that call she updated her address to reflec t that she lived on Saginaw Street in Flint, \nMichigan.  But the UIA never resent  the fraud questionnaire, nor did it  do anything to verify that \nDavison received it.    On January 15, 2015, the UIA issued another fraud determination to Davison’s updated \naddress and assessed $6,222 in principal and $740 in  penalties.  Davison alleges that she never \nreceived any correspondence and first learned about the fraud de termination from the IRS when \nthe UIA intercepted her 2015 federa l tax refund, although she does not st ate when that happened.   \nShe filed a late appeal of her fraud determination, after her Zynda  review, and prevailed on May \n8, 2017.    The UIA’s designated 30(b)(6) witness, Jessic a Hart, reviewed Davis on’s file and opined \nthat a UIA examiner made Davison’s fraud deter minations.  The term “bat ch” appears beside only \none entry in the relevant time period, which cha nged the stage of Davison’s case from “pending \nfact finding to pending adjudica tion.”  The names of UIA employe es appear beside every other \nentry.  \n \n   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 15 of 28-16- \n 5. Hyon Pak \n  Hyon Pak received unemployment benefits  from September 24, 2011 through March 3, \n2012.  In September 2012, before implementing MiDAS, the UI A opened a fraud investigation \nand sent Pak three pre-MiDAS que stionnaires by mail on September 24.  The first two concerned \nemployer Express Services, a nd the third addressed Employ er Eagle Industries.   \n He responded to all three on September 26, 2012.  On October 8, 2012, Pak received two more pre-MiDAS fraud questionnaires, one regardi ng Express Services, the other regarding Eagle \nIndustries.  Believing they were duplicat es, he did not respond to them.   \n About a year later (and after MiDAS rolled out ), Pak chose to “go green” and provided the \nUIA with his email address.  His “Go Green” agr eement stated that it was his responsibility to \nmonitor his MiWAM account fo r any UIA correspondence.   \n  About one year after Pak went “green,”  on December 29, 2014, the UIA posted four fraud \ndeterminations on Pak’s MiWAM account, all of which involved MiDAS.  The system had gone \nback over two years to review Pak’s September 26, 2012 responses to the UIA’s questionnaires.  \nHowever, a staff member had to enter his respons es into MiDAS and open the fraud issues because \nthe old questionnaires prompted handwritten re sponses.  About four hours after the employee \nopened Pak’s cases, “batch” changed the stages from  “pending adjudication” to “issue closed.”  \nThe UIA issued determination notices that day, December 29, 2014.    Pak contends that he was unaware of the fraud determinations until 2016, when the UIA intercepted his federal tax ref und.  But during his deposition, he conceded that the UIA sent \nelectronic notices as he requeste d.  He maintained that he coul d not recall whether he saw the \nnotices on his MiWAM account but conceded th at someone (possibly his wife) accessed his Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 16 of 28-17- \n MiWAM account on December 29, 2014, and January 2, 2015 — the same day the UIA emailed \nhim to check his account.    He filed an untimely appeal in 2017, but the UIA eventually reversed Pak’s fraud determinations after it permi tted him to appeal again.   \n Defendants FAST and CSG contend in their moti ons to dismiss that these plaintiffs have \nnot established standing to sue them, as require d by Article III of the Constitution, and therefore \nthis Court has no jurisdiction over the case.   \nII.  Discussion \n A defendant may move under Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 12(b) (1) to dismiss a case \n“for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.”  Cartwright v. Garner , 751 F.3d 752, 759 (6th Cir. 2014). \nThe issue of subject matter jurisdiction lurks in every federal case because the Constitution \nauthorizes federal courts to decide only “Cases” and “Controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1; Warth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975). \nThe motion under Rule 12(b)(1) may be brought as a facial attack  — that is, a challenge to \nthe sufficiency of the complaint — or a factual attac k, as here — taking in evidence beyond the \npleadings. Cartwright , 751 F.3d at 759.  For the latter, courts have “wide discretion” to consider \naffidavits and documents “to arrive at the factua l predicate that subject-matter jurisdiction does or \ndoes not exist.”  Gentek Bldg. Prods., Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co ., 491 F.3d 320, 330 (6th Cir. \n2007). The Court also may take judici al notice of its own records.  See Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2 ); \nUnited States v. Doss , 563 F.2d 265, 269 n. 2 (6th Cir. 1977). The plaintiffs have the burden to \nprove the jurisdictional facts, Cartwright , 751 F.3d at 760, and all par ties have had the opportunity \nto present evidence on that issue. The Court “has the power to weigh [that] evidence and determine \nthe effect of that evidence on the co urt’s authority to hear the case.”  Id. at 759-60.  Although this Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 17 of 28-24- \n injuries are fairly traceable to CSG because it “co ntributed to the formatio n of the policies and the \nimplementation of the system” that po tentially violated their rights.  Ibid. \n Merely providing advice to a third party that voluntarily injures another is constitutionally insufficient to expose one to liab ility, whereas actively pa rticipating in the inju ry is sufficient.  \nCrawford , 868 F.3d at 457.  Under that rationale, CSG’s ro le as an advisor to the UIA, even though \nit urged the UIA to “[r]everse the current Agency cu lture where staff is reluctant to render a fraud \ndetermination because it is view ed as too punitive on the claimant ,” CSG Fraud Audit Report, ECF \nNo. 434-1, PageID.25320, may not be sufficient to expose it to liability.  In that regard, the UIA’s decision to accept the advice is refe rable to its “voluntary choice.”  Ibid.   \n But CSG did not just provide advice.  It migrated beyond advising when it acted as the onsite project manager for MiDAS.  CSG primarily served an administrative role, ensuring that the project stayed on budget and on time.  But it also “mento red” UIA staff and maintained \n“continuous liaison with  . . . the State Senior Project Mana gers.”  CSG Contract, ECF No. 425-4, \nPageID.19664.  And it supported FAST “in meeting th e timely delivery of  quality information \ntechnology services” for MiDAS’s stakeholders.  Ibid.  Some of its tasks also included conducting \ncost-benefit analyses, developing and mana ging project schedules,  facilitating team \ncommunications, and monitoring performance.     These actions amounted to active manageme nt and supervision by CSG.  And although \nCSG did not run MiDAS, it monitored the syst em’s performance and conducted cost-benefit \nanalyses. Doing so should have alerted it to the potentially unconstitutional adjudications and collection practices, and it certai nly learned about them in June  2015, when the Auditor General \npublished its report.  That may fall short of estab lishing proximate cause, but it satisfies the “fairly Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 24 of 28-25- \n traceable’ requireme nt for standing.  Allen, 468 U.S. at 751; Parsons , 801 F.3d at 71 4 (describing \n“fairly traceable” inquiry as “more than speculative but le ss than but-for” causation).   \nC.  Bankruptcy Filings \n FAST and CSG contend that plaintiffs Cahoo, Mendyk, and Cole do not own their causes \nof action because they f iled for bankruptcy before they co mmenced this case and their claims \nbelong to their respective bankruptcy estates.  They lack st anding to sue, say the defendants, \nbecause they are not the r eal parties in interest a nd they are judicially estopped from pursuing their \nclaims.    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(a) provides  that an action “must be prosecuted in the \nname of the real party in interest.”  Fed. R. Ci v. P. 17(a).  However, “[t]he court may not dismiss \nan action for failure to prosecute in the name of the real party in interest until, after an objection, \na reasonable time has been allowed for the real part y in interest to ratify, join, or be substituted \ninto the action.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a)(3). \n When an individual files for ba nkruptcy, a bankruptcy  estate is created, which consists of \n“all legal or equitable interests of  the debtor in property as of th e commencement of the case.” 11 \nU.S.C. § 541(a)(1).  The bankruptc y estate includes all causes of action that accr ued before the \nbankruptcy petition was file d, even if the debtor did not disclose it.  Auday v. Wet Seal Retail, Inc ., \n698 F.3d 902, 904 (6th Cir. 2012).  Thus, once a debtor  files a bankruptcy petition, the debtor “‘has \nno standing to pursue’ [a pre-petit ion cause of action] alone.”  Ibid. (quoting Bauer v. Commerce \nUnion Bank , 859 F.2d 438, 440-41 (6th Cir. 1988)).   \n To determine whether a cause of action is pre- petition, which belongs to the estate, or post-\npetition, which belongs to the debtor, the Sixt h Circuit applies the approach described in Segal v. \nRochelle , 382 U.S. 375, 380 (1966).  Under Segal , pre-petition assets are those that are Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 25 of 28-26- \n “‘sufficiently rooted in the pre- bankruptcy past’ of the debtor.”  Tyler v. DH Cap. Mgmt., Inc ., 736 \nF.3d 455, 461 (6th Cir. 2013) (quoting Segal , 382 U.S. at 380).  “Pre-p etition conduct or facts \nalone will not ‘root’ a claim in the past; there must be a pre-petition violation.”  Id. at 462.  The \nSixth Circuit made clear that “accrual for the purpo ses of § 541 is different from accrual for statute-\nof-limitations purposes” and that “the relevant bankruptcy-law question is when the claim is \nminimally actionable, not whether the claim is fully mature.”  Id. at 463, 464.  Thus, “all causes \nof action that hypothetically could have been brought  pre-petition are property of the estate.”   Ibid. \n(quoting Bd. of Trustees of Teamsters Loca l 863 Pension Fund v. Foodtown, Inc. , 296 F.3d 164, \n169 n. 5 (3d Cir. 2002)).    The issue ultimately boils down to when the causes of action for each plaintiff accrued \nrelative to when they filed for bankruptcy.  The plai ntiffs maintain that th eir claims did not accrue \nuntil they spoke to their civil rights lawyers in February 2017 — after they commenced their \nbankruptcy proceedings — and supposedly learned for the first time that they may have been \ndeprived of due process.   \n A section 1983 claim accrues “‘ when the plaintiff know s or has reason to know that the act \nproviding the basis of his or her injury has occurred.’”  D’Amborsio v. Marino , 747 F.3d 378, 384 \n(6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Cooey v. Strickland , 479 F.3d 412, 416 (6th Cir. 2007)).  “Courts \ndetermine the accrual date of a claim by asking ‘w hat event should have alerted the typical lay \nperson to protect his or her rights.’” Am. Premier Underwriters, Inc. v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. , \n839 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Roberson v. Tennessee , 399 F.3d 792, 794 (6th Cir. \n2005).  “In procedural-due-process cla ims . . . , a plaintiff’s  injury accrues at th e time that process \nwas denied because ‘the allegedly infirm  process is an injury in itself.’”  Ibid. (quoting  Nasierowski \nBros. Inv. Co. v. City of Sterling Heights , 949 F.2d 890, 894 (6th Cir. 1991) (finding that the Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 26 of 28-27- \n plaintiff’s injuries accrued when a local zoning council conven ed a critical session that departed \nfrom the required notice and co mment procedures, even though the council had not yet reached a \nfinal decision on the plaintiff’s deve lopment plans for his property)).  \n The factual record in this case is not de veloped sufficiently to determine when the \nplaintiffs’ claims accrued.  There may be circumstan ces with the individual plaintiffs that call into \nquestion whether they are the real party in interest  — or if not, whether they have or could become \nso by ratification of their claims  by their respective bankruptcy tr ustees — and whether they are \njudicially estopped from pressing their claims.  But those are merits questions that do not \nundermine subject matter  jurisdiction, which is the subject of th e present motion.  See Primax \nRecoveries, Inc. v. Gunter,  433 F.3d 515, 518–19 (6th Cir. 2006) (“ ‘Clarity would be facilitated \n. . . if courts and litigants used the label ‘jurisdi ctional’ not for claim-proc essing rules, but only for \nprescriptions delineating the cla sses of cases (subject-matter jurisd iction) and the persons (personal \njurisdiction) falling with in a court’s adjudicatory  authority.’”) (quoting Eberhart v. United States,  \n546 U.S. 12, 16 (2005) (per curiam), and citing Kontrick v. Ryan,  540 U.S. 443, 453 (2004)).  \nIII.  Conclusion \n The plaintiffs sufficiently have demonstrated  an injury-in-fact (fraud determinations based \non the rigid application of the UI A’s rigid logic trees coupled with inadequa te notice procedures) \nthat is fairly traceable to FAST’s and CSG’s conduct.  Although the defendants make colorable \narguments that Cahoo and Cole are not the real part ies in interest of, or are judicially estopped \nfrom bringing, their claims, the fact ual record is not complete to establish conclusively that their \nclaims are pre-petition or no longer belong to them.   \n Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 495, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 12/21/20   Page 27 of 28-28- \n  Accordingly, it is ORDERED  that the motions by defendant s CSG and FAST to dismiss \nfor want of subject matter ju risdiction (ECF No. 297, 313) are DENIED .   \n        s / D a v i d  M .

    "summary": "1. Summary: In this habeas corpus case, Joseph Lee Jones, a pretrial detainee in Douglas County Jail, Kansas, claims his rights were violated due to delays in competency evaluations and trial proceedings. The court dismissed the petition due to failure to exhaust state remedies and because Jones only raised issues tied to state law, which federal habeas corpus does not cover. He also claimed that artificial intelligence (AI) intervention impacted his cases, but the court found these assertions meritless.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the petitioner exhausted state court remedies and whether his claims raise valid federal constitutional issues warranting habeas corpus relief.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court denied the habeas corpus petition, finding that the petitioner failed to exhaust state remedies and did not present a valid federal constitutional claim under the Sixth, Eighth, or Fourteenth Amendments. The court also dismissed claims related to AI intervention as lacking merit.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Suppose a man named Joseph is stuck in jail and thinks his rights are being violated because his trial is delayed and he had a bad experience in jail. He asked the court to let him go and said a robot might be influencing decisions against him. The court told him he needed to try all his options in local courts first, and only federal issues are allowed in this kind of case. So, the court decided they can't help him and denied his request.",
    "full_text": "1 \n  \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS  \n \n \n \nJOSEPH LEE JONES,                \n \n Petitioner,  \n \nv.       CASE NO.  20-3056 -SAC  \n \nDOUGLAS COUNTY JAIL , \n \n Respondent.  \n \n \n \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER  \nThis matter is a pro se  petition for writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  2254. The \nCourt conducted an initial review of the Petition under Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases \nin the United States District Courts and entered an Order to Show Cause (Do c. 18) (“OSC”) directing \nPetitioner to show cause why this matter should not be dismissed.  This matter is before the Court on \nPetitioner’s Response s (Doc s. 22, 24, and 26 ), as well as several motions . \nBackground  \nMr. Jones states he is a pretrial detainee awaiting a competency evaluation in connection \nwith Case No. 2019 -CR-1075 in Douglas County, Kansas.  He has been charged with two drug -\nrelated felony offenses as well as driving while his license is suspended.  P etitioner complains \nabout the amount of time between his arrest and the order for a competency evaluation, the amount \nof time it takes for the evaluation to occur, and the need for another evaluation when he was \npreviously found to be incompetent.  He also  complains about an incident that occurred at the \nDouglas County Jail.  Petitioner requests release from custody.       Case 5:20-cv-03056-SAC   Document 51   Filed 03/15/21   Page 1 of 52 \n On May 29, 2020, this Court entered the OSC, directed Petitioner to show good cause why \nhis Petition should not be dismissed for failure  to exhaust his state court remedies and based on \nabstention.   \nAnalysis  \nThe Court found in the OSC that Petitioner had not satisfied the exhaustion prerequisite to \nseeking habeas relief in federal court.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(b)(1) .  Petitioner has filed numerous \nresponses, memoranda, motions, and supplements in this matter.  One, ECF No. 45, purports to \nshow that he has exhausted his state court remedies.  While it shows he had a habeas corpus action \nsummarily dismissed by the Kansas Supreme Court, Petitioner has not shown that the issues raised \nthere were the same as the issues he raises he re. \nAs for the issues Petitioner raises here, he claims his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth \nAmendment rights were violated in addition to the Kansas statute s related to competency \nproceedings , K.S.A. 22 -3301, et seq.   He states the decision or action he is c hallenging is “staying \nof court proceedings beyond limits 60, 90 days – K.S.A. 22 -3301, 22 -3302, 22 -3303.”  ECF No. \n1, at 2.   \nWhile Petitioner cites constitutional amendments, his argument is based entirely on state \nlaw.  “A habeas petitioner is only enti tled to relief, however, for alleged violations  of federal rights, \nnot for errors of state law.”   Bullock v. Carver , 297 F.3d 1036, 1055 (10th Cir. 2002) ( citing Estelle \nv. McGuire , 502 U.S. 62, 67 (1991)); Blaurock v. Kansas , 686 F. App’x  597, 613 (10th Cir. 2017).  \n“[I]t is not the province of a federal  habeas  court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-\nlaw questions. ”  Estelle , 502 U.S. at 67 -68.   \nEven if Petitioner had done more than merely list constitutional amendments, he  has not \nraised a valid claim for violation of his federal constitutional right to a speedy trial.  “In Case 5:20-cv-03056-SAC   Document 51   Filed 03/15/21   Page 2 of 53 \n determining whether a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to a speedy  trial has been violated , a \ncourt must balance four factors: (1) the length of delay; (2) the reason for delay; (3) the defendant’s \nassertion of his right; and (4) any prejudice to the defendant.”  United States  v. Toombs , 574 F.3d \n1262, 1274 (10th Cir. 2009).  However, a court  only reach es the final three factors of this analysis \nif it first determine s the delay is presumptively prejudicial.  Id. (“The first factor, length of delay, \nfunctions as a triggering mechanism and the remaining factors are examined only if the delay is \nlong enough to be presumptively prejudicial.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Jackson v. Ray , \n390 F.3d 1254, 1262 (10th Cir. 2004).  Delays approaching one year are generally considered \npresumptively prejudicial.  See Doggett v. United States , 505 U.S. 647, 652 n.1 (1992); United \nStates  v. Batie , 433 F.3d 1287, 1290 (10th Cir. 2006) (“Delays approaching one year generally \nsatisfy the requirement of presumptive prejudice.”); Jackson , 390 F.3d at 1262.  Because the delay \ninvolved here appear to  fall short of a presumptively prejudicial delay, the other factors are not \nreached and Petitioner  has not made a valid claim of the denial of his constitutional right  to a \nspeedy trial . \nMoreover, e ven if Petitioner had shown presumptively prejudicial dela y, his speedy trial \nclaim would be foreclosed by the issue of his  competency to stand trial.  “It is well established that \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the criminal prosecution of a \ndefendant who is not competent to stand tr ial.”  Medina v. California , 505 U.S. 437, 439 (1992).   \nPetitioner, in his many filings, makes other allegations and attempts to raise other claims.  \nFor example, i n a supplement to the Petition, he alleges  that China has developed a God Machine \nthat tells the police and the courts what to do.  ECF No. 5, at 4.  Mr. Jones states, “I want released \nas the whole world shall become my prison.”  ECF No. 5, at 2.  In another supplement, he \ncomplains about an incid ent where a jail official refused to accept an outgoing letter because he Case 5:20-cv-03056-SAC   Document 51   Filed 03/15/21   Page 3 of 54 \n did not have a stamp on it.  ECF No.7, at 2.  Petitioner then filed exhibits in support of that claim.  \nSee ECF No. 9.  He also file d a memorandum asking the Court to order the Dougl as County Jail \nto create a new rulebook and grievance protocol to match federal and Kansas Department of \nCorrections standards.   See ECF No. 39.  Finally, in his Petition, he claims, “On 01 -14-2020 \nDouglas County Jail officer inadvertently asked an inmate to assault a mentally ill inmate.”   \nAny claims Petitioner has challenging the conditions of his confinement do not arise under \nSection 2241.  See McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm’n , 115 F.3d 809, 811 -12 (10th Cir. \n1997).  Petitioner may not bring his  claims regarding conditions at the Douglas County Jail or \nincidents that occurred there in a habeas corpus action; rather, he must proceed, if at all, in a civil \nrights action.  The Court finds these claims are not properly before the Court and offers no opinion \non their merits.  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the Petition must be denied . \nPending Motions  \nPetitioner has filed seven pending motions, three of which are motions for preliminary \ninjunctive relief.  ECF No. 23 asks the Court to order a Douglas County District Court judge to \nstop forcing him to use his appointed attorney and to order the Douglas County Jail  to change its \nlegal mail postage policy.  See ECF No. 23.  ECF No. 30 asks the Court to strike presentence \ninvestigative reports of all kinds past and present.  ECF No. 36 asks the Court to order the Douglas \nCounty Jail to allow grievances to be heard and  stop violation of Petitioner’s civil right to access \nthe courts.  See ECF No. 36, at 3.   \nA movant seeking a preliminary injunction to remedy an alleged constitutional violation \nmust establish “four factors: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits [of h is described claim]; (2) \na likelihood that [he] will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the Case 5:20-cv-03056-SAC   Document 51   Filed 03/15/21   Page 4 of 55 \n balance of equities tips in [his] favor; and (4) that the injunction is in the public interest.”  White \nv. Kansas Dep't of Corr. , 617 F. App'x 901, 904 (10th Cir. 2015)  (quoting  RoDa Drilling Co.  v. \nSiegal , 552 F.3d 1203,  1208  (10th Cir. 2009) ).  \nThe Court cannot find that success on the merits is likely and or that Petitioner will suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief.  As a result, Petitioner’s motion s for injunctive \nrelief (ECF Nos. 23, 30, and 36) are  denied.   \nPetitioner’s remaining motions request that the Court order the state court to release him \non bond (ECF Nos. 38 and 43), reconsideration of the decisions to deny him, as a three -strikes \nlitigant, in forma pauperis status in two of his civil rights cases (ECF No. 41), and \nacknowledgement that there has been “A.I.” (artificial intelligence) intervention in his various \ncases (E CF No. 44).  Because the Petition is denied and because the motions lack merit,  all pending \nmotions are denied.  \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  that the Petition  is denied .   \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED  that Petitioner’s pending motions (ECF Nos . 23, 30, 36, \n38, 41, 43, and 44 ) are denied . \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDATED:  This 15th day of March, 2021, at Topeka, Kansas.  \n \n      s/_Sam A.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Cody Clark filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft Corporation, alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The lawsuit concerns the use of Brainshark's AI-driven video coaching software, which employs Microsoft's Azure cloud services and Azure Cognitive Services to analyze facial expressions, allegedly involving biometric data. The court granted in part Microsoft's motion to dismiss, allowing Clark's claim regarding possession of biometric data under BIPA's section 15(a) to proceed, while dismissing other claims with leave to amend.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Microsoft is liable under BIPA for actively obtaining, possessing, profiting from, or disseminating biometric data allegedly processed through its services.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed Clark's claims under sections 15(b) and 15(d) of BIPA due to insufficient allegations that Microsoft took active steps to obtain or disseminate biometric data. The section 15(c) claim was dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, as Clark failed to demonstrate personal harm from the alleged profiting. However, the court allowed the section 15(a) claim to proceed, finding plausible allegations regarding Microsoft's possession and control over biometric data.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Cody Clark sued Microsoft because a software tool he used for work, which helps evaluate his sales pitches, might have used his face data incorrectly. He claimed Microsoft did things like making money from his face data without his permission. The judge said Clark didn't show enough to prove all his claims, like Microsoft actively trying to get or share his face data. But, one claim can continue because it's possible that Microsoft had control over the data, which might mean they have some responsibility. Clark can try to fix his complaints and bring them back to court.",

Comp. Stat. 14/1 et seq. Microsoft \nnow moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss \neach of Clark’s claims. I have subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d). For the following reasons, the motion is granted in part and denied in part. \nI. \n According to the complaint, while Clark worked as a salesperson for CONMED, he used “video-based coaching” software Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 1 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n provided by Brainshark, Inc. (“Brainshark”). Compl., ECF 1-1 ¶¶ 8, \n45. That software allows a salesperson to record a video of himself and upload it to Brainshark’s platform, which then automatically generates feedback about his “elevator pitch.” Id. ¶ 9. To provide \nthis feedback, Brainshark’s software analyzes facial expressions \nusing facial geometry scans from the uploaded video. Id. ¶¶ 9–10.\n1 \n Brainshark’s software allegedly “interfaces with and/or integrates” two Microsoft products: its Azure cloud services (“Azure”) and Azure Cognitive Services applications (“ACS”). Id. \n¶ 8. “Public cloud[s]” like Azure “allow[] users to, inter alia , \nbuild and deploy applications; store data; deliver software on demand; and analyze data using machine learning and artificial \nintelligence.” Id. ¶ 7. ACS “help[s] developers build cognitive \nsolutions (that can see, hear, speak, and analyze) into their applications.” Id. \n In addition to the allegations in the complaint, Microsoft requests that I take judicial notice of its Products and Services Data Protection Addendum (“DPA”), ECF 16-1, which it says applies to Azure and ACS. Clark does not oppose consideration of this document, and in fact uses it in some of his arguments. Because \nthe document is publicly available, it is a “matter of public \n \n1 A BIPA case against Brainshark in this district was recently \ndismissed by stipulation of the parties. See Wilk v. Brainshark, \nInc., No. 1:21-cv-4794 (N.D. Ill. July 26, 2023), ECF 57.

Suarez v. AbbVie, Inc. , \n503 F. Supp. 3d 711, 721–22 (N.D. Ill. 2020) (citing Cause of \nAction v. Chi. Transit Auth. , 815 F.3d 267, 277 n.13 (7th Cir. \n2016)). \nII. \n“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. \n544, 570 (2007)). “A claim is facially plausible ‘when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.’” Law Offs. of David Freydin, P.C. v. Chamara , \n24 F.4th 1122, 1128 (7th Cir. 2022) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n678). I accept well-pleaded facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiff’s favor, but I am “not bound to accept legal conclusions as true.” Burger v.

Microsoft maintains that \nClark’s section 15(b) claim should be dismissed because he failed to plausibly allege that Microsoft took an “active step” to obtain his biometric data. In response, Clark focuses only on whether \nMicrosoft “receive[d] through trade” or “otherwise obtain[ed]” the \ndata, and argues that section 15(b) does not require an active step and that, in any event, he has plausibly alleged one.  I agree with Microsoft and the weight of authority in this district that section 15(b) liability requires an active step in obtaining biometrics. See, e.g. , Jones v. Microsoft Corp. , No. 22-\ncv-3437, 2023 WL 130495, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 9, 2023) (applying “active step” requirement to section 15(b) claim); Patterson v. \nRespondus, Inc. , 593 F. Supp. 3d 783, 824 (N.D. Ill. 2022) (same); \nKing v. PeopleNet Corp. , No. 21 CV 2774, 2021 WL 5006692, at *8 \n(N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2021) (same); Jacobs v. Hanwha Techwin Am., \nInc., No. 21 C 866, 2021 WL 3172967, at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 21, \n2021) (same). The Illinois legislature premised BIPA sections 15(a), (c), (d), and (e) on “possession” of biometrics, but chose not to use that term in section 15(b). That choice matters. See \nChi. Teachers Union, Local No. 1 v. Bd. of Educ. of the City of \n \n2 Though BIPA defines “biome tric identifier” and “biometric \ninformation” independently, see 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/10, I use \nthem interchangeably in this opinion, along with the terms \n“biometric data” or “biometrics.” The terms’ distinctions make no \ndifference for present purposes. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n Chi., 963 N.E.2d 918, 925 (Ill. 2012) (“When the legislature \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same statute, courts presume that the legislature acted intentionally and purposely in the inclusion or \nexclusion, and that the legislature intended different meanings \nand results.” (citations omitted)).  \nThe term “otherwise obtain” is also best construed as \nrequiring something beyond passive possession or receipt. The \nparties put forth dueling dictionary definitions of the word “obtain”--Microsoft’s preferred definition makes the verb active, while Clark’s makes it passive. See Obtain , Black’s Law Dictionary  \n(11th ed. 2019) (“[t]o bring into one’s own possession; to procure, \nesp. through effort”); Vance v. Microsoft Corp. , 525 F. Supp. 3d \n1287, 1297 (W.D. Wash. 2021) (“‘[t]o come into the possession of,’ or ‘to get, acquire, or secure’” (quoting Obtain, Oxford English \nDictionary , https://www.oed.com/dictionary/obtain_v (last visited \nAugust 21, 2023))). But because “otherwise obtain” comes at the end of a list of active verbs,\n3 the more active definition is the \nbetter one here. See Pooh-Bah Enters., Inc. v. County of Cook , 905 \nN.E.2d 781, 799 (Ill. 2009) (“[W]hen a statutory clause \nspecifically describes several classes of persons or things and \n \n3 “Receive” alone need not be active, but to “receive through \ntrade” requires the active step of engaging in trade with some \nother entity. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n then includes ‘other persons or things,’ the word ‘other’ is \ninterpreted to mean ‘other such like.’” (citation omitted)).4 \nClark cautions that applying an active step requirement to \nsection 15(b) is tantamount to “rewrit[ing] [BIPA] to create new \nelements or limitations not included by the legislature,” in \ncontravention of Illinois Supreme Court caselaw. Cothron v. White \nCastle Sys., Inc. , -- N.E.3d --, 2023 WL 4567389, at *7 (Ill. Feb. \n17, 2023). Indeed, according to Clark,  the federal courts that had \npreviously observed such a requirement can no longer be considered good law after Cothron. But Cothron merely reiterated rules of \nstatutory construction that have been around for many years, and certainly since BIPA has been enacted. While true that section \n15(b) nowhere says the words “active step,” the statutory \nconstruction offered above shows that, “[u]nder a commonsense \nreading,” “the private entity must undertake some effort to collect or obtain biometric identifiers or information.” Jones, 2023 WL \n130495, at *3; see id.  (“[T]his concept simply describes the \nunifying characteristic among the verbs in the statute.”).  The complaint does not sufficiently allege that Microsoft took an active step in obtaining Clark’s biometric data. There are \n \n4 As for Clark’s argument that Microsoft receives his biometrics \nthrough trade, the complaint lacks allegations of a “transaction \nor swap” by which Microsoft received biometrics. See Trade, Black’s \nLaw Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019). Instead, I agree with Microsoft \nthat the allegations suggest it provided its technology in exchange \nfor payment by Brainshark. See Compl. ¶¶ 33–34. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n repeated allegations that, for Brainshark to conduct its analysis \nof sales employees, it “(1) collects, captures, and/or otherwise obtains; (2) stores; and/or (3) makes use of such individuals’ biometric identifiers (namely, scans of facial geometry) and \nbiometric information.” Compl. ¶¶ 10, 40; see also id.  ¶ 46 \n(similar). From there, Clark alleges that because “Brainshark’s software interfaces with and/or integrates Azure and/or ACS, Defendant Microsoft also (1) collects, captures, and/or otherwise obtains; (2) stores; and/or (3) makes use of such individuals’ biometric identifiers and biometric information.” Id. ¶¶ 11, 41; \nsee also  id. ¶¶ 13, 43, 47 (similar). That alone is a conclusory \njump, and the complaint does not elsewhere allege facts sufficient \nto draw the inference that Microsoft actively obtained Clark’s \nbiometrics. Indeed, the complaint makes clear that Microsoft provides technology to Brainshark and that Brainshark allegedly uses that technology to collect Clark’s biometrics. See, e.g. , id. \n¶ 7 (alleging that Azure is “a public cloud” that “allow[s] users \nto” perform various tasks (emphasis added)); id. ¶ 29 (describing \nACS as “cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services that help developers  build cognitive intelligence into applications” \nand “easily add cognitive features into their applications with \ncognitive solutions that can see, hear, speak, and analyze” (emphasis added) (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also  id. ¶¶ 28, 30–32. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n  Rivera v. Amazon Web Services  offers a helpful contrast. No. \n2:22-cv-00269, 2023 WL 4761481 (W.D. Wash. July 26, 2023). There, the court found sufficient for section 15(b) purposes the plaintiff’s allegations that the defe ndant could “access” and \n“extract” biometric data uploaded by an intermediary, and that it \nwas “involve[d] in the data collection process . . . beyond simply providing the technology to” another entity. Id. at *5; see also \nMayhall ex rel. D.M. v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc. , No. 2:21-cv-\n01473-TL, 2023 WL 2728292, at *1, *3 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 31, 2023) (finding active step where defendant “use[d] its computing power . . . to collect facial features vectors from face-scan data,” “construct[ed] a 3D face geometry of the user,” and “transmit[ted] \nthe [f]ace [g]eometry to [video game] players’ [g]aming \n[p]latforms”). Clark’s other cases are similarly distinguishable because in those cases, the defendants allegedly played active roles in obtaining biometrics. For example, in Johnson v. NCR \nCorp., the court upheld a section 15(b) claim where the plaintiff \nalleged the defendant actively managed, maintained, and stored biometric data and that defendant’s system itself captured the biometrics in the first place and used them to create templates \nthat could be employed for identification purposes. No. 22 C 3061, \n2023 WL 1779774, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 6, 2023). Here, as far as I can tell from the complaint, Microsoft provided technology to Brainshark, plus storage. That is not an active step. See Jones , Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 8 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n 2023 WL 130495, at *4 (finding providing storage did not constitute \n“active step”); Jacobs, 2021 WL 3172967, at *3 (finding provision \nof technology did not constitute “active step”); Namuwonge v. \nKronos, Inc. , 418 F. Supp. 3d 279, 286 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (same).5 \n Nor does the DPA help. Many of the portions Clark cites \ndescribe what Microsoft does with data in its possession, but as explained above, possessing data does not suffice for a section 15(b) claim. And though the DPA at one point references how “Personal Data processed by Microsoft in connection with providing the Products and Services is obtained,” DPA at 8, the DPA goes on to indicate that some such data is “sent to” Microsoft, id., which \nwould not constitute an active step. In any event, the complaint \nis silent on whether Microsoft “processes” the alleged biometric \ndata at issue here. Additionally, as used in the DPA, “obtained” could assume its passive, rather than active, meaning. I would need to make more than one speculative leap to infer that Microsoft took an active step to obtain Clark’s data based on the DPA.  \n \n5 In his response brief, Clark argues that Brainshark “has to \nprovide the relevant videos to Microsoft, from which Microsoft \nextracts biometric data using” Azure and ACS “before returning the \nbiometric data to Brainshark.” Resp., ECF 24 at 10 (citing Compl. \n¶¶ 13, 28, 33, 37–43). I do not understand the cited paragraphs of \nthe complaint to support that contention. To the extent he has a \ngood faith basis to allege that is what actually happens--that is, \nthat Brainshark sends the videos to Microsoft, Microsoft extracts \nbiometric data, and then sends the biometric data back to \nBrainshark--he should so allege in any amended complaint. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n B. \n Clark’s remaining claims, under sections 15(a), (c), and (d), each require that Microsoft was “in possession of” Clark’s biometrics. 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(a), (c), (d). The parties \nagree that the ordinary meaning of “possession” applies here, which \nis “‘the act or condition of having in or taking into one’s control or holding at one’s disposal.’” People v. Ward , 830 N.E.2d 556, \n560 (Ill. 2005) (quoting Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1770 (1986)). \nConsidering the DPA, it is plausible that Microsoft was “in \npossession” of Clark’s biometric data. The DPA states that Microsoft “control[s] access to Customer Data and Professional \nServices Data (including any Personal Data therein).” DPA at 9.\n6 \nIn its reply brief, Microsoft does not address this portion of the DPA. And because the complaint alleges that Brainshark is hosted on Azure’s servers, see Compl. ¶ 35, I can reasonably infer that \nthe biometric data allegedly collected by Brainshark was on Microsoft’s servers and that, once there, Microsoft exercised some degree of control over access to that data. While data storage alone may be insufficient, storage of data together with the \n \n6 The DPA defines “Customer Data” to include “video” or “image \nfiles” “that are provided to Microsoft by” customers. DPA at 5. \n“Personal Data” includes information “specific to the physical \n[or] physiological . . . identity” of a natural person. Id. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n ability to control access to that data adequately pleads \npossession. \nC. \n Microsoft independently attacks Clark’s section 15(c) claim, \nasserting the complaint does not sufficiently allege that \nMicrosoft “sell[s], “lease[s], trade[s], or otherwise profit[s] from” his biometrics. 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(c). According to the complaint, Microsoft profited from Clark’s data by using it to “further refine its technologies and/or provide services to its clients.” Compl. ¶ 73.  But Clark has not sufficiently alleged an injury-in-fact to confer Article III standing with respect to this claim. “Standing \nis an element of subject-matter jurisdiction in a federal civil \naction,” Moore v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , 908 F.3d 1050, 1057 (7th \nCir. 2018), and though Microsoft does not argue for dismissal or remand of this claim on those grounds, courts “have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party,” Arbaugh \nv. Y & H Corp. , 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006) (citation omitted). The \nSeventh Circuit has characterized section 15(c) as a “general \nregulatory rule” that “no one may profit in the specified ways \nfrom another person’s” biometric data, and that pleading a bare violation of this provision is not enough for standing purposes. Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc. , 984 F.3d 1241, 1246–47 (7th Cir. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n 2021). In Thornley , the Seventh Circuit held that a section 15(c) \nplaintiff must allege more than that the defendant profited from their data; they must allege how that conduct harmed them individually. Id. at 1247. The Seventh Circuit identified examples \nof allegations a plaintiff could allege to establish injury-in-\nfact, like, “for example, that by selling her data, the collector has deprived her of the opportunity to profit from her biometric information”; “that the act of selling her data amplified the invasion of her privacy that occurred when the data was first collected, by disseminating it to some unspecified number of other people”; or that defendant’s use of the biometric data “raise[d] the cost” of using some other product or service, like a social \nmedia website. Id. \nClark’s complaint fails to plausibly allege more than a bare \nstatutory violation of section 15(c). Indeed, courts in this district have found allegations like those in Clark’s complaint insufficient for standing. See, e.g. , Gorgas v. Amazon.com, Inc. , \nNo. 22 CV 5159, 2023 4173051, at *2 (N.D. Ill. June 23, 2023) (dismissing claim where allegation was that “Amazon profits . . . by using this biometric data to improve the Rekognition technology \nthat Amazon uses itself and also sells to [various \norganizations]”); Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. , No. 21 C 3169, 2022 \nWL 952763, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 30, 2022) (same where allegation was that Amazon “used the images uploaded to Amazon Photos to train Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n Rekognition, which it then sold to third parties”); Patterson , 593 \nF. Supp. 3d at 816 (same where allegation was that defendant profited from biometric data by marketing their product). Even if Microsoft used Clark’s data to improve Azure and ACS, which it \nsells to other entities, that does not explain how doing so harmed \nClark. \nD. \n Finally, Microsoft argues that Clark’s section 15(d) claim fails because the complaint does not support that Microsoft “disclose[d], redisclose[d], or otherwise disseminate[d]” Clark’s data. 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(d). I agree. In his brief, Clark characterizes the requisite conduct as “Microsoft’s disclosure or \ndissemination of the biometric data to Brainshark so that \nBrainshark could provide its services,” Resp. at 19, a statement for which he cites to complaint paragraphs 33–35 and 46–49. I take those allegations to mean that Microsoft provides its Azure and ACS technology to Brainshark and other customers, but nothing in those allegations indicates disclosure, redisclosure, or dissemination of biometric data from Microsoft to Brainshark. See \nJones, 2023 WL 130495, at *5 (dismissing section 15(d) claim where \nno allegation that defendant disseminated data to “any third-party \ndata centers or any tangible third parties whatsoever”). And the fact that the DPA states that “Microsoft may hire Subprocessors to Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 13 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf,” DPA \nat 11, does not bring this claim from speculative to plausible. \nIII. \n For the foregoing reasons, Microsoft’s motion is denied with \nrespect to Clark’s section 15(a) claim. Clark’s claims under \nsection 15(b) and (d) are dismissed without prejudice for failure to state a claim. See O’Brien v. Vill. of Lincolnshire , 955 F.3d \n616, 628 (7th Cir. 2020) (noting plaintiff should usually have at least one opportunity to amend). His claim under section 15(c) is dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See Lauderdale-El v. Ind. Parole Bd. , 35 F.4th 572, \n576 (7th Cir. 2022) (“Dismissals for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction are necessarily without prejudice.” (citation \nomitted)). To the extent Clark is able, consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, to remedy the issues I identify above, he may file an amended complaint within 30 days of entry of this memorandum opinion and order. If no amended complaint is filed by then, his claims under sections 15(b) and (d) will be dismissed with prejudice and the section 15(c) claim will be severed and remanded to state court. \n \n   Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 14 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n  ENTER ORDER:  \n \n \n_____________________________ \n     Elaine E.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Erik M. Underwood and My24HourNews.com, Inc. filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Bank of America (BofA) claiming that BofA's use of the service mark \"ERICA\" in its virtual financial assistant infringed on their unregistered \"E.R.I.C.A.\" mark. The court affirmed the district court’s decision, granting summary judgment to BofA and finding that the plaintiffs failed to establish that their use of the \"E.R.I.C.A.\" mark clearly distinguished their services, thus lacking a protectable interest in the mark. The case involves artificial intelligence (AI) as the plaintiffs claimed to have a virtual assistant service mark \"E.R.I.C.A.\", while BofA's ERICA is also a virtual financial assistant.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the plaintiffs have a protectable interest in the unregistered service mark \"E.R.I.C.A.\" through actual use in commerce, prior to BofA's use of the similar mark \"ERICA\".\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate actual use in commerce of the \"E.R.I.C.A.\" mark in a way that clearly distinguished and identified their offered services. Therefore, they did not establish a protectable interest in the mark, affirming the summary judgment for BofA.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a unique name for a service that you think no one else is using, and you don’t register it officially. But when a big company starts using a similar name for their service, you try to claim they’re taking your name. The court looked into it and decided that you weren’t really using your cool name in a way that made it clear what your service was, so the big company didn’t actually steal your thunder.",

(collectively, plaintiffs) \nappeal the district court’ s order granting summary judg ment to defendant Bank of \nAmerica (BofA) on their trademark-infri ngement claim for the service mark \n“E.R.I.C.A.” Because plaintif fs fail to establish any tr iable issue of fact about \nwhether the service mark clea rly distinguished the services  offered, they cannot show \na protectable interest in their unr egistered mark, and we affirm.  \n \n* This order and judgment is not bi nding precedent, except under the doctrines \nof law of the case, res judi cata, and collateral estoppel.

Wolpert \nClerk of Court  Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 1 2 \n Background \nIn October 2010, Underwood obtained a Georgia state trademark registration \nfor the mark “E.R.I.C.A.” Plaintiffs later launched th e website www.my24erica.com, \nwhich allows users to search for movi es and actors in its online database.1 \nIn October 2016, BofA filed an inte nt-to-use application for the mark \n“ERICA” with the United States Patent an d Trademark Office (USPTO). After the \nUSPTO approved the application, BofA launched ERICA as a virtual financial \nassistant in its mobile ba nking application, and the USPTO formally issued the \nERICA registration to Bo fA in July 2018.  \nPlaintiffs then filed this  action, asserting as rele vant here that BofA was \ninfringing on their trademark. The district  court granted BofA’s motion to cancel \nplaintiffs’ Georgia trademark registrati on and its motion for summary judgment.  \nPlaintiffs appealed, and we  affirmed the trademark cancellation and much of \nthe summary-judgment order, but we vacated and remanded on a single issue—\nwhether plaintiffs had establ ished protectable trademark rights through a theory of \nactual use of the E.R.I.C. A. mark in commerce. See Underwood v. Bank of Am. \nCorp. , 996 F.3d 1038, 1059 (10th Ci r. 2021). Setting out the correct legal framework \nfor assessing “actual use,” we remanded for the district c ourt to determine whether \nplaintiffs could establish that: (1) www.my24erica.com was publicly accessible \n \n1 The parties dispute the date on which this website became publicly \naccessible: plaintiffs as sert it was in March 2015; BofA  contends it was not until June \n2018. As we later explain, th is dispute is not material to  our decision; for purposes of \nthis appeal, we accept plaintif fs’ alleged date of publication.  Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 2 3 \n before October 2016; (2) search-engine and personal-assistant services on the website \n“were ‘rendered to others’ before Octobe r 2016”; and (3) “the E.R.I.C.A. mark \n‘clearly identif[ied] and di stinguish[ed]’ the services offered ‘on the website.’” Id. at \n1057 (alterations in original) (first quoting Morningside Grp. Ltd. v. Morningside \nCap. Grp., L.L.C. , 182 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir. 1999), and then quoting 2 J. Thomas \nMcCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Un fair Competition § 16:32.70 (5th ed. \nMar. 2021 update)). \nOn remand, the district court again granted summary judgment for BofA, \nfinding that (1) even assuming the website  was publicly accessible before October \n2016, plaintiffs failed to cr eate a genuine issue of materi al fact as to  (2) whether \nplaintiffs rendered search-e ngine and personal-assistant services to others and \n(3) whether the mark clearl y identified and distinguished  the services offered by \nwww.my24erica.com. It later denied plai ntiffs’ motion for reconsideration.  \nPlaintiffs appeal. \nAnalysis \nPlaintiffs challenge summary judgm ent for BofA on their trademark-\ninfringement claim. We re view a summary-judgment or der de novo and apply the \nsame legal standard as  the district court.  GeoMetWatch Corp. v. Behunin , 38 F.4th \n1183, 1200 (10th Cir.  2022). Summary judgment is pr oper when there is “no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the mova nt is entitled to j udgment as a matter of \nlaw,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), meaning that a reasonable jury  could not return a verdict \nfor the nonmoving party, see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 248 Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 3 4 \n (1986). On summary judgment, we view all facts and inferences in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmoving party. GeoMetWatch , 38 F.4th at 1200. \n As we explained in our prior decision in  this case, “[t]he principle underlying \ntrademark protection is that  distinctive marks—words, names, symbols, and the \nlike—can help distinguish a particular artisan’s goods from those of others.” \nUnderwood , 996 F.3d at 1045 (quoting B&B Hardware, Inc. v.  Hargis Indus., Inc. , \n575 U.S. 138, 142 (2015)). And the overarc hing “rule of trademark ownership in the \nUnited States is priority of use,” establis hed by using a symbol or word to identify \nand distinguish the sour ce of goods of services. Id. (quoting 2 J. Thomas McCarthy, \nMcCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 16:1 (5th ed. Mar. 2021 \nupdate)). To establish a claim for trad emark infringement under federal law, “a \nplaintiff must show ‘(1) that the plaintif f has a protectable in terest in the mark; \n(2) that the defendant has used  an identical or similar mark  in commerce; and (3) that \nthe defendant’s use is likel y to confuse customers.’” Id. (quoting 1-800 Contacts, Inc. \nv. Lens.com, Inc. , 722 F.3d 1229, 1238 (10th Cir. 2013). For purposes of this appeal, \nwe assume that the last two el ements are established. So at  issue here, as in the prior \nappeal, is only the first elem ent: a protectable interest. See id.  at 1052–53.  \n A plaintiff can establish a protectable interest in an  unregistered service mark \nthrough “actual use in the market.” Id. at 1053 (quoting  Allard Enters., Inc. v. \nAdvanced Programming Res., Inc. , 146 F.3d 350, 354 (6th Cir. 1998)). To do so, a \n“plaintiff must show use of the mark as a service mark, which means use ‘to identify \nand distinguish the services of one person . . . from the services  of others and to Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 4 5 \n indicate the source of the services, even if that  source is unknown.’” Id. (quoting 15 \nU.S.C. § 1127). And actual use must take place in commerce,  meaning that it consists \nof “attempt[s] to complete genuine commerc ial transactions,” as  opposed to uses \nmerely intended “to reserve a mark for later use.” Id. at 1053–54 (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Allard Enters. , 146 F.3d at 359). As partic ularly relevant here, use \nof a mark on a website “may constitute a bona fide use in commerce,” but “the \nwebsite must ‘identify [the] goo ds or services . . . provid ed through or in connection \nwith the website.’” Id. at 1054 (alteration in original) (quoting Specht v. Google, Inc. , \n747 F.3d 929, 934 (7 th Cir. 2014)).  \nHere, as to actual use in commerce, re call that the district court assumed \nplaintiffs’ website was public ly accessible before Oct ober 2016 but c oncluded both \nthat plaintiffs did not render search-engine and personal-ass istant services to others \nand that plaintiffs’ use of the mark di d not clearly identify and distinguish the \nservices they provided. We will similarly assume public  accessibility and will go one \nstep further and assume that plaintif fs did render servic es to others.  \nTurning our focus to whethe r plaintiffs’ use of the ma rk clearly identified and \ndistinguished their services, we first note th at the district cour t’s analysis on this \npoint lacked detail. It simply stated that plaintiffs’ use di d not meet this standard and \noffered as an “example” that “[p]lainti ffs point[ed] to no evidence that any \nindividuals who visited its we bsite during that timeframe associated the mark with \nthe website’s services.”  App. vol. 7, 1658.  \nTaking off from this example, plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 5 6 \n “erred by requiring  proof that a particular indivi dual subjectively associated the \nERICA mark with the website’s services.”2 Aplt. Br. 19 (emphasis added). But as \ndefendant identifies, the phrase “for example” indicates that the district court did not \nrequire  such subjective proof; rather, it merely  noted the absence of such proof when \nconcluding that the use of the mark on the website did not clearly identify and \ndistinguish the services provided. And it is not clear that doing so was erroneous: \neven plaintiffs acknowledge that this  inquiry turns on the totality of the \ncircumstances and thus could include  the possibility of subjective proof. See \nPlanetary Motion, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc. , 261 F.3d 1188, 1195–96 (11th Cir. \n2001) (explaining that courts look at tota lity of circumstances to determine use in \ncommerce, including “evidence that members of the ta rgeted public actually \nassociated the mark . . . with the [good or service] to  which it was affixed”). In any \nevent, we need not definiti vely resolve whether the dist rict court erred by discussing \nthe lack of subjective evid ence in this case. We must simply assess, on de novo \nreview, whether plaintiffs can show a genuine  issue of material fact on actual use in \ncommerce based on the totali ty of the circumstances.  \n \n2 Plaintiffs also argue that the distri ct court erred by pr oviding inadequate \nnotice of the basis for its ruling. But our prior decision included significant detail \nabout the three issues to be decided on re mand, and the district court ordered the \nparties to file supplemental briefing addressing those issues . Then, the district court \nissued its summary-judgment ruling based on those three issues. So we reject \nplaintiffs’ notice argument. Cf. Oldham v. O.K. Farms, Inc. , 871 F.3d 1147, 1150–51 \n(10th Cir. 2017) (fi nding plaintiff was prejudiced by district court’s grant of \nsummary judgment on ground not raised or  addressed by either party and instead \nraised sua sponte by c ourt during hearing).  Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 6 7 \n  Seeking to do so, plaintiffs point to  the About ERICA and Terms of Service \nsections of the website, whic h both mention either “E.R.I.C .A.” or “ERICA.” As an \ninitial matter, to reach either  of these webpages, a website  visitor must scroll to the \nbottom of the information-heavy homepage and locate and click on a link in small-\npoint, all-lowercase font in  the bottom right corner.3 Such an obscure use of the mark \nis unlikely to “‘clearly id entif[y] and distinguish’ th e services offered ‘on the \nwebsite.’” Underwood , 996 F.3d at 1057 (quoting 2 J.  Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy \non Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 16:32.70 (5th ed. Mar. 2021 update)); see \nalso In re Osterberg , 83 U.S.P.Q.2d 1220, at *3 (T.T.A.B. 2007) (finding no \nconnection between use of mark and goods where “viewers of the webpage will have \nto search through the descriptive te xt even to find the purported mark”); In re Azteca \nSystems, Inc. , 102 U.S.P.Q.2d 1955, at *1–3 (T.T .A.B. 2012) (finding no connection \nbetween use of mark and goods  where “the mark [wa]s dist ant from the description of \nthe software, . . . separated from the descri ption by more than fifteen lines of text \nconcerning marginally[ ]rela ted topics,” and located “i n the lower[,] left-hand, \nbottom corner of th e first webpage”).  \n Moreover, even if a website visitor manages to reach these linked webpages, \nthese pages still do not establish “E.R.I.C.A .” as a protectable service mark. The use \nof a service mark must allo w for a “direct asso ciation” between the mark and the \nservices offered. In re Vicki Roberts , 87 U.S.P.Q.2d 1474, at *3 (T.T.A.B. 2008) \n \n3 For reference, we attach  an image of the homepage as an appendix to this \nOrder and Judgment. See App. vol. 6, 1443–45. Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 7 8 \n (quoting In re N.V. Organon , 79 U.S.P.Q2d 1639, 1649 (T.T.A.B. 2006)). And it is \nnot “enough that the mark and a reference to the services both appear in the same” \nlocation. In re Osmotica Holdings Corp. , 95 U.S.P.Q.2d 1666, at *3 (T.T.A.B. 2010).  \n Here, the webpages at issue do not allo w for a direct asso ciation between the \nmark and the services offere d. The About ERICA webpage st ates that “[t]he acronym \nE.R.I.C.A[.] stands for Electronic Repetiti ous Informational Clone Application” and \ndescribes “ERICA” as “an artif icial intelligence mobile se arch engine that infuses \nsoftware and holographic digital technolog y seamlessly together[,] to create an \nenvironment where your digital device is aliv e and interactive with the consciousness \nof E.R.I.C.A.,” as well as “t he first artificial intelligence to have a personality and a \nreal image.” App. vol. 1, 238. The Term s of Service webpage, under the heading \n“Description of Website Servic es Offered,” states that “ERICA” is “a talking . . . \n[a]rtificial [i]ntelligence[] in teractive search engine.” Id. at 221. These summaries \nmerely describe a technology and do not di rectly connect to th e search services \nprovided in a traditional search box on the homepage of www.my24erica.com. For \none thing, the alleged service mark itself has two, indiscriminately used iterations: \n“E.R.I.C.A.” and “ERICA.”  And perhaps more importan tly, the alleged service \ndescribed on these webpages is aspirational, not definitive.  The “About ERICA” page \nspecifically states that  the application is “[ c]urrently . . . in fu rther development to \nimplement the full vision on mobile and search engines to verbally tell you \ninformation and deliver entertainment news, restaurant reviews, financial updates, \nand so much more.” Id. at 238. These descrip tions do not indicate the source  of any Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 8 9 \n offered search-engine or personal-assistant services; they simply describe the idea \nbehind an application st ill “in development.” Id.  \nPlaintiffs further argue that the us e of the service mark on the website \nestablished its use in commerce because at the top of the hom epage, there is a line of \ntext just below a search bar that reads “ERICA’S CURRENT MOVIE PICKS”; \nplaintiffs say this “demonstrat [es] [E.R.I.C.A.’s] ability to  provide the customer with \nrecommendations.” App. vol. 7, 1557. But this phrase does not clearly identify or \ndistinguish search-engine or personal-assi stant services. Indeed , the word “ERICA” \nin this title appears in the same font, size, and style as the other descriptive terms. See \n1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Tradem arks and Unfair Competition § 3:4 (5th \ned. Mar. 2024 update) (“Some of the comm on markers of whether a word, phrase[,] \nor picture is being used as a trademark are: larger-sized print, all capita l letters or \ninitial capitals, distinctive or different pr int style, color, and prominent position on \nlabel or in advertising.”); see also  In re Post Properties, Inc. , 227 U.S.P.Q. 334, at *2 \n(T.T.A.B. 1985) (finding “use in the manner of a service mark” in part because mark \nwas “set off distinctively from the text of the ad copy in an extremely large typeface” \nand was “not an ordinary informational statement”); Jaymo’s Sauces LLC v. Wendy’s \nCo., No. 19-cv-01026, 2021 WL 4712685,  at *7 (C.D. Ill. Oct. 8, 2021) \n(unpublished) (“[T]he nonprivileged placeme nt and emphasis on other terms coupled \nwith the comparatively small, plain font of the term fail to  adequately demonstrate it \nis being used as a source i ndicator on the bottle labels.” ). If anything, the phrase \n“ERICA’S CURRENT MOVIE PI CKS”, in matching text , implies that a person Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 9 10 \n named Erica is curating suggestions and no t that the mark clearly identifies the \nsource of any services. See 2 J. Thomas McCarthy, Mc Carthy on Trademarks and \nUnfair Competition § 13:2 (5th ed. Mar. 202 4 update) (personal names are subject to \ntrademark protection only if their use “ac quire[s] distinctiven ess and secondary \nmeaning”). \nIn a final attempt to demonstrate actual use in commerce, plaintiffs highlight \nevidence showing, in their view , that visitors to the website associat ed the E.R.I.C.A. \nmark with the services being offered. In support, plainti ffs discuss references to “an \nE.R.I.C.A. search engine” in an affida vit from Kim Opler, Underwood’s former \nroommate, App. vol. 5, 1211, and to “E.R.I .C.A. search results”  in testimony from \nTodd Olson, Underwood’s business colleague , App. vol. 3, 509. But neither of these \nstatements mention the placement of the word “ERICA” on the website, nor do they \nsuggest “that any such placement clearly id entified and distinguished the services \noffered on the website.” Aplee.  Br. 33. And what matters here is whether the mark \nwas actually used in commer ce, meaning that it “identi f[ied] [the] goods or services \n. . . provided through or in connection with the website.” Underwood , 996 F.3d at \n1054 (quoting Specht , 747 F.3d at 934). Without testimony about the placement of \nthe mark, we cannot determine if Opler and Olson naturally associated the mark with \nthe services or if they relied on prior knowledge.  \nIn sum, we agree with the district cour t that plaintiffs pr esented no evidence \nthat the E.R.I.C.A. mark, as used on the website, clearly distinguishes the source of \nthe services offered by www.my24erica.com. Pl aintiffs therefore fail to show actual Appellate Case: 22-1402     Document: 010111034400     Date Filed: 04/18/2024     Page: 10 11 \n use in commerce of their mark, meaning th at they cannot establish a protectable \ninterest in their mark as required for their trademark-infringement claim.4 \nConclusion \nWe affirm summary judgment for BofA on plaintiffs’ trademark-infringement \nclaim because plaintiffs cannot  establish actual use of th eir mark prior to BofA’s \npriority date of October 2016.  \nEntered for the Court \n  Nancy L. Moritz Circuit Judge \n \n4 Because we conclude that the dist rict court correctly  awarded summary \njudgment to BofA, we need not separately  address plaintiffs’ argument that the \ndistrict court later erred in denying  their motion for reconsideration.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The court case involves Ashley Gjovik, a former Apple employee, who filed motions to strike Apple’s affirmative defenses and for a more definite statement regarding Apple's responses to her claims. The court granted in part and denied in part the motion to strike, while denying the motion for a more definite statement, allowing Apple to amend its defenses. Notably, the case discusses the implications of using generative AI in legal proceedings, as Ms. Gjovik's reliance on AI-generated documents drew scrutiny for potentially inaccurate information.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: The primary legal issue centers on the sufficiency and appropriateness of Apple’s affirmative defenses to Ms. Gjovik’s claims, along with the implications of using AI for drafting legal documents without proper verification.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court granted in part and denied in part the motion to strike Apple’s affirmative defenses, allowing Apple an opportunity to amend certain defenses with more concrete allegations. The motion for a more definite statement was denied entirely due to procedural inapplicability and the sufficiency of Apple’s existing responses.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you're playing a game where you have to tell the truth but also defend yourself against accusations. Ashley, who used to work for Apple, says Apple didn't respond truthfully to her claims. She asked the judge to make Apple be clearer and take away some of Apple's defenses. The judge decided that Apple should clarify some of its defenses but found Apple's current statements good enough for now. The judge also pointed out that Ashley needs to be careful when using artificial intelligence to help with her case, as it sometimes makes mistakes, and she's responsible for checking the facts.",

Ms. Gjovik differentiates between the two motions as \nfollows: the motion to strike is targeted at Apple’s affirmative defenses whereas the motion for a \nmore definite statement is directed to “Apple’s evasive denials” in its answer.  Docket No. 205 \n(Reply a t 8); see also  Docket No. 193 (Mot. at 1) (referring to “key denials that are evasive, vague, \nor implausible under the circumstances”).  Having considered the parties’ briefs and \naccompanying submissions, the Court hereby GRANTS in part and DENIES  in part  the motion to \nstrike and DENIES  the motion for a more definite statement.   The hearing on the motions is \nhereby VACATED . \nI. DISCUSSION  \nA. Motion for More Definite Statement  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure governs a motion for a more definite statement.  It \nprovides as follows:  \n \nA party may move for a more definite statement of a pleading to \nwhich a responsive pleading is allowed but which is so vague or \nambiguous that the party cannot reasonably prepare a response.  The Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 1 of 12 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  motion must be made before filing a responsive pleading and must \npoint out the defects complained of and the details desired.  If the \ncourt orders a more definite statement and the order is not obeyed \nwithin 14 days after notice of the order or within the time the court \nsets, the court may strike the pleading or issue any other appropriate \norder.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).  \nMs. Gjovik’s motion for a more definite statement is denied for several reasons.  First, the \nrule is inapplicable.  Rule 12(e) provides for the remedy of a more definite statement when the \nlitigant making the motion is required to file a “responsive pleading.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e).  Here, \nApple filed only an answer, and not any counterclaims.  Thus, Ms. Gjovik is not required to file a \nresponsive pleading.  See Thigpen v. Anderson , No. 1:24-cv-00214 -KWR -SCY , 2024 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 190346, at *14 (D.N.M. Oct. 18, 2024) (“A party may only move for a more definite \nstatement where responsive pleadings are allowed.  As discussed above, Defendant ’s Answer does \nnot raise counterclaims.”).  \nSecond, much of the relief sought by Ms. Gjovik is not a more definite statement but rather \nthe striking of denials made by Apple.  \nThird, the Court agrees with Apple that  much of the Rule 12(e) motion is directed at trying \nto resolve merits issues prior to discovery.   It is inapposite to the current situation.  \nFourth, “ Rule 12(e) motions are ordinarily restricted to situations where a pleading suffers \nfrom unintelligibility rather than want of detail. ”  Media.net Adver. FZ -LLC v. NetSeer, Inc. , 156 \nF. Supp. 3d 1052, 1075 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).   That is not the \nsituation here.  \nMs. Gjovik suggests that, at the very least, Apple should not be allowed to state in its \nanswer “no response is required” with respect to allegations related to dismissed claims .  Here, the \nCourt is not without some sympathy for Ms. Gjovik’s position .  For example , although the Court \ndismissed Ms. Gjovik’s environmental safety claims, it recognized that allegations related to those \nclaims could potentially  be relevant to her retaliation claims.   See Docket No. 204 (Order at 3) \n(noting that, “[a]lthough Ms. Gjovik will not have to prove that Apple actually violated an \nenvironmental safety law for [a] retaliation claim, she will still have to show that she reasonably \nbelieved there was such a violation” and, “[t]ypically, a reasonable belief has a factual basi s of Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 2 of 12 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  some kind”).   Nevertheless, as  a practical matter, the Court sees little value in having the parties \nbicker over which allegations in the fifth amended complaint are still relevant to the retaliation \nclaims and, if so, to what extent.  More important, it  can fairly be inferred from Apple’s answer \nthat it denies having engaged in any environmental safety violations.  See, e.g. , 5AC ¶ 229 (with \nrespect to § 1102.5 retaliation claim, alleging that “Apple discharged and discriminated against \nPlaintiff in retali ation for Plaintiff’s disclosure of information about Apple’s unlawful acts and \nomissions”); Ans. ¶ 229 (responding that, “[a]s to paragraph 229 of the Fifth Amended Complaint, \nApple denies the allegations”).   The Court, therefore, denies  Ms. Gjovik any relief with respect to \nher Rule 12(e) motion . \nB. Motion to Strike  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) provides that a “ court may strike from a pleading an \ninsufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. ”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12(f).   The bulk of Ms. Gjovik’s motion to strike is directed to A pple’s affirmative \ndefenses.   \n1. No. 1  \nIn the first affirmative defense, Apple claims a “fail[ure] to state facts sufficient to \nconstitute a cognizable claim for relief.”  Ms. Gjovik argues the defense should be stricken \nbecause it is not an affirmative defense .  See Zivokovic v. S. Cal. Edison Co. , 302 F.3d 1080, 1088 \n(9th Cir. 2022) (stating that “[a] defense which demonstrates that plaintiff has not met its burden \nof proof is not an affirmative defense ”) (emphasis added) .  She also notes that the Court has \nalready made rulings on several 12(b )(6) motions , allowing at least some  causes of action to \nproceed.  \nThe Court grants the motion to strike.  See Izett v. Crown Asset Mgmt., LLC , No. 18-cv-\n05224 -EMC , 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211459, at *4 -5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 14, 2018) (granting motion \nto strike defenses that were not “true” affirmative defenses, including failure to state a claim for \nrelief).  As a practical matter, however, the ruling has no real impact on the case because  Apple is \nnot precluded from asserting failure to state a claim for relief as a “regular” defense.  See also  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(h)(2) (provid ing that “[f]ailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted may Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 3 of 12 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  be raised: (A) in any pleading allowed or ordered under Rule 7(a); (B) by a motion under Rule \n12(c); or (C) at trial”).   To the extent the Court has already rejected arguments that Ms. Gjovik \nfailed to state a claim for relief for any cause of action, Apple may not relitigate the issue absent \nleave of the Court.  \n2. Nos. 6 and 7  \nThe sixth affirmative defense is “failure to exercise reasonable care and diligence to \nmitigate any damages allegedly accruing to [Ms. Gjovik].”  The seventh  affirmative defense  is \nsomewhat related: “Apple is entitled to an offset for any monies Plaintiff received from any source \nafter Plaintiff ceased to be employed by Apple under the doctrine prohibiting double recovery set \nforth by Witt v. Jackson , 57 Cal. 2d 57 (1961), and its progeny.”  Ms. Gjovik’s primary challenge \nto the affirmative defenses is that  Apple has not provided a factual basis in support .  See Izett , \n2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211459, at *2 (stating that “ courts in this District, including this Court, \nhave ‘consistently ’\" applied the Twombly  and Iqbal  standard to affirmative defenses ”; “‘a defense \nneed not include extensive factual allegations in order to give fair notice, [but] bare statements \nreciting mere legal conclusions may not be sufficient ’”).         \nThe Court grants the motion to strike.  To be sure, based on her briefs  alone , Ms. Gjovik \nclearly understands why Apple is asserting the defenses – e.g., Apple is suggesting that Ms. \nGjovik should have mitigated damages by seeking alternative employment and, if she did find \nalternative employment, that income should offset any damages , if awarded .1  While Apple \nsuggests that this satisfies the requirement of fair notice, it should still provide some concrete \nallegations along the lines of the above to support the defenses.   See id .   \nTo be clear, however, Apple’s  allegations need not be extensive.  Thus, e.g., Ms. Gjovik’s \nsuggestion that Apple must provide specifics such as an “actual job” that she turned down is not \ncorrect.  Docket No. 192 (Mot. at 8).  The Court also notes that Apple will have some leeway \nwhen conducting discovery into the defenses because  the information relevant to the defenses is , \n \n1 Apple’s decision to assert these defenses was likely informed by statements that Ms. Gjovik has \nmade during this litigation – e.g., that she has tried to find employment post -termination from \nApple and/or that she is unemployed.  Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 4 of 12 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  in large part, within the possession, custody, or control of Ms. Gjovik.  Accordingly, the motion to \nstrike is granted, but Apple has leave to amend.  \n3. No. 8  \nIn the eighth affirmative defense, Apple asserts: “Plaintiff’s recovery is barred in whole or \nin part by her own unclean hands and by the doctrines of unclean hands, in pari delicto  and/or \nafter-acquired evidence, or in the alternative, these doctrines cut off or reduce her alleged \ndamages.”  Ms. Gjovik’s primary argument is that Apple has failed to provide a factual basis for \nthe defense.     \nThe Court grants the motion to strike, but with leave to amend.  Similar to above, Ms. \nGjovik is likely aware of the factual predicate for the defenses – i.e., Apple’s position is that  she \nwas terminated because she disclosed, without authorization , confidential information and then \nfailed to participate in Apple’s  investigation of the matter.  Nevertheless, Apple should still \nprovide some concrete allegations along the lines of the above to support the defense, particularly \nbecause this information is , at least in part , within its possession, custody, or control.   See Izett, \n2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211459, at *2 . \n4. No. 12 \nIn the twelfth  affirmative defense, Apple states that “Plaintiff’s claims are barred in whole \nor in part by the applicable statutes of limitation, including Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 335.1, 338(a), \nand 340(a).”  According to Ms. Gjovik, the defense should be stricken beca use Apple has failed to \nplead a factual basis to support the defense.  She also argues that none of the specific statutes cited \nby Apple are applicable in her case.   \nThe Court denies the motion to strike.  Given that Ms. Gjovik worked for Apple from 2015 \nto 2021, see 5AC ¶ 12, and the sprawling nature of Ms. Gjovik’s operative complaint, see, e.g. , \n5AC ¶ 60 et seq.  (alleging harassment by managers in the department Ms. Gjovik worked in from \n2015 to 2017), it is fair for Apple to assert the defense to ensure that conduct outside of the \nrelevant limitations periods is not actionable.  Also, as Apple points out,  (1) § 335.1 applies to the \nclaim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, see Prue v. Brady Co./San Diego, \nInc., 242 Cal. App. 4th 1367, 1382 (2015); (2) § 338(a) applies to, inter alia , the § 1102.5 claim, Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 5 of 12 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  see Rabara v. Heartland Empl. Servs., LLC, o. 17 -CV-03770 -LHK , 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n71170, at *77 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 26, 2019)2; and (3) § 340(a) applies to the extent  a civil penalty is \nsought.   \n5. No. 15  \nIn the fifteenth affirmative defense, Apple asserts that this Court  \n \nlacks jurisdiction over any claim by Plaintiff for alleged mental, \nemotional and/or physical distress on the grounds that such claims \nare subject to the exclusive provisions of the California Workers’ \nCompensation laws.  See Cal. Labor Code § 3600, et seq.   \nAlternatively, Apple alleges that it may be entitled to a setoff for any \namounts paid to Plaintiff pursuant to the California Workers’ \nCompensation Act.  \nMs. Gjovik’s main contention is that the defense is legally invalid because “the exclusivity \ndoctrine of workers’ compensation does not apply to claims brought under California’s \nwhistleblower statutes, such as Labor Code § 1102.5.”  Docket No. 192 (Mot. at 14).  \nThe motion to strike is granted .  Apple has suggested that workers’ compensation \nexclusivity applies because Ms. Gjovik has asserted not just statutory claims but also a common \nlaw claim  for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.  But courts have held that a claim \nfor wrongful termination (as opposed to, e.g., intentional infliction of emotional distress) is not \nsubject to workers’ compensation exclusivity.  See Klip v. Marine Spill Response Corp. , No. C -11-\n06496 EDL , 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1602 6, at *6 -7 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 9, 2012) (“ The [California \nSupreme Court]  held that where the plaintiff alleged a Tameny  public policy claim as part of his \nclaim of IIED, only the underlying public policy claim may proceed and workers' compensation \nwas the exclusive remedy for the accompanying IIED .  A public policy violation as defined in \nTameny  . . . allows plaintiffs to proceed on public policy claims while remedies based on \naccompanying IIED claims remain exclusive to workers' compensation law. ”). \n \n2 In Newton v. Bank of Am erica , No. CV 16 -09581 -AB (RAOx) , 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 228955 \n(C.D. Cal. Jan. 18, 2018), the district court took note that there a lack of consensus (in both state \nand federal court) as to whether a three - or one -year statute of limitations applies for § 1102.5 \nclaims.  The court ultima tely concluded that there was a three -year statute of limitations where \ndamages were sought, although a one -year statute of limitations would apply if a civil penalty was \nsought.  See id.  at *16 -17. \n Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 6 of 12 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  As for Apple’s alternative position – i.e., any workers’ compensation could  still be used as \na set-off to damages, if awarded – the Court agrees with Ms. Gjovik that some concrete allegations \nare needed.  For example, is Apple aware of any workers’ compensation awarded to Ms. Gjovik \nduring the time she was employed with Apple?  \nThe motion to strike is therefore granted, but with leave to amend ( i.e., to the extent Apple \nasserts that workers’ compensation may be used as a set -off). \n6. No. 5  \nThe fifth affirmative defense is that “ Plaintiff consented to certain of the conduct that she \nnow claims was wrongful .” 3  Ms. Gjovik argues that the defense should be stricken because Apple \nhas failed to allege supporting facts for the defense.  \nThe motion to strike is denied.  In its answer, Apple alleged that Mr. Gjovik signed a \nconsent with respect to use of the Gobbler application.  See Ans. ¶ 218.  Though this allegation \nwas not made directly in conjunction with the fifth affirmative defense per se, the allegation still \nestablishes a factual basis for the defense.  \n7. Nos. 4, 11, 14  \nIn the following affirmative defenses, Apple asserts  as follows : \n• No. 4: “Plaintiff was an at -will employee with no entitlement to continued \nemployment pursuant to Labor Code section 2922.”  \n• No. 9 : “[A]ssuming arguendo  that discriminatory or retaliatory reasons had been a \nmotivating factor in any employment decision toward Plaintiff (which they were \nnot), Apple would have made the same decisions toward Plaintiff in any case for \nlegitimate, non -discriminatory and/or nonr etaliatory business reasons.”   \n• No. 10 : “[A]ny alleged action that [Apple] took with respect to Plaintiff was \nprivileged and justified and protected by the doctrine of business necessity.”  \n• No. 11: “[Apple] at all times acted without malice, in good faith, and with \nreasonable grounds for believing its actions did not violate the law.”  \n \n3 Contrary to what Ms. Gjovik asserts, Apple has not included waiver , estoppel, or laches as part \nof the fifth or any other affirmative defense.  Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 7 of 12 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  • No. 14: “[Apple] was fully justified, and exercised reasonable care, prudence, skill \nand business judgment with respect to Plaintiff, and any decisions with respect to \nPlaintiff were made without regard to Plaintiff’s alleged disability, national origin, \nage or other protected basis.”  \nMs. Gjovik moves to strike the defenses as legally untenable and/or factually unsupported.  \nThe motion to strike is granted, but with leave to amend.  The Court does not agree that the \ndefenses are legally untenable.  As Apple explains in its opposition, it is simply contending that it \ndid not act unlawfully and that it had a legitimate basis to terminate Ms. Gjovik.  The Court strikes \nthe defense s only because Apple has not provided  concrete facts to support the defenses.  In its \nopposition, Apple already indicates what those facts will be ( i.e., it terminated Ms. Gjovik for \ndisclosing, without a uthorization, confidential information and for not participating in Apple’s \ninvestigation into the matter), but those facts should still be articulated in the pleading.   \nTo the extent Ms. Gjovik suggests that all or some of the  defenses are not “true” \naffirmative defenses, that is unclear .  Context may inform whether  the defenses are affirmative \ndefenses or instead are defenses related to elements that Ms. Gjovik has the burden of proving as \npart of her prima facie case.  Thus, the Court does not strike on that basis.  \n8. Nos. 2 -3 \nAffirmative Defenses Nos. 2 and 3 relate to causation.  Apple asserts that “no conduct by \nor attributable to it was the cause in fact or legal cause of the damages, if any, suffered by \nPlaintiff,” and “[s]hould it be determined that Plaintiff was damaged, then said damages were \nproximately caused by Plaintiff’s own conduct.”   In her motion, Ms. Gjovik argues that the \ndefenses should be stricken because Apple has failed to provide a factual basis for the defense.   \nThe Court grants the motion to strike, but with leave to amend.  Admittedly, Ms. Gjovik is \naware of Apple’s position that she was terminated because she disclosed, without authorization \nconfidential information and failed to participate in the investigation of the matter.  Nevertheless, \nApple should still provide some concrete alle gations  to that effect to support the defense.  \n9. No. 16  \nThe sixteenth affirmative defense is as follows: “Apple reserves the right to assert Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 8 of 12 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  additional defenses in the event discovery indicates it would be appropriate to do so.”  Ms. Gjovik \nargues the Court should strike the defense as it is not a defense at all.  \nThe Court grants the motion.  “‘The mere reservation of affirmative defenses is not an \naffirmative defense.’”  Izett, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 211459, at *5.  However, if Apple finds, \nwhether through discovery or otherwise, a basis for additional affirmative defenses, it may move \nfor leave to amend its answer in accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15.  See id.  \n10.  No. 13  \nIn the thirteenth affirmative defense, Apple states: “[A]ny award of punitive damages in \nthis case would violate the due process, equal protection and excessive fines provisions of the \nCalifornia and United States Constitutions. ”  According to Ms. Gjovik, the defense should be \nstricken because it is boilerplate in nature.  \nThe motion to strike is denied.  To be sure,  without knowing what punitive damages are \nawarded (if any), the Court cannot assess whether the amount is excessive or violates due process \n(e.g., because of the magnitude compared to the actual damages).  However, the Court shall not \nstrike the defense because  Ms. Gjovik’s prior pleadings have indicated that she will be seeking \nsignificant punitive damages.  See, e.g. , Docket No. 32 -2 (SAC ¶¶ 1603 -08) (suggesting that \npunitive damages should be at least 10 times  the compensatory award and should take into account \nApple’s market cap of over $3 trillion).  \n11. Relief Sought of Dismissal and Attorneys’ Fees  \nIn its prayer for relief, Apple asks, inter alia , for a dismissal of Ms. Gjovik’s complaint \nand an award of attorneys’ fees.  Ms. Gjovik asserts that this specific relief  should be stricken.  \nThe motion to strike is denied.  If Apple prevails in this suit, it is entitled to a dismissal \neven if it has not brought any counterclaims.  As for attorneys’ fees, the issue is premature but the \nCourt cannot say at this juncture that a request for fees i s improper in light of, e.g., Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 11.  \n12. References to No “Preclusive Effect”  \nApple’s answer contains statements that government agency determinations do not have \npreclusive effect.  See, e.g. , Ans. ¶ 8.  Ms. Gjovik moves to strike such statements because they Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 9 of 12 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  are irrelevant: “Plaintiff never alleged that the government’s actions, such as investigations or \nenforcement, have any preclusive effect on the claims at issue here.  Instead, Plaintiff has simply \nreferenced the government’s actions in relation to the rep orted violations and retaliation.”  Docket \nNo. 192 (Mot. at 7).  \nThe motion to strike  is denied .  “The standard for striking portions of a complaint under \nRule 12(f) ‘is strict and . . . only allegations that are so unrelated to the plaintiffs' claims as to be \nunworthy of any consideration should be stricken.’”  Sizer v. Bennett , No. 2:17 -cv-01591 -LPL, \n2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 118773, at *3 -4 (W.D. Pa. July 17, 2018).   Moreover, although Ms. \nGjovik’s motion states that she does not seek to hold Apple to any agency determination, her reply \nis not consistent.  See Docket No. 206 (Reply at 2, 4) (arguing that Apple’s answer is, “in some \ncases, in direct contradiction to agency findings and public settlements” – e.g., “Apple has inserted \ndefenses . . . that directly conflict with its admissions and compliance obligations in prior federal \nagency settlements”).  \nC. RJN \nIn conjunction with the pending motions, Ms. Gjovik has filed a request for judicial notice.  \nSpecifically, Ms. Gjovik  has asked the Court to take judicial notice of certain NLRB settlement \nproceedings.  The request for judicial notice is denied.  As indicated by the above , the settlement \nproceedings are largely irrelevant  to resolution of the pending motions .  Moreover, Ms. Gjovik’s \nrequest  improperly asks the Court to do  more than just take judicial notice of any facts.   Finally, \nMs. Gjovik ignores that the settlement agreement contains a non -admissions clause.  See Docket \nNo. 194 (ECF Page 16) (Settlement Agreement) (“By entering into this Agreement the Charged \nParty does not admit to any violation of the National Labor Relations Act.”).  \nD. Use of Artificial Intelligence  \nFinally, the Court addresses Apple’s arguments related to Ms. Gjovik’s use of artificial \nintelligence (“AI”)  and its request for sanctions  pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  11.  \nMs. Gjovik has admitted to use of AI.  See, e.g. , Docket No. 206 (Reply at 10).  Apple argues that \nher use of AI has been , and continues to be , a problem  because she has not confirmed , and \ncontinues not to confirm , the accuracy of the AI-generated information or information otherwise Case 3:23-cv-04597-EMC     Document 215     Filed 05/19/25     Page 10 of 12 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  provided by AI .  Apple has pointed to a number of examples where the information provided is \nnot correct, indicating that Ms. Gjovik has not been verifying  the information.4  Ms. Gjovik \nmaintains that she is exercising oversight , but the examples provided by Apple indicate otherwise .  \nNotably, Ms. Gjovik does not address the numerous examples provided by Apple.  She simply \nstates that she is making a “good faith effort, as time and resources allow, to review, verify, and \nedit all content.”  Docket No. 206 (Reply at 10).   \nAt this juncture, the Court shall not impose any sanctions.  However, it forewarns Ms. \nGjovik that (1) she is responsible for verifying the accuracy of AI-generated or AI -provided \ninformation , including but not limited to case citations and content , and that (2) failure to do so \nmay lead to sanctions, including but not limited to a finding of contempt and/or the ability to \nproceed pro se.  See Kruglyak , 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56784, at *10 (declining to sanction pro se \nplaintiff for use of AI but, “going forward,” plaintiff was ordered to “identify any cases that are \nthe result of legal research preformed with generative AI” and held “responsible for verifying their \naccuracy”; also cautioning  plaintiff that failure to do so could lead him to be held in contempt of \ncourt and to lose the ability to proceed pro se) . \nMs. Gjovik is also advised that the standard applicable to her conduct is Rule 11.  Cf. Park \nv. Kim , 91 F.4th 610, 616 (2d Cir. 2024) (stating that, “[i]f a lawyer chooses to employ technology \nin representing a client, the lawyer continues to be bound by the requirements of Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 11”) .  See, e.g. , Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2) (“ By presenting to the court a pleading, \nwritten motion, or other paper [, . . .] an attorney or unrepresented party certifies that to the best of \nthe person's kno wledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the \ncircumstances:  . . . (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing \nlaw . . . .”).  The Court is cognizant that Ms. Gjovik is involved in other proceedings against Apple \n \n4 See generally  Williams v. Cap. One Bank, N.A. , No.: 24 -2032 (RC) , 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n49256, at *20 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025) (noting that “[c]ourts have recently seen increasing reliance \non artificial intelligence in legal proceedings, leading to the use of nonexistent citations in court \ndocuments”); Kruglyak v. Home D epot U.S.A., Inc., 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 56784, at *4 (W.D. \nVal. Mar. 25, 2025) (stating that AI “platforms sometimes ‘hallucinate,’ meaning they provide \ninaccurate responses[;] [i]n the legal research context, these hallucinations can include the \ngenerati on of fictitious case cites and misrepresentations of case summaries or holdings”).

That fact, \nhowever, does not relieve her of her Rule 11 obligations before this Court.  \nThe Court emphasizes that it is Ms. Gjovik’s responsibility to confirm the accuracy of \ninformation  before  she files any papers with the Court  containing that information ; the burden is \nnot on Apple to identify what information is problematic.  That being said, if Apple seeks Rule 11 \nsanctions in the future  based on filings made by Ms. Gjovik , then it must comply with the rule’s \nprocedures, including the safe harbor.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c).  \nII. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Ms. Gjovik’s motion for a more definite statement is denied, but \nthe motion to strike is granted in part and denied in part.  Apple may file an amended answer \nconsistent with the Court’s rulings above.  The amended answer shall b e filed within two weeks of \nthe date of this order.  \nThis order disposes of Docket No s. 192-93. \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \n \nDated:  May 19, 2025  \n \n______________ ________________________  \nEDWARD M.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The court dismissed Sidney David Dopp's lawsuit as frivolous, as it was based on unfounded claims involving alleged psychological and physical harm caused by an implanted chip and the use of AI and radio frequencies. The court also denied his request to proceed without prepaying court fees due to the frivolous nature of the case.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the plaintiff's claims, based on alleged harm from implanted technology and AI, present a legally viable basis for a lawsuit.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that the claims were frivolous, as they lacked any factual or legal basis, and dismissed the case without prejudice. The court also found the associated application to proceed without paying fees to be moot.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation: Imagine someone goes to court claiming the government secretly put a chip in their head that makes them hear voices and do strange things with the help of advanced computers. The court listened to the story and decided it was too outlandish and didn't fit with any known laws, so they said, \"Sorry, this doesn't count as a real case,\" and didn't charge him any court fees because the case didn't have any real footing.",

 and (2) Application  to Proceed in District Court Without Prepaying  Fees \nor Costs, ECF No. 2 (“IFP Application”).   For the following  reasons, the Court dismisses  \nthis action as frivolous  and denies the IFP Application  as moot. \nThe Court received the Statement  on December  13, 2013.  See Docket.  The \nStatement  lacks a usual civil‐action complaint’s  form, and has no caption listing specific \ndefendants.   See, e.g., Statement  1.  But the Civil Cover Sheet that Dopp submitted  with \nthe Statement  indicates  that he seeks to name as Defendants  here Christopher  A. Wray \n(the current director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation)  as well as up to 50 CASE 0:23-cv-03804-PJS-DJF   Doc. 7   Filed 01/04/24   Page 1 of 42 unidentified  “Jane [and] John Does.”  See ECF No. 1‐2 at 1.  Dopp proceeds  here pro se, \nand courts are to construe  pro se filings liberally.   See, e.g., Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, \n94 (2007).  The Court therefore  construes  the Statement  as an attempt to file a case‐\ninitiating  pleading  that targets Wray and various unidentified  Does as defendants.  \nThe Statement,  however,  contains no specific discussion  of Wray or any of these \nunidentified  Does.  See Statement  1.  One page long, the Statement  suggests  that ever \nsince Dopp underwent  a medical procedure  in April 2016, he has started hearing voices \nand suffered effects including  “brain washing  and mind control.”   Id.  As the Court \nunderstands  the Statement,  Dopp contends  that unidentified  individuals  placed a \n“chip” of some sort inside him, causing him various sorts of psychological  and physical \nharm.  Id.1 \nAlongside  the Statement,  Dopp submitted  the IFP Application.   Under the \nfederal statute governing  in forma pauperis (“IFP”) proceedings,  “[n]otwithstanding  any \nfiling fee, or any portion thereof, that may have been paid, the court shall dismiss [a \nmatter proceeding  IFP] at any time if the court determines  that . . . the action . . . is \n \n1 Since filing the Statement  and IFP Application,  Dopp has sent the Court four CDs \nostensibly  containing  materials  supporting  his claims.  See ECF Nos. 3, 4 (comprising  \nplaceholders  for submitted  CDs).  To the extent that Dopp suggests  that the Court \nshould scour these materials  to independently  develop allegations  or causes of action \nthat might support this action, the Court respectfully  declines the invitation.   The task \nof crafting an opening pleading  rests with a plaintiff,  not the Court, so the Court will \nnot look through these materials  to see how they might possibly support Dopp’s claims.  \nSee, e.g., Frelix v. Hendrie Grant Lending Inc., No. 23‐CV‐0896 (DWF/TNL),  2023 WL \n3571906, at *3 n.4 (D. Minn. May 18, 2023) (citing cases). CASE 0:23-cv-03804-PJS-DJF   Doc. 7   Filed 01/04/24   Page 2 of 43 frivolous  . . . .”  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2).   A case is frivolous  when “‘it lacks an arguable  \nbasis either in law or in fact.’”  Denton v. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 31 (1992) (quoting  \nNeitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989)). \nThe action that the Statement  contemplates  is frivolous  for at least two reasons.  \nFirst, courts in this District routinely  dismiss, as factually  frivolous,  claims against \ndefendants  when the relevant opening pleading  has no factual allegations  about those \ndefendants.   See, e.g., Johnson v. Reed, No. 23‐CV‐2130 (PJS/DTS),  2023 WL 7388389, at *4 \n(D. Minn. Nov. 8, 2023) (citing caselaw);

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, plaintiff Jordan Stein filed a putative class action against Clarifai, Inc., alleging unauthorized use of her photographs from OKCupid for developing facial recognition technology, thus violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) and claims of unjust enrichment. The court dismissed the case due to lack of personal jurisdiction over Clarifai in Illinois, as the company's minimal connections to the state were insufficient to establish such jurisdiction. AI is central to the case as Clarifai used AI technologies to extract and utilize biometric information from photos for facial recognition purposes.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Illinois court has personal jurisdiction over Clarifai, Inc. based on the company's alleged unauthorized use of biometric information from residents of Illinois in developing facial recognition technology.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it does not have personal jurisdiction over Clarifai, Inc. because the company's contacts with Illinois (such as sales of its demographic model to a small number of Illinois customers) were not sufficient to establish minimum contacts required for jurisdiction, leading to the dismissal of the complaint without prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone takes your picture from a social app without asking and uses it to teach computers to recognize faces. You want to sue the company doing this, but the court says you can't sue them here because they don't do enough business in your state to be brought to court there. This case got dropped because the company wasn't connected enough to your state, even though they took your picture without asking.",

Ellis   \nCLARIFAI, INC.,  ) \n )   \nDefendant.  ) \n \nOPINION AND ORDER \nAfter learning that Defendant Clarifai, Inc. (“Clarifai ”), a technology company based in \nNew York , collected photographs from her OKCupid profile and used her facial information for \nprofit without her consent, Plaintiff Jordan Stein filed this putative class action against Clarifai.  \nStein alleges that Clarifai violated  §§ 15(a), (b), and (c) of the Illinois Biometric Information \nPrivacy Act (“BIPA”) , 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/1 et seq.  She also brings a claim for unjust \nenrichment.  Clarifai now moves the Court to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2)  or, in the alternative, for failure to \nstate a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  Bec ause Stein has not alleged sufficient contacts to show \nClarifai directly targeted Illinois , the Court does not have jurisdiction over it  and so dismisses \nStein’s complaint without prejudice .   \nBACKGROUND\n1 \n Clarifai , a technology company  incorporated in Delaware and  based in New York , \nspecializ es in artificial intelligence.  It created a face database (the “database”) to develop and \n                                                 \n1 In addressing Clarifai’s  motion to dismiss, the Court is not limited to the pleadings. See Purdue \nResearch Found. v. Sanofi -Synthelabo, S.A., 338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. 2003).  Therefore, the Court Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 1 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n train algorithms used in its facial recognition technology .  In doing so, Clarifai created thousands \nof uni que face templates by scanning biometric information contained in photographs housed in \nthe database and extracting the unique geometry of each face detected therein.  Clarifai also \nprovides pre -trained visual recognition models, including a demographic model, that can \nrecognize certain attributes in an image.  Since May 2018, Clarifai may have  sold fifty -eight \ndemographic models to two customers located in Illinois.  These sales brought in approximately seven cents in revenue, as Clarifai  bills its  custome rs at a rate of $1.20 per $1,000 operations.  \nOn July 13, 2019, the New York Time s published an article that revealed that Clarifai \nbuilt the database from  OKCupid profile pictures.  The article further revealed that Clarifai \nsigned an agreement with a larg e social media company to use its users’ images for training \nfacial recognition algorithms.  According to OKCupid, Clarifai contacted it  in 2014 in hopes of \ncollaborating on artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology.  Clarifai gained access  \nto OKCupid users ’ profile photographs from one of its investors, Corazon, a Chicago -based \nventure capital fund, and its principals, Sam Yagan and Max Krohn, who  founded OKCupid.  \nKrohn used his personal email account to provide the photographs  to Clarifai’s chief executive \nofficer, Matthew Zeiler .\n2   \n                                                 \ndraws  the facts from the complaint  and the additional documents  submitted by the parties.  The Court \nresolves all factual conflicts and draws all reasonable inferences in Stein’s  favor.  Id. at 782– 83. \n \n2 The parties filed their briefs and exhibits under seal , also providing redacted versions .  If the Court \nrefers to a sealed document,  it attempts to do so without revealing any information that could be \nreasonably deemed confidential.  Nonetheless, if the Court discusses confidential information, it has done \nso because it is necessary to explain the path of its reasoning.  See In re Spe cht, 622 F.3d 697, 701 (7th \nCir. 2010) (“Documents that affect the disposition of federal litigation are presumptively open to public \nview, even if the litigants strongly prefer secrecy, unless a statute, rule, or privilege justifies \nconfidentiality.”); Un ion Oil Co. of Cal. v. Leavell , 220 F.3d 562, 568 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that a \njudge ’s “opinions and orders belong in the public domain”).  Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n In 2013, Stein, an Illinois resident, signed up for an account on OKCupid and uploaded \nroughly five digital photographs of herself to create her user profile; to date, Stein still uses the \napplication.  Because Stein’s account was active at the time Clarifai obtained profile photographs to create its database, Clarifai has used Stein ’s profile photographs in its  database.  At no time \ndid Clarifai inform Stein of the use of her photographs to collect, ca pture, receive, store, or use \nher facial information.  Instead, Stein learned that Clarif ai had gained access to her OKCupid \nprofile photographs from  the New York Times profile of Clarifai .   \nClarifai asserts it has never developed a business relationship with OKCupid and has no \nknowledge of where OKCupid users are located.  Zeiler states that Clarifai operates a globally \naccessible website, and while the website is accessible in Illinois, Clarifai does not target its \nwebsite to residents in Illinois .  Clar ifai is not registered to do business in Illinois, has no offices \nor employees in Illinois, has never had property, employees or operations in Illinois, and does not maintain a place of business in Illinois.  Zeiler indicates that Clarifai does not target its \nmarketing, sales, or commercial activity towards Illinois, nor does it specifically develop or train facial recognition or artificial technology in Illinois.    \nLEGAL STANDARD  \n A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) challenges the Court’s jurisdiction over a party.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  When a defendant raises a Rule 12(b)(2) challenge, “the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating the existence of jurisdiction.”  Curry  v. Revolution Labs., LLC , 949 \nF.3d 385, 392 (7th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted).  If the Court rules on the Rule 12(b)(2) motion without an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction.  Id . at 392–93; N . Grain Mktg., LLC v. Greving, 743 F.3d 487, 491 (7th Cir. 2014).  \nIn resolving a Rule 12(b)(2) motion, the Court “accept[s] as true all well -pleaded facts alleged in Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n the complaint,” Felland v. Clifton , 682 F.3d 665, 672 (7th Cir. 2012), and “reads the complaint \nliberally with every inference drawn in favor of [the] plaintiff,” GCIU -Emp. Ret. Fund v. \nGoldfarb Corp., 565 F.3d 1018, 1020 n.1 (7th Cir. 2009).  However, if the defendant submits \n“evidence opposing the district court’s exercise of personal juris diction, the plaintiff must \nsimilarly submit affirmative evidence supporting the court’s exercise of jurisdiction.”  Matlin v. Spin Master Corp., 921 F.3d 701, 705 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Court “accept[s] as true any facts contained in the defendant’s affida vits that remain unrefuted by the plaintiff,” GCIU -Emp. Ret. \nFund, 565 F.3d at 1020 n.1, but resolves “any factual disputes in the [parties’] affidavits in favor of the plaintiff,” Felland, 682 F.3d at 672.   \nANALYSIS  \n Clarifai moves to dismiss Stein’s cla ims against it for four reasons: first, that the \ncomplaint lacks allegations sufficient to assert personal jurisdiction over it under Rule 12(b)( 2); \nsecond, if personal jurisdiction does exist , that BIPA does not have extraterritorial application; \nthird, t hat applying BIPA to Clarifai violates the Dormant Commerce Clause ; and finally, that \nStein’s unjust enrichment claim is duplicative  of the BIPA claims .  The Court need only address \nClarifai’s personal jurisdiction argument, as it is dispositive.   \n In diversity cases, the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant only if \npersonal jurisdiction would be proper in an Illinois court.  Hyatt Int’l Corp. v. Coco, 302 F.3d 707, 713 (7th Cir. 2002).  Illinois allows for personal jurisdiction to the full extent authorized by the Illinois and United States Constitutions.  KM Enters., Inc. v. Glob. Traffic Techs., Inc., 725 F.3d 718, 732 (7th Cir. 2013).  Although there may be theoretical differences between the federal and Illinois constitutiona l standards, the Seventh Circuit has observed that “no Illinois case has \nprovided a definitive explanation” of these differences.  Matlin , 921 F.3d at  705.  Moreover, both Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n constitutional standards essentially focus on whether exercising jurisdiction over a  defendant is \nfair and reasonable.  See  KM Enters. , 725 F.3d at 732.  Thus, a single inquiry into whether the \nUnited States Constitution permits jurisdiction suffices.  See, e.g., Curry , 949 F.3d at  393; \nIllinois v. Hemi Grp. LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 756–57 (7th Cir. 2010); see also Wesly  v. Nat’l  \nHemophilia Found., 2020 IL App (3d) 170569, ¶  16 (“ [I]t is generally true that, when federal due \nprocess concerns regarding personal jurisdiction are satisfied, so are Illinois due process \nconcerns.” (alteration in orig inal) (citation omitted)).  Jurisdiction is proper under the Due \nProcess Clause of the United States Constitution if the defendant has “certain minimum contacts \nwith [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting Millikin v. Meyer , 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)).  Minimum contacts exist where “the \ndefendant’s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.”  World -Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. \n286, 297 (1980); Brook v. McCormley , 873 F.3d 549, 552 (7th Cir. 2017) . \nPersonal jurisdiction comes in two forms: general and specific .  uBI D, Inc. v. GoDaddy \nGrp., Inc., 623 F.3d 421, 425 (7th Cir. 2010) .  Stein  does not contend that this Court has general \njurisdiction over Clarifa i so the Court limits its analysis accordingly .  See  Doc. 52 at 5.  Specific \njurisdiction exists “when the defendant purposefully directs its activities at the forum state and the alleged injury arises out of those activities.”  Mobile Anesthesiologists Chicago, LLC v. \nAnesthesia Assocs. of Houston Metroplex, P.A., 623 F.3d 440, 444 (7th Cir. 2010).  The Court looks to the “defendant’s suit -related conduct” and its connection to the forum state; “a \ndefendant’s relationship with a plaintiff or third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.”  Walden v . Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 283, 286 (2014); Philos Techs., Inc. v. Philos & D, Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n Inc., 802 F.3d 905, 915– 16 (7th Cir. 2015).  The Court considers “whether the conduct \nunderlying the claims was purposely directed at the forum state,” looking at whether Clarifai  \nengaged in “(1)  intentional conduct (or ‘intentional and allegedly tortious’ conduct); \n(2) expressly aimed at the forum state; (3) with the defendant’s knowledge that the effects would \nbe felt —that is, the plaintiff would be injured—in the forum state.”  Ta mburo  v. Dworkin , 601 \nF.3d 693, 702–03 (7th Cir. 2010) . \nStein argues that Clarifai has sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois because it \nobtained the profile photos from an Illinois -based company and it has market ed and s old the  \ndemographic model  to Illinois customers .  Clarifai  contends, however, that  while it has sold its \nproduct to a small number of Illinois customers, it merely runs an interactive website  that does \nnot specifically target Illinois residents  and has no other relevant ties to this state .  Instead, \naccording to Clarifai, the only connection to Illinois is the fact that Stein resides here.     \nHere, Stein alleges that  Clarifai committed a tortious act in Illinois by illegally obtaining \nimages of her and other Illinois OKCupid users  and subsequently us ing those photographs to \ntrain its facial recognition software in violation of BIPA.  The only alleged tie t o Illinois with \nrespect to Clarifai’s acquisition of the photographs is through Corazon, a Chicago- based venture \ncapital fund, and its principals, two of whom, Sam Yagan and Max Krohn, also founded OKCupid.  As jurisdictional discovery revealed, Zeiler, Cl arifai’s CEO, reached out to Krohn to \ninquire whether Clarifai could obtain access to OKCupid’s data, and eventually, Krohn provided this information to Zeiler from his personal email account.  Stein has not provided any basis to infer  that Krohn took this  action on behalf of Corazon or that Krohn otherwise has a connection \nto Illinois.\n3  And while Corazon invested in Clarifai, this relationship does not subject Clarifai to \n                                                 \n3 In fact, Clarifai states in its reply that Krohn is a resident of New York or New Jersey.  Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n jurisdiction in Illinois with respect to the claims at issue here; Clarifai’s contact s with Illinois \nmust come from its suit -related activity in the forum state, not from the activity of a third party , \nand so its  contractual relationship with Corazon, which does not appear to have any bearing on \nthe claims at issue here, is irrelevant to the specific jurisdiction analysis in this case .  See \nSalkauskaite v. Sephora USA, Inc., No. 18 -CV-08507, 2020 WL 2796122, at *4 (N.D. Ill. May \n30, 2020)  (a defendant’s “contacts also must come from the activity of the defendant, not from \nthe activity of the plaintiff or a third party ”); see also Purdue , 338 F.3d 773, 780 (7th Cir. 2003)  \n(“[I]t must be the activity of the defendant that makes it amenable to jurisdiction, not the \nunilateral activity of the plaintiff or some other entity. ” (citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , \n471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985)) ).  Further, Stein has not rebutted Clarifai ’s representation that it does \nnot develop or train facial or artificial technology in Illinois  and has no knowledge of where the \nOKCupid users whose in formation it used reside .  See Gullen v. Facebook.com, Inc., No. 15 C \n7681, 2016 WL 245910, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 21, 2016)  (“Plaintiff alleges that Facebook uses \nfacial recognition technology on ‘ every user -uploaded photo,’  not just on photos uploaded in or \nby residents of Illinois .  Given this tacit admission that Facebook ’s alleged collection of \nbiometric information is not ta rgeted at Illinois residents, the [] ‘ contact ’ becomes simply that \nFacebook operates an interactive website available to Illinois residents. ” (citation omitted)).  \nTherefore, t he Court cannot find that Clarifai specifically targeted Illinois  in connection with its \nacquisition of OKCupid Illinois residents’ user profiles.    \nStein also argues  that Clarifai ’s sales of its demographic model  to two Illinois customers \ncreates the required minimum contacts with Illinois .  These two customers purchased access  to \nthe model  as many as fifty -eight  times  in the eighteen months before Stein filed suit , generating \napproximately  seven cents in revenue  for Clarifai .  Clarifai maintains that these purchases do not Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n show that Clarifai targeted its products, including the database, to Illinois customers and instead \nonly reflects that it operated an interactive website, which does not suffice to create jurisdiction in thi s state.   It also represents that it “does not target its marketing, sales, commercial activity, or \ndeploy its technology towards Illinois.”  Doc. 21 -1 ¶ 8.    \nThe Seventh Circuit has c autioned that courts “should be careful in resolving questions \nabout pe rsonal jurisdiction involving online contacts to ensure that a defendant is not haled into \ncourt simply because the defendant owns or operates a website that is accessible in the forum state.”  Hemi , 622 F.3d at 760; see also be2 LLC v. Ivanov , 642 F.3d 555, 558 (7th Cir. 2011) \n(“Beyond simply operating an interactive website that is accessible from the forum state, a defendant must in some way target the forum state ’s market.  If the defendant merely operates a \nwebsite, even a ‘highly interactive’ website,  that is accessible from, but does not target, the \nforum state, then the defendant may not be haled into court in that state without offending the Constitution.” (citations omitted) ).  Certainly , evidence of extensive sales from an interactive \nwebsite may  show that Clarifai has targeted Illinois so as to subject it to this Court’s jurisdiction .  \nSee Curry, 949 F.3d at 399 (7th Cir. 2020)  (court had j urisdiction  over  defendant who made sales \nto 767 customers  in the state  through multiple interactive websites).  But such evidence does not \nexist here.  While Stein relies on Hemi  in her personal jurisdiction argument, the facts of that \ncase make it distinguishable.  As opposed to the small amount of sales to two customers here, the defendant in Hemi  made an affirmative choice to allow sales in Illinois  by selling 300 packs of \ncigarettes, a heavily regulated product, to one Illinois resident while deliberately choosing not to sell cigarettes to residents of other states.  Hemi , 622 F.3d at 760.  Likewise in  Mutnick v. \nClearview AI, Inc. , not only did Clearview sell  biometric information to Illinois entiti es but it \nalso marketed its  user accounts  for its facial recognition database to the Illinois Secretary of State Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n and negotiated a contract with the Secretary of State.  No. 20- cv-0846, 2020 WL 4676667, at *2 \n(N.D.  Ill. Aug. 12, 2020) .  Stein has not presented any similar evidence.  Thus, the  miniscule \nnumber of transactions  at issue here, fifty -eight  sales to just two Illinois residents  that garnered \nClarifai only seven cents in revenue , without additional evidence  to show Clarifai targeted the \nforum state  cannot suffice  to subject Clarifai to  personal jurisdiction in this Court .  See Matlin , \n921 F.3d at 707 ( a single sale of a product without more evidence is not enough to assert \npersonal jurisdiction) ; Advanced Tactical  Ordnance Ss., LLC v. Real Action Paintball, Inc., 751 \nF.3d 796, 801 (7th Cir. 2014)  (“[I]t is unlikely that those few sales alone, w ithout some evidence \nlinking them to the allegedly tortious activity, would make jurisdiction proper.  To hold \notherwise would mean that a plaintiff could bring suit in literally any state where the defendant shipped at least one item.”  (citation omitted) ); be2, 642 F.3d at  559 (e vidence that twenty  Illinois \nresidents had opened accounts on the defendant’s interactive website . a “miniscule number of \nregistrants,”  did not create specific jurisdiction over the defendant, particularly where no \nevidence existed  that the defendant had targeted the state).   Because Stein has not demonstrated \nthat Clarifai  directed its suit- related actions at Illinois  so as to subject it to this Court’s \njurisdiction , even after engaging in jurisdictional discovery, the Court must dismiss her \ncomplaint for lack of jurisdiction .\n4   \n  \n                                                 \n4 Because the Court  concludes that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Clarifai, it does not address \nClarifai’s alternative arguments for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court grants Clarifai’s  motion to dismiss [ 20].  The \nCourt dismisses Stein’s claims without prejudice for lack of personal jurisdiction and terminates \nthis case.  \n \nDated: March 16, 2021  ______________________ \n SARA L.

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nIn this employment discrimination case, Terry Terell Goins, proceeding pro se, alleged that Father Flanagan's Boys' Home discriminated against him based on sex and retaliated against him for filing discrimination charges. The court dismissed the case due to Goins' failure to establish a factual basis for the claims according to the legal standard, untimely filings, and a lack of evidence showing discriminatory bias. AI was indirectly involved as the defendant suspected Goins used generative AI to produce inaccurate citations in his brief.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nWhether Goins’ complaint sufficiently stated a claim of employment discrimination and retaliation under federal law.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court held that Goins had not stated a claim upon which relief could be granted under federal employment law, leading to the dismissal of his complaint. His claims were either factually unsupported, procedurally barred, or lacked evidence of discriminatory intent.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation:\nImagine someone named Terry feels they were treated unfairly at work and fired because of their gender. They tried to sue their former employer but did not provide enough convincing details or follow the necessary steps to show how or why they were mistreated. Moreover, they used a computer program to help create their legal argument, which accidentally referenced some made-up or incorrect information. Because of all this, the judge decided that Terry's case could not proceed in court.",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA  \n \nTERRY TERELL GOINS , \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nvs.  \n FATHER FLANAGAN'S BOYS' \nHOME,  \n \nDefendant.   \n \n \n8:23- CV-477 \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER  \n \n  \n \n This is an employment discrimination case. See filing 20 at 1. The  pro se \nplaintiff, Terry Ter ell Goins, alleges the defendant, Father Flanagan's Boys' \nHome , discriminated and retaliated against him on the basis of  his sex. See \nfiling 20 at 9 . This matter is before the Court on the defendant's motion to \ndismiss ( filing 16 ), the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended \ncomplaint ( filing 21 ), and the defendant's motion to strike ( filing 25 ) one of the  \nplaintiff's brief s (filing 22). This case will be dismissed.  \nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nA complaint must set forth a short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). This \nstandard does not require detailed factual allegations, but it demands more \nthan an unadorned accusation. Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) . The \ncomplaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, but must provide more \nthan labels and conclusions; and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not suffice. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 \n(2007) . For the purposes of a motion to dismiss the Court must take all of the 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 1 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>2 \n factual allegations in the complaint as true, but is not bound to accept as true \na legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation. Id. \nAnd to survive a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) , a \ncomplaint must also contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face. Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. The Court \nwill liberally construe pro se  complaints, and these litigants are held to a lesser \npleading standard. Topchian v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. , 760 F.3d 843, \n849 (8th Cir. 2014) . If the essence of an allegation is discernible, although \npleaded without \"legal nicety,\" the Court will construe the complaint in a way that allows the claim to be evaluated within the proper legal framework. Stone \nv. Harry , 364 F.3d 912, 915 (8th Cir. 2004) . While the Court must accept as \ntrue all facts pleaded by the pro se  party, and grant all reasonable inferences \nin their favor, see Gallagher v. City of Clayton , 699 F.3d 1013, 1016 (8th Cir. \n2012) , determining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief \nrequires the Court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. Iqbal , \n556 U.S.  at 679.  \n When deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court is \nnormally limited to considering the  facts alleged in the complaint.  However, \nthe Court  may consider some materials that are part of the public record.  \nBlakley v. Schlumberger Tech. Corp. , 648 F.3d 921, 931 (8th Cir. 2011) . An \nEEOC charge of discrimination is part of the public record and may be considered  on a motion to dismiss.  Id. Additionally, the Court may consider a \npro se party's amended pleadings as supplemental to, rather than as \nsuperseding, the original pleading. NECivR 15.1(b). In determining whether \nthe plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief may be granted, the Court \nmay consider the facts in the original complaint, as well as any supplemental \nfacts in subsequent amended complaints.  8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 2 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>3 \n II. BACKGROUND  \nThe defendant hired the plaintiff as a \"Family Teacher\" in March 2020. \nFiling 20 at 7 . His duties included \"supervising and mentoring at -risk youth, \nensuring their physical and emotional well -being, and maintaining the safety \nand security of campus facilities.\" Filing 20 at 7 . He performed his duties \nwithout issue and without disciplinary action. Filing 20 at 7.  \nIn September 2022, another employee reported that the plaintiff had an \ninappropriate relationship, or inappropriate boundaries,  with a student who \nhad previously been under his care. See  filing 20 at 8; filing 1 at 4 ; filing 14 at \n5. The plaintiff was unaware of these accusations until the student's mother \nspoke to him. See filing 1 at 4 . The plaintiff denies having such a relationship, \nand he went to his supervisor for \" clarification and redress.\" Filing 20 at 8 . \nHowever, the defendant \"issued a directive prohibiting the youth from \ncommunicating with Plaintiff under any circumstances.\" Filing 20 at 8 . The \nplaintiff's interactions with the student were \"closely monitored.\" Filing 20 at \n8. Other staff members  also \"disseminated misinformation\" about the \nplaintiff's relationship with the student.  \nThe following is a timeline of events after the above allegations:  \n• December 2022: The plaintiff filed his first charge of \ndiscrimination  with the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission and the Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission . \nSee filing 1 at 5 -6. \n• March 2023: The defendant terminated the plaintiff's employment . \nFiling 19 -1 at 6. \n• April 2023 : The plaintiff filed his second charge of discrimination, \nincluding a claim for retaliation . Filing 19 -1 at 6. \n• September 2023: The plaintiff received his right -to-sue letter for 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 3 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>4 \n his first charge of discrimination  from the EEOC. Filing 1 at 7 . \n• October 2023 : The plaintiff filed this lawsuit. Filing 1 .  \n• April 2024 : The EEOC signed a right -to-sue letter for the second \ncharge of discrimination. Filing 19- 5 at 1. \n• October 2024 : The plaintiff amended his complaint to include \nclaims for retaliation , and other federal and state law claims . See \nfiling 14 .  \nIII. MOTION TO STRIKE  \nThe defendant moved to strike the plaintiff's brief in opposition to the \nmotion to dismiss, filing 22 , because the brief was untimely, and because the \ndefendant suspects the plaintiff may have used generative artificial \nintelligence to cite to fictitious cases. See filing 26 at 1, 2.  \n\"A local rule imposing a requirement of form must not be enforced in a \nway that causes a party to lose any right because of a nonwillful failure to \ncomply.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 83(a)(2). The plaintiff has not shown good cause for his \nuntimely brief , filed several months after the defendant's motion. \nNevertheless, in light of the fact that the plaintiff is proceeding pro se , the \nCourt will deny the defendant's motion to strike on this basis and has \nconsidered the plaintiff's tardy submissions. See Garcia v. Bimbo Bakeries \nUSA, Inc. , No. 8:20 -cv-232, 2022 WL 1462983, at *1 n.1 (D. Neb. May 6, 2022) .  \nThe defendant also argues that some of the cases cited by the plaintiff \ncontain mismatched case names and case citations, and the defendant believes the plaintiff utilized generative artificial intelligence in drafting his brief. \nGenerative artificial intelligence is known to result in the sort of fictional or \"hallucinatory\" citations the plaintiff provides. See , e.g., Mata v. Avianca, Inc. , \n678 F. Supp. 3d 443 , 457 (S.D.N.Y. 2023). Further, the defendant points out 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 4 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>5 \n that the plaintiff has quoted language that does not appear in the case cited.  \nThis Court's local rules permit the use of generative artificial intelligence \nprograms, but all parties, including pro se parties, must certify \"that to the \nextent such a program was used, a human signatory of the document verified \nthe accuracy of all generated text, including all citations and legal authority,\" \nNECivR 7.1(d)(4)(B). The plaintiff's brief contains no such certification, nor \ndoes the plaintiff deny using artificial intelligence. See filing 27 at 9 .  \nFrom the Court's review of the plaintiff's brief, most citations are not \nhallucinatory. But the plaintiff undeniably cites to cases that do not support \nthe stated legal proposition. For example, the plaintiff asserts that \"courts \nmust 'accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true.'\" Filing 22 at 3 . \nHe attributes th e quoted language to Braden v. Wal -Mart Stores, Inc. , 588 F.3d \n585, 595 (8th Cir. 2009) . The quote is a boilerplate recitation of the standard \non a motion to dismiss, and any number of cases contain that exact language —\nbut not Braden, the case to which the plaintiff attributed the quote.  \nThe plaintiff characterizes the mismatched citations as \"[t]ypographical \nerrors or minor misstatements.\" Filing 27 at 9 . That may be true for some of \nthe mistakes —for example, the case Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178 (1962)  is \ncorrectly cited , and it immediately precedes a citation for the nonexistent \n\"Foman v. Arnold, \" which might be explained as a typographical error . See \nfiling 22 at 13 . But not all the mistakes are so innocent , such as the plaintiff's \ncitation to the nonexistent  \"Brown v. Maple Tree Homes, Inc. ,\" purported to be \na Nebraska case, the citation to which directs to a Wisconsin Supreme Court \ndecision . Filing 22 at 12.  This mistake resembles the hallucinatory citations \nseen in other cases , and is a mistake the plaintiff had an obligation to correct \nbefore filing his brief . See Strong v. Rushmore Loan Mgmt. S ervs. , LLC, No. \n8:24- cv-352, 2025 WL 100904, at *6 (D. Neb. Jan. 15, 2025) . 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 5 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>6 \n The plaintiff also  asserts that while the citations may be erroneous, the \nstatements of law are not. The Court agrees that the plaintiff made no \nsubstantive misrepresentations of law , so striking the brief is not the \nappropriate remedy. However, the plaintiff should take notice of the fact that \nsuch conduct, if repeated, could subject him to sanctions, even as  a pro se  \nlitigant. See Ferris v. Amazon.com Servs., LLC , No. 3:24 -cv-304, 2025 WL \n1122235, at *2 (N.D. Miss. Apr. 16, 2025) ; Rubio v. D.C. , No. 23- cv-719, 2024 \nWL 4957373, at *4 (D.D.C. Dec. 3, 2024) ; Vargas v. Salazar , No. 4:23- CV-4267, \n2024 WL 4804091, at *3 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 1, 2024) ; Martin v. Hawai'i, No. 24 -cv-\n294, 2024 WL 3877013, at *2 (D. Haw. Aug. 20, 2024) .  \nIV. MOTION TO DISMISS  \n1.  DISABILITY AND AGE DISCRIMINATION  \nIn his first and second amended complaints, the plaintiff asserts that he \nwas discriminated against on the basis of a disability; that the defendant did \nnot provide reasonable accommodations for his disability; and that the \ndefendant retaliated against him in violation of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. See  filing 14  at 1; filing 20 at 2.  \n But the  plaintiff has not alleged the existence of any disability , real or \nperceived,  which might indicate he is protected by the ADA . See Denson v. \nSteak 'n Shake, Inc. , 910 F.3d 368, 370- 71 (8th Cir. 2018) . The plaintiff also \ndid not check the box for disability discrimination in either of his charges of \ndiscrimination with the EEOC  or the NEOC . See filing 1 at 5 -6; filing 19- 1 at \n7. He therefore  failed to admini stratively exhaust the se claims, so they are \nsubject to dismissal . See Neb. Rev. Stat. § 48- 1118;  Weatherly v. Ford Motor \nCo., 994 F.3d 940, 944- 45 (8th Cir. 2021) . His various claims for discrimination, \nretaliation, or failure to accommodate on the basis of a disability  are 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 6 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>7 \n summarily dismissed.1 \n To the extent the plaintiff asserted a claim for age discrimination, see \nfiling 14 at 1 , this claim will also be summarily dismissed. Like the disability \nclaim, this claim  was not administratively exhausted . See filing 1 at 5 -6; filing \n19-1 at 7; Moses v. Dassault Falcon Jet -Wilmington Corp , 894 F. 3d 911, 919-\n20 (8th Cir. 2018) . Nor do any pled facts support that the defendant took this \naction because of his age.  \n2. RETALIATION  \nTitle VII prohibits employers from retaliating  against an employee who \nengaged in a protected activity. E.g., Hunt v. Neb. Pub. Power Dist. , 282 F.3d \n1021, 1028 (8th Cir. 2002) . The plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination against \nthe defendant in 2022, which is a protected action under Title VII. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 12203(a) . He was subsequently terminated. But the plaintiff's \nretaliation claims are time -barred.  \nFederal regulations require that civil actions must be filed no later than \n90 days after receiving a right -to-sue letter. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e- 5(f)(1); 29 C.F.R. \n§ 1601.28(e) . A plaintiff must file a separate charge of discrimination for each \ndiscrete employment action. See  Moses , 894 F.3d at 920. While harassment \n \n1 The plaintiff appears to assert that the defendant violated the ADA by retaliating against \nhim for filing a Title VII complaint. See filing 22 at 10. The ADA did not create a stand -alone \nprovision barring retaliation for reporting any  perceived wrong; it merely makes it unlawful \nto retaliate  against an  individual who \"opposed any act or practice made unlawful\" by the \nADA —that is, discrimination on the basis of a disability . See § 12203(a). The plaintiff has not \nalleged that he was discriminated against on the basis of a disability  or that he reported any \nconduct made unlawful by the ADA, and so he has not stated any  claim, for retaliation or \notherwise, under the ADA.  8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 7 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>8 \n (actionable as a hostile work environment) is considered a \"continuing \nviolation ,\" a termination, or a constructive discharge,  is a discrete act, and \ncannot be  reasonably expected to result from a charge of discrimination based \non a hostile work environment . See id.; Slayden v. Ctr. for Behav.  Med. , 53 \nF.4th 464, 469 (8th Cir. 2022) .  \nWhile the plaintiff timely filed his lawsuit regarding his first charge of \ndiscrimination, see filing 1 at 5 -6, his lawsuit involving the second charge of \ndiscrimination , filing 14 , was filed more than 200 days after the EEOC issued \nits right- to-sue letter. See  filing 19 -5 at 1. The plaintiff amended his complaint \nto include  claims for retaliation and constructive discharge  more than 200 days \nafter the EEOC issued its right- to-sue letter.  He therefore failed to comply with \nthe 90-day deadline imposed by federal law.  \nThe plaintiff's earlier timely -filed lawsuit based on his first charge of \ndiscrimination cannot save his untimely amended complaint related to his \nclaims for a retaliatory termination. See Moses , 894 F.3d at 920; Slayden, 53 \nF.4th at 469. Any claims arising out of his second charge of discrimination are \ntherefore dismissed as untimely.2 \n3. PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS  \nIn his second amended complaint, the plaintiff asserts the defendant \nviolated his constitutional procedural due process rights . See filing 20 at 36. To \nstate such a claim , a plaintiff must allege that the government deprived him of \nsome \"life, liberty, or property\" interest, without sufficient process. E.g., Krentz \n \n2 The plaintiff also appears to assert he was subjected to a retaliatory hostile work \nenvironment after filing his charge of discrimination. See filing 20 at 20, 27. The plaintiff's \nhostile work environment claim, discussed infra,  is not time -barred, but his retaliatory hostile \nwork environment  claim, to the extent he pled one , is dismissed as untimely.  8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 8 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>9 \n v. Robertson , 228 F.3d 897, 902 (8th Cir. 2000) . Except in limited circumstances \nnot present here, see Manhattan Cmty. Access Corp. v. Halleck , 587 U.S. 802, \n809 (2019) , private entities like the defendant  are not state actors and are not \nsubject to the due process requirements of the Constitution. U.S. Const. \namend. V; Mathura v. Council for Human Servs. Home Care Servs., Inc. , 107 \nF.3d 3 (2nd Cir. 1997 ); Hudson v. Wilford , No. 16 -cv-58, 2016 WL 11486907, at \n*5-6 (D. Minn. May 11, 2016) .  \nTo the extent  the plaintiff alleges he was terminated contrary to the \nprocedures promised by unspecified \"internal policies\" or \"employee \nhandbooks,\" see filing 20 at 36, any remedy lies in state , not federal , law. See, \ne.g., Goff- Hamel v. Obstetricians & Gynecologists, P.C. , 588 N.W.2d 798, 801 \n(Neb. 1999) ; Hillie v. Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company , 512 N.W.2d 358 \n(Neb. 1994) . The plaintiff has failed to state a claim for any violation of his \nfederal constitutional rights.  \n4. TITLE VII \n The only federal claim remaining is the plaintiff's Title VII sex \ndiscrimination claims. The plaintiff alleges he was discriminated against on \nthe basis of his sex, and he  appears to allege several adverse employment \nactions: \"false accusations, undue scrutiny, and restrictions that were not \nimposed on similarly situated employees who were of a different sex.\" Filing \n14 at 9- 10; see also filing 20 at 11.  The Court will construe the plaintiff's \ncomplaints  as alleging that he was subject to a hostile work environment , \nwhich is an adverse employment action.  See, e.g., Bush v. Duncan Aviation, \nInc., No. 4:24 -cv-3057, 2025 WL 1068077, at *3 (D. Neb. Apr. 9, 2025) .  \nBut anti-discrimination laws do not prohibit all verbal or physical \nharassment and do not create a \"general civility code.\" See, e.g., Sellars v. 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 9 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>10 \n CRST Expedited, Inc. , 13 F.4th 681, 701 (8th Cir. 2021) ; Shaver v. Indep. Stave \nCo., 350 F.3d 716, 721 (8th Cir. 2003) . At the pleading stage, the Court must \ndetermine whether the alleged harassment is \"severe or pervasive enough to \ncreate an objectively hostile or abusive work environment. \" See Blomker v. \nJewell, 831 F.3d 1051, 1056 (8th Cir. 2016) . The Court must consider the \ntotality of the circumstances, including the frequency of the discriminatory \nconduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating or \nmerely an offensive utterance, and whether the conduct unreasonably \ninterfered with the employe's work performance. Stewart v. Rise, Inc. , 791 F.3d \n849, 860 (8th Cir. 2015) . \n The plaintiff alleges that he was \"closely monitored\" and was \" not \nallowed\"  to interact with one student. See filing 14 at 9.  He also alleges his \ncoworkers made false statements about him.  While he alleged he was subject \nto \"unwarranted restrictions,\" see filing 14 at 9, the only specific \"restriction\" \nalleged is that the defendant \"scrutinized\" his relationship with one particular \nstudent.  \nRegarding the alleged false statements, the plaintiff has not alleged with \nany particularity who made defamatory comments, who they were made to, \nwhen they occurred, or how often they occurred.  There simply is not enough, \neven in 86 pages of pleadings ( filing 1 ; filing 14 ; filing 20 ), to support an \ninference that the plaintiff was subjected to a hostile work environment that \naffected an identifiable  term or condition of his employment. See Muldrow v. \nCity of St. Louis, 601 U.S. 346,  354-55 (2024) .  \nThe plaintiff argues that his pleadings \"outlined a sustained campaign \nof harassment\" and \"describe[d] specific incidents where he was publicly \nhumiliated by superiors,\" filing 27 at 3 , but the Court is unable to find  any such \npled \"specific incidents\" in any of the plaintiff's  complaints. Rather, the 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 10 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>11 \n pleadings contain unadorned accusations —that his \"professional reputation\" \nsuffered , filing 20 at 8 , and that he was publicly stigmatized and subject to \n\"unwarranted restrictions,\" see filing 20 at 40— that are too vague to state a \nclaim. See Iqbal ,  556 U.S. at 678. Again, the complaint does not explain when \nthese incidents occurred, or how often, or who was involved, or what , \nspecifically, was said or done.  \nThe plaintiff alleged  that his \"job performance remained exemplary\"  \nthrough  the period the alleged harassment took place . Filing 20 at 9 . This \nnegates  any inference that the harassment interfered with the plaintiff's job . \nSee Stewart , 791 F.3d at 860.  The plaintiff's coworkers ' comments may have \nbeen rude or even offensive, but they were not so  severe or pervasive as to state \na claim for a hostile work environment. Generally speaking, co- worker \nostracism and gossip are not actionable under Title VII. See  Franken v. \nMcCarthy , No. 2:19 -cv-2172, 2020 WL 2615021, at *3 (E.D. Cali. May 22, 2020)  \n(collecting cases); accord  Anda v. Wickes Furniture Co., 517 F.3d 526, 532 (8th \nCir. 2008) . \n The plaintiff has not alleged any conduct that constitutes direct \ndiscrimination , such as coworkers or supervisors making  disparaging \ncomments about men . To plead a claim for sex discrimination, a plaintiff must \nassert facts that plausibly show the defendant \"manifested bias relevant to\" \nsome alleged adverse employment action. Warmington v. Bd. of Regents of \nUniv. of Minn. , 455 F. Supp. 3d 871, 882 (D. Minn. 2020)  (citing Univ. of Tex. \nSw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar , 570 U.S. 338, 343 (2013) ). \nWhile the plaintiff alleges he was subject to restrictions not imposed on \nother employees, h e has not alleged that women were treated better than men, \nor that those restrictions were imposed because of  his sex. See  id. Based on the \nfacts in the complaints , an employee reported that the plaintiff had 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 11 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>12 \n inappropriate boundaries with a student, and the defendant responded to that \nreport. This is insufficient to  support an inference that the defendant's conduct \nwas motivated by some unlawful bias against men .  \nV. AMENDED COMPLAINT  \nThe Court has thoroughly considered the facts in the plaintiff's second \namended complaint. That pleading fails to state a claim upon which relief can \nbe granted, so the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint  (filing 21 ) will be denied as futile . See Hillesheim v. Myron's Cards \nand Gifts, Inc. , 897 F.3d 953, 955 (8th Cir. 2018) . The plaintiff appears to \nrequest another chance to amend his pleading:  \"Should the Court find any \naspect of the pleadings insufficient, Plaintiff is fully prepared to address those \ndeficiencies through amendment.\" Filing 22 at 13- 14; see also filing 27 at 10  \n(requesting leave to \"Supplement or Clarify If Necessary\") .  \nDistrict courts in the Eighth Circuit, including  this district , have \ncriticized \"shotgun\" complaints where a plaintiff brings every conceivable \nclaim. Gurman v. Metro Housing and Redevelopment Authority, 842 F. Supp. \n2d 1151, 1153 (D. Minn. 2011) ; Harrington v. Strong, 363 F. Supp. 3d 984, 993 \nn.5 (D. Neb. 2019) . It is the plaintiff's obligation, under Rules 8 and 11, to \nreasonably investigate his claims, plead only colorable claims, and plead those claims concisely and clearly so that a defendant can readily respond to them \nand the Court can readily resolve them . See Gurman , 842 F. Supp. 2d at 1153 . \nThe plaintiff has \"essentially coughed up an unsightly hairball of factual and \nlegal allegations,\" leaving the defendant and the Court to sort out whether any of his claims are viable. Id.    \nOverall, the facts in each complaint  remain largely unchanged . Compare \nfiling 20 at 7 -10, with filing 14 at 7 -11. The plaintiff added and removed various 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 12 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>13 \n theories of recovery.  But it is the well- pleaded facts, not legal theories or \nconclusions, that determine the adequacy of the complaint. Mickelson v. Cnty. \nof Ramsey, 823 F.3d 918, 923 (8th Cir. 2016) . The plaintiff has already had \nthree bites at the apple and has been unable to muster specific  allegations \nabout the defendant's alleged misconduct.  His unadorned assertions that he \nwas scrutinized, monitored, and defamed  are too vague to state a claim. The \nCourt is not persuaded that justice requires yet another opportunity for the \nplaintiff to amend his complaint, given the significant deficiencies discussed \nabove. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2); Wilburn v. Pepsi- Cola Bottling Co. , 492 F.2d \n1288, 1290 (8th Cir. 1974) ; Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) . The \nplaintiff's requests to \"supplement or clarify ,\" or file an additional amended \ncomplaint , are denied.  \nVI. CONCLUSION  \nThe plaintiff asserts the defendant denied him an opportunity to respond \nto false accusations about his relationship with a student, and he was  treated \nunfairly because of those accusations. However, he has not alleged any facts \nthat support an inference that the defendant was motivated by discriminatory \nbias based on the plaintiff's membership in some protected class. Therefore, he \nhas not stated a claim for a discrimination  under any federal  employment law.  \nThe Court may  continue to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any \nstate -law claim s. See 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a)  and (c)(3); Carlsbad Tech., Inc. v. HIF \nBio, Inc. , 556 U.S. 635, 639- 40 (2009) . But the Court has \"broad discretion in \ndetermining whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction[,]\" Crest Const. II, \nInv. v. Doe , 660 F.3d 346, 359 (8th Cir. 2011) , and  \"[i]n the usual case in which \nall federal -law claims are eliminated before trial, the balance of factors to be \nconsidered under the pendent jurisdiction doctrine—judicial economy, 8:23-cv-00477-JMG-MDN     Doc # 29     Filed: 06/05/25     Page 13 of 14 - Page ID #\n<pageID>14 \n \nconvenience, fairness, and comity— will point toward declining to exercise \njurisdiction over the remaining state -law claims.\" Jones v. Faulkner Cnty., \nArkansas , 131 F.4th 869, 876 (8th Cir. 2025) . The Court finds no factor that \ndistinguishes this case from the usual case. See  id. Therefore, the  plaintiff's \ncomplaint will be dismissed  in its entirety.  \n \nIT IS ORDERED:  \n 1. The defendant's motion to strike ( filing 25 ) is denied.  \n2. The plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended \ncomplaint ( filing 21) is denied. \n3. The defendant's motion to dismiss (filing 16) is granted.  \n4. A separate judgment will be entered.  \nDated this 5th day of  June , 2025.   \nBY THE COURT:  \n \n \n  \nJohn M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This bankruptcy court case involves Augustus Intelligence, Inc., a company that aimed to develop AI solutions but faced financial difficulties leading to bankruptcy. Litigation Trustee Brian Ryniker filed claims on behalf of Augustus and certain investors against defendant Kevin Washington, primarily centering on a breach of contract involving a $50 million investment deal that Washington never funded. The court dismissed the claims due to a lack of jurisdiction for the Assigned Investor Claims and the contract being unenforceable due to its fraudulent nature.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The enforceability of a contract used in a scheme to defraud investors and whether the court has jurisdiction over third-party claims post-confirmation of a bankruptcy plan.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the breach of contract claim against Washington, ruling that the Seed Agreement used to defraud investors was unenforceable. The court also dismissed the Assigned Investor Claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction since they were third-party claims not directly related to the bankruptcy estate.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company, Augustus, which works on super-smart computer programs, went bankrupt. Some people, led by Brian, tried to sue a man named Kevin because he promised but didn't give $50 million to help Augustus get back on its feet. The court said Brian can't sue Kevin for two main reasons: one, they don't have the power to make decisions on certain claims Brian presented because they're like side arguments not directly tied to Augustus's bankruptcy; two, the promise for money was all part of a sneaky plan to trick other people into giving money, and since it was a trick, it's not a real promise the court can look at.",

(“ Augustus ” or “Debtor ”) the Trustee asserts  several claims \non behalf of the estate (the “Estate Claims ”).2  Second, in his capacity as assignee, the Trustee \n \n1 Citations to the docket in this adversary proceeding will be made using the abbreviation “Adv.

The goal of these discussions was “to develop an infrastructure revenue model focused on cryptocurrency mining, with a key component of the plan being Augustus securing the rights to CW Mining’s below- market power purchasing agreement for the two datacenters.”\n9  \nHaupt developed a detailed business plan in which Haupt would provide artificial intelligence to conduct the cryptocurrency mining, while Washington would provide the rights to the data centers and a significant cash contribution.  To achieve these plans , Haupt set a goal to raise  over \n$80 million  in new capital  for Augustus.\n10 \nHaupt’s strategy for attracting interest in outside investors was to present Washington as \nthe lead investor in Augustus.11  Washington is the son of a billionaire and Haupt believed that \nan investment from him would carry great weight with other possible investors due to his status.\n12  To that end, Haupt proposed that Washington invest $50 million first, so Haupt could \nshow the other investors that Washington was committed.  Washington, however, was reluctant  \nto invest first, as he did not want to bear the risk of an investment of this scale without substantial support from other investors.\n13   \nHaupt and Washington eventually worked through this impasse by agreeing  to a plan  in \nwhich  Washington would execute a written, unconditional subscription agreement detailing the \nterms of a $50 million  investment by Washington, and Haupt would use that agreement to raise \nat least $30 million in funds from outside investors.  Since the subscription agreement could not \n \n9 Id. at 9.  \n10 Id. \n11 Complaint at 9.  \n12 Id. at 8.  \n13 Id. at 10. \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 3 of 154 \n contain any financing contingency, Haupt and Washington agreed to house that condition in a \nsecret, verbal side deal (the “Side Deal ”).14 \n On November 25, 2018, the parties  executed a Series Seed Preferred Stock Investment \nAgreement  (the “ Seed Agreement ”) which provided that Washington would purchase over half \na million shares of Series Seed preferred stock of Augustus for just over $50M, made up of $20 million  in cash and $30 million  in the form of data center interests .\n15   \n Immediately after signing the Seed Agreement, Haupt and Washington traveled across Europe together for the purpose of meeting with prospective Augustus investors.  At these meetings, Washington was introduced as the lead investor, who committed to investing over $50 million in Augustus.  When requested, Haupt, with Washington’s knowledge and consent, provided copies of the Seed Agreement as proof of Washington’s investment.  Neither Haupt nor Washington disclosed the existence of the Side Deal to the potential investors.   \nAfter these in -person meetings, the Investors each executed separate subscription \nagreements, some in the United States and some in Europe, and wired their investments to Augustus.  At the time they made their investments, each of the Investors believed Augustus had secured $50 million from its lead investor, Washington.\n16  By early 2019, Augustus had raised \n$30 million from the Investors, plus $60 million in promised subscriptions at a $250 million pre-money valuation.   \nIn anticipation of closing on the Seed Agreement and implementing its bitcoin mining \nbusiness plan, Augustus hired dozens of new employees and expensive software engineers at a cost of millions of dollars.  However, Washington never paid the $50 million and the Seed \n \n14 Id. at 10. \n15 Id. at 11 -12. \n16 Id. at 14. \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 4 of 155 \n Agreement never closed.17  The newly hired employees were fired and bad press about Augustus \nfollowed.   \nOn April 24, 2021, Augustus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 \n(subchapter V) of the Bankruptcy Code.   \nOn May 3, 2022, the Debtor filed its plan of reorganization.18  The Plan provided for the \ntransfer of all the Debtor’s assets, including causes of action, to the Litigation  Trust to be \npursued by the Trustee for the benefit of the Litigation  Trust beneficiaries, including creditors \nand equity holders. In addition, the Plan contained a procedure whereby Augustus’ non-insider \nequity holders could elect to assign their Assigned Litigation Claims to the Trustee to be pursued. The Investors execut ed the assignment agreements.   The Plan was confirmed on July \n26, 2022.\n19  \nOn April 23, 2023, the Trustee commenced this adversary proceeding. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 157 and 1334(b) and the Amended Standing Order of Reference from the United States District Court for the District of Delaware , dated February 29, 2012.\n20  Venue is proper pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1409(a).  \n  \n \n17 Id. at 16. \n18 Revised First Amended Plan of Liquidation (“ Plan ”), D.I. 213. \n19 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, And Order Confirming the Small Business Debtor’s Revised \nFirst Amended Plan of Liquidation (“ Confirmation Order ”), D.I. 251. \n20 This includes the portions of the Complaint over which, as discussed below, I find the Court lacks \njurisdiction.

Del. 2012) (“A court has jurisdiction to determine \nwhether or not it has subject matter jurisdiction over a proceeding.”). \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 5 of 156 \n DISCUSSION  \nI. Subject Matter Jurisdiction  \n \nA.   Legal Standard  \nA motion for lack of subject -matter jurisdiction made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) “is an \nobjection to the federal court's power to adjudicate a case.”  In re PennySaver USA Publ'g, LLC , \n587 B.R. 43, 46 (Bankr. D. Del. 2018).  “As a rule, the burden of establishing that the Court has \nthe requisite jurisdiction falls on the party invoking the federal court's jurisdiction.”  Id.  \nDefendant Washington first argues that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over \nthe Assigned Investor C laims because they are claims among non -debtors  that have no relation to \nthe bankruptcy case.  \n“[B]ankruptcy courts have subject matter jurisdiction over four types of matters, pending \nreferral from the district court: ‘(1) cases under title 11, (2) proceedings arising under title 11, (3) proceedings arising in a case under title 11, and (4) proceedings related to a case under title 11.’” In re Millennium  Lab Holdings  II, LLC , 562 B.R.  614, 621 (Bankr.  D. Del.  2016)  (quoting 28 \nU.S.C. § 157).  “ Cases falling under the first three categories are typically referred to as core \nproceedings, whereas proceedings ‘related to’ a case under title 11 are designated as non- core \nproceedings.”  Id.  at 621.   The Third Circuit has held that a matter is “core” if it “invokes a \nsubstantive right provided by title 11 or if it is a proceeding that, by its nature, could arise only in the context of a bankruptcy case.”  In re Marcus Hook Dev. Park, Inc., 943 F.2d 261, 267 (3d Cir. 1991) (quoting Beard v. Braunstein, 914 F.2d 434, 444 (3d Cir. 1990); s ee also 28 U.S.C. § \n157(b)(1)(B)  (setting  forth  non- exhaustive  list of  the types  of matters  that are considered  “core”  \nproceedings).  \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 6 of 157 \n  “Distinctions between ‘arising under,’ ‘arising in’ (both core) and ‘related to’ (non- core) \nproceedings are not relevant to a determination of subject matter jurisdiction when the \nproceeding has been filed before plan confirmation.”  In  re Penson Worldwide, Inc. , 587 B.R.  6, \n12 (Bankr.  D. Del.  2018).  “ Post-confirmation, however, bankruptcy jurisdiction over non- core \nproceedings narrows; it exists only if there is ‘a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or \nproceeding.’  In contrast, in core proceedings the close nexus test does not apply; bankruptcy \njurisdi ction remains the same as  it was pre -confirmation.”  Penson, 587 B.R. at 12.  As the \nparties here agree that the claims at issue in Defendant’s Motion are not “core” matters, \njurisdiction over them turns on whether the “close nexus” test is satisfied.  See Resorts Int’l Fin., \nInc. v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (In re Resorts Int’l., Inc.) , 372 F.3d 154, 166- 67 (3d Cir. 2004)  \n(after a plan of reorganization has been confirmed, “the essential inquiry” to determine whether a \nBankruptcy Court has jurisdiction over non- core proceedings is “whether there is a close nexus \nto the bankruptcy plan or proceeding.”) .    \n“At the post -confirmation stage, the claim must affect an integral aspect of the \nbankruptcy process –there must be a close nexus to the bankruptcy plan or proceeding.”  In re \nResorts Int'l, Inc., 372 F.3d 154, 167 (3d Cir. 2004).  “To a certain extent, litigation trusts by \ntheir nature maintain a connection to the bankruptcy even after the plan has been confirmed.”  Id.  \n“The question is how close a connection warrants post -confirmation bankruptcy jurisdiction.”  \nId.  “Matters that affect the interpretation, implementation, consummation, execution, or \nadministration of the confirmed plan will typically have the requisite close nexus.”  Id.   “Under \nthose circumstances, bankruptcy court jurisdiction would not raise the specter of ‘unending \njurisdiction’ over continuing trusts.”  \n \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 7 of 158 \n B. Analysis \nThe Trustee makes several arguments in support of jurisdiction.  First, he argues that this \nCourt’s continued jurisdiction over this matter was expressly contemplated by the parties and \nprovided for in the Plan and the Confirmation Order.21  This argument is not persuasive.  \nRetention of jurisdiction provisions within a plan alone are insufficient to grant subject matter \njurisdiction because “neither the bankruptcy court nor the parties can write their own \njurisdictional ticket.”  Resorts Int’l Fin., Inc. v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (In re Resorts Int’l., \nInc.), 372 F.3d 154, 161 (3d Cir. 2004).  In other words, “[i]f there is no jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1334 or 28 U.S.C. § 157, retention of jurisdiction provisions in a plan of reorganization \nor trust agreement are fundamentally irrelevant.”  Id.  Bankruptcy courts may give effect to such \nprovisions only where there is subject matter jurisdiction underlying the action.  Id.   Thus, where \nthe matter falls within the “related to” category of jurisdiction, retention of jurisdiction \nprovisions are effective only where the dispute shares the requisite close nexus to the \nbankruptcy. \nThe Trustee acknowledges that the provisions do not themselves confer jurisdiction but \nargues that they provide proof of a close nexus, citing the AstroPower  decision, where the Court \nheld that the retention of jurisdiction provision’s inclusion of the specific cause of action at issue \ndemonstrated a close nexus between the claim and the bankruptcy case.   AstroPower Liquidating \nTr. v. Xantrex Tech., Inc. (In re AstroPower Liquidating Tr.) , 335 B.R. 309, 325 (Bankr. D. Del. \n \n21 See Plan §6.4 (providing “[t]he Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction of this case with regard to the \nfollowing matters: . . . (v) to adjudicate any cause of action which may exist in favor of the Debtor, \nincluding preference and fraudulent transfer causes of action and Assigned Litigation Claims; and (vi) to \nhear any other matter not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code”); Confirmation Order \n¶ 30 (“[t]he Court will retain jurisdiction over the Chapter 11 Case, all matters arising out of or related to \nthe Chapter 11 Case and the Plan, the matters set forth in Article XIV of the Plan, and other applicable \nprovisions of the Plan, including jurisdiction to . . . e) adjudicate any Cause of Action, including \nAvoidance Actions and Assigned Litigation Claims”).   \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 8 of 159 \n 2005).  But AstroPower  is distinguishable on its facts.  There, as the Court noted, the Plan \n“specifically describe[d] an action over which the Court had ‘related to’ jurisdiction pre-\nconfirmation and expressly provide[d] for the retention of such jurisdiction to liquidate that \nclaim for the benefit of the estate's creditors[.]” Id.   Here,  however, unlike the claims at issue in \nAstroPower , the Assigned Investor Claims are neither claims over -which the Court had pre-\nconfirmation jurisdiction, nor claims that will be liquidated for the benefit of the estate’s \ncreditors.   They are instead third-party claims never subject to this Court’s jurisdiction, which \nwill be liquidated for the benefit of only those equity holders who assigned them.  In other \nwords, the Assigned Investor Claims are claims by non-debtors against non-debtors.  As the \nThird Circuit has made clear, “bankruptcy jurisdiction will not extend to a dispute between non-\ndebtors unless the dispute creates ‘the logical possibility that the estate will be affected.’”  In re \nResorts Int'l, Inc., 372 F.3d 154, 165 (3d Cir. 2004) (quoting In re Federal –Mogul Global, Inc., \n300 F.3d 368, 380 (3d Cir.2002)).  The dispute at the center of the Assigned Investor Claims \ndoes not.   \nThe Trustee disagrees, noting that in the event any proceeds aris e from a combination of \nboth Assigned Investor Claims and Estate Claims  the Plan provides that such proceeds would be \nshared by all creditors.22  But th e fact that the Plan provides for this remote contingency is not \nenough.  Even in the event of such a scenario, the logical outcome would be that the proceeds \nwould be allocated along claim lines .  In other words, the Investors would still likely be the only \nones to receive proceeds arising from the Assigned Investor Claims and the only proceeds likely \nto be allocated to the creditor body as a whole are those arising from  Estate Claims.  Thus, even \n \n22 See Plan  at 3-8. \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 9 of 1510 \n under the “combination proceeds” scenario, the dispute at the center of the  Assigned Investor \nClaims is not one that will affect the estate in its entirety.  \nFor these reasons, the Motion is granted with respect to Counts II through VIII for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction.   \nII. Failure to State a Claim  \nA.   Legal Standard  \nA motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) serves to test \nthe sufficiency of the complaint, and a court’s role is to determine whether the plaintiff is entitled \nto offer evidence in support of its claims. Semerenko  v. Cendant Corp., 223 F.3d 165, 173 (3d \nCir. 2000); Paul v. Intel Corp. (In re Intel Corp. Microprocessor Antitrust Litig.) , 496 F. Supp. \n2d 404, 407 (D. Del. 2007) (citing Kost v. Kozakiewicz , 1 F.3d 176, 183 (3d Cir. 1993)). To \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must allege well- pleaded facts with sufficient detail to \n“state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n570 (2007); Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 210 (3d Cir. 2009) ( citing Ashcr oft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).  \nThe Third Circuit has adopted a two- part analysis that courts must employ when deciding \na motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Fowler , 578 F.3d at 210. “First, the factual and \nlegal elements of a claim should be separated” with the reviewing court accepting “all of the complaint’s well- pleaded facts as true, but . . . disregard[ing] any legal conclusions.” Id . at 210-\n11. Next, the reviewing court must “determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show that the plaintiff has a ‘plausible claim for relief.’” Id . (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. \nat 679); Gellert v. Coltec Indus., Inc. (In re Crucible Materials Corp.) , Nos. 09- 11582 & 11-\n53885, 2012 WL 5360945, at *3 (Bankr. D. Del. Oct. 31, 2012). “The plausibility standard is not akin to a ‘probability requirement,’ but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 10 of 1511 \n has acted unlawfully.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679. “Where the well -pleaded facts do not permit the \ncourt to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged—but it has \nnot 'show[n]'—'that the pleader is entitled to relief.’” Id. at 679 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2)). This “plausibility” determination will be “a context- specific task that requires the \nreviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Id. \nB. Analysis  \nWith the dismissal of the Assigned Investor Claims, only one claim remains against \nDefendant Washington.  In Count I, the Trustee asserts a claim for breach of contract arising out of Washington’s failure to provide the $50 million consideration contemplated by the Seed Agreement.  Washington raises several arguments as to why the Trustee has failed to state a \nclaim for breach of contract, but I need only reach the first: that the contract is  unenforceable.  \nWashington argues that the Trustee’s breach of contract claim is barred by the doctrine of in \npari delicto .  “In pari delicto, Latin for ‘in equal fault,’ is a general rule that courts will not \nextend aid to either of the parties to a criminal act or listen to their complaints against each other but will leave them where their own act has placed them.”  Geronta Funding v. Brighthouse Life Ins. Co., 284 A.3d 47, 64 (Del. 2022) (internal citations omitted).  A separate concept , but one \nthat often overlaps wit h in pari delicto is  the principle  that agreements made for the purpose of \nperpetrating a fraud  are unenforceable.  15 C\nORBIN ON CONTRACTS § 85.1 (2025) (noting that it \nis an “accepted tenet of contract law” that bargains made for the purpose of defrauding third \npersons “contradict[] public policy and cannot be enforced).  While the parties refer to the two \nconcepts interchangeably, it is the latter that is mostly clearly applicable here.   \n Though the precise argument  varied in form across the briefing and at oral argument, the \ncrux of Washington’s position  is that because the Debtor was  alleged to be at least equally  \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 11 of 1512 \n responsible for the fraudulent scheme to use the Seed Agreement to lure investors, the Trustee \n(who stands in the shoes of the Debtor) is now barred from enforcing it.  I agree.     \nThe Trustee alleges in the Complaint that the primary purpose of  the Seed Agreement \nwas to  convince  prospective investors that Washington was already committed to invest $50 \nmillion, even though, pursuant to parties’ the Side Agreement, he  was not :         \n27.  In order to be able to convince outside investors to invest in Augustus, Haupt \nneeded to present Washington, the son of a billionaire, as the lead investor in \nAugustus. The key to his fundraising efforts was to show that Washington had \nentered into an iron- clad subscription agreement where he committed to invest in \nAugustus. \n \n28. However, unbeknownst to Haupt at the time, Washington was not in a position to contribute the datacenters to Augustus as he did not have management control over CW Investment Partners and CW Mining. Further, [Washington’s counsel] , \nJoon Hur (“ Hur”) [ ], indicated that Washington did not want to bear the risk of an \ninvestment of this scale without substantial support from other investors . \n 29. Haupt advised Washington and his attorneys that several wealthy individuals located in the United States and Europe were interested in investing in Augustus, and that Washington’s $50 million investment was key to securing these additional \ninvestments.   \n 30. In screenshots of WhatsApp Message sent on November 22, 2018 between Hur and Augustus’ general counsel, Ramsey Taylor (“ Taylor ”), Haupt previously \nindicated that he did not want any conditions attached to Washington’s investment, stating “[o]bviously we are working on the other $30 million but we have to show other investors our lead investor, Kevin!.” Haupt also wrote: “ I just want to show \nthem [“the Contract we have with Kevin”] so they give the final signature and we \ncan start putting the funds from their side into Augustus Intelligence .” Upon \ninformation and belief, the deal between Haupt and Washington nearly fell apart over the issue of who would commit first to invest: Washington or Haupt’s outside investors. \n \n   * * * *   \n 45. [ ] Haupt and Washington attended breakfast and lunch meetings with prospective investors, including the Augustus Investors, to discuss the prospect of investing in Augustus. At these meeting, Washington was introduced as the lead investor, having comm itted to invest over $50 million in Augustus. When \nrequested, Haupt, with Washington’s full knowledge and consent, provided copies \nof the KW Seed Agreement as proof of Washington’s investment. Neither Haupt \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 12 of 1513 \n nor Washington informed the prospective investors at these meetings about the Side \nDeal when making these representations.  \n \n46.  After these in -person meetings, the Augustus Investors each executed separate \nsubscription agreements, some in the United States and some in Europe, and wired their investments to Augustus in the United States. At the time they made their \ninvestments, each of the Augustus Investors believed Augustus had secured $50 \nmillion from its lead investor, Washington. They relied on this representation as it \nwas critical to their decision to invest.  \n 47. Upon information and belief, Washington never intended to close on his obligations under the KW Seed Agreement because he was counting on the \nexistence of the Side Agreement, which, while unenforceable, would have been material to a reasonably prudent investor, such as  the Augustus Investors, when \nmaking a decision whether or not to invest in Augustus. No prudent investor, including the Augustus Investors, would have made a decision to invest had the existence of the Side Agreement been disclosed to them in advance.\n23 \n \nThese allegations demonstrate that  the Seed Agreement was  not just incidental to  the alleged \nfraud, it was the cornerstone  of the entire plan .  This is perhaps most apparent in a single \nallegation, which states:   \nHaupt and Washington agreed to a plan where Washington would execute a written, unconditional subscription agreement agreeing to invest $50 million in cash and in-kind assets into Augustus, and Haupt would use that agreement to raise at least $30 million in additional funds from outside investors. Since the subscription agreement could not contain any financing contingency, Haupt and Washington agreed to house that condition in a secret, verbal side deal [ ].\n24 \n \nThe only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from these alleged facts is that the Seed Agreement \nwas entered into for the purpose of perpetrating a fraud and is therefore an illegal contract .      \n “[C]ourts generally will not enforce an illegal contract based upon ‘the elementary \nprinciple that one who has himself participated in a violation of law cannot be permitted to assert in a court of justice any right founded upon or growing out of the illegal transaction.’”  Sender v. Simon, 84 F.3d 1299, 1307 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Gibbs & Sterrett Mfg. Co. v. Brucker , 111 \n \n23 Complaint ¶¶ 27 – 47. \n24 Complaint ¶ 31.  \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 13 of 1514 \n U.S. 597, 601 (1884)).  The facts of the Sender  case are remarkably similar  to those alleged here .  \nThere, the bankruptcy trustee asserted claims against investors in a limited partnership to recover \ndistributions received by the investors that exceed ed their contributions  and were therefore in \nviolation of the partnership agreement.  The investors moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the partnership agreement  was unenforceable because the partnership  was created as \npart of an illegal P onzi scheme.   The Court agreed : \nThough the Debtor  Partnerships were not illegal per se, it is beyond peradventure \nthey were created and operated in furtherance of a fraudulent and illegal \ninvestment scheme. To the extent HSA L.P. was created as a vehicle to further the Ponzi scheme and u tilized to give the scheme a veneer of legitimacy, it was in \nutter complicity with Mr. Donahue's fraud.  HSA L.P., acting through Mr. Donahue and HIA Inc., fraudulently induced the participation of Mr. Simon and the Baker Partnership in the scheme by misre presenting both the true nature of the \nHedged Investments fund and the partnership's role in perpetuation of the fraud. In other words, with regard to its interactions with Mr. Simon and the Baker Partnership, HSA L.P.'s purpose was an illegal one. It furt hered this illegal \npurpose by fraudulently inducing Mr. Simon and the Baker Partnership to execute the partnership agreements.  \n \nMr. Sender, standing in the shoes of HSA L.P., now seeks to enforce the partnership agreements against Mr. Simon and the Baker Partnership. Following the suggestions of our fellow jurists, this court will not aid in the enforcement of an agreement that was  fraudulently procured in furtherance of an illegal \npurpose.  See Merrill , 77 Bankr. at 857;  Tri-Q, 404 P.2d at 498. That Mr. Sender \nacts as a trustee in bankruptcy cannot lend strength to the partnership's position.  \n \nSender v. Simon, 84 F.3d 1299, 1307 (10th Cir. 1996) .   \n This analysis applies with equal force to the facts of this case. The facts alleged in the \nComplaint make clear that the Seed Agreement was a tool created to lend legitimacy to an d offer \nassurances about an  otherwise risky investment proposal .  While the Trustee argues  that the \nunderlying transaction here, unlike the Ponzi scheme in Sender , was not illegal, this does nothing \nto alter the analysis .  The unwillingness  of courts to enforce illegal contracts is not limited to \ncontracts that are illegal on their face:  \nCase 23-50370-TMH    Doc 74    Filed 03/26/25    Page 14 of 1515 \n A bargain may be illegal by reason of the wrongful purpose of one or both of the \nparties making it. This is true even though the performances bargained for are not \nin themselves illegal and even though in the absence of the illegal purpose the bargain would be valid and enforceable. A party who makes such a bargain in \nfurtherance of his wrongful purpose cannot enforce it….  \nTri-Q, Inc. v. Sta- Hi Corp., 63 Cal. 2d 199, 404 P.2d 486, 498 (Cal. 1965)  (quoting 6A Corbin \non Contracts § 1518, at 744 (1962)).  Here, even assuming the Seed Agreement, standing alone, \nis lawful, the fact that it was allegedly used by the Debtor in furtherance of a fraud  compels the \nconclusion that  the Debtor is barred from enforcing the agreement as a matter of  public policy.  \n For these reasons, Count I of the Complaint is also dismissed.   The parties shall confer and submit an appropriate form of order under certification of \ncounsel.     \nDated:  March 26, 2025     ____________________________________ \n       John T.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Melissa Thornley et al. v. Clearview AI, Inc., plaintiffs filed a class-action lawsuit against Clearview AI under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) for profiting from their biometric data without consent. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state court, as the federal court found it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under Article III, because the plaintiffs did not allege a concrete injury-in-fact. The case involves AI as Clearview used an AI-driven facial recognition application to scrape social media images for biometric data.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs had Article III standing due to an alleged injury-in-fact under BIPA when they did not claim any specific personal injury but only statutory damages and attorney’s fees for the sale of biometric information.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Clearview AI failed to establish that the plaintiffs suffered a concrete injury-in-fact required for Article III standing, thus granting the motion to remand the case back to state court where such Article III constraints do not apply.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: The plaintiffs sued Clearview AI because they believe the company illegally made money by creating and using a facial recognition tool that collected their facial data without consent. The court decided they should take this case to a state court instead of federal court because they didn't show they were directly hurt in a way the federal court would recognize.

Before the Court is \nplaintiffs’ motion to remand pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c).  For the reasons stated below, the \nCourt grants plaintiffs’ motion and remands this  lawsuit to the Circuit Court of Cook County. \nBackground  Plaintiffs bring a one-count putative cla ss action complaint under the Illinois Biometric \nInformation Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”), a consumer privacy statute.  In their \ncomplaint, plaintiffs allege that Clearview is an artificial intelligence compan y that secretly created a \ndatabase of over three billion facial scans.  Clea rview created a facial recognition application by \nscraping photographs posted on social medi a platforms, among other sources.  \n Unlike plaintiffs in other recent lawsuits against Clearview,\n1 the present plaintiffs do not seek \ndamages based on actual injury for violations of 74 0 ILCS 14/15(b).  Instead, plaintiffs bring their \nlawsuit under 740 ILCS 14/15(c) that provides: “No private entity in possession of a biometric \nidentifier or biometric information may sell, lease,  trade, or otherwise profit from a person’s or a \n \n1 See Mutnick v. Clearview AI, Inc., et al ., 20-cv-0512. Case: 1:20-cv-03843 Document #: 37 Filed: 10/23/20 Page 1 of 4 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n customer’s biometric identifier or biometric inform ation.”  More specifically, Plaintiffs do not base \ntheir lawsuit on Clearview scraping their photog raphs from public sources, converting their \nphotographs into biometric facial scans, and disclo sing biometric facial scans, which would have \nrequired certain disclosures and plaintiffs’ consen t under BIPA § 15(b).  Rather, they are seeking \nonly statutory damages and attorney’s fees for the sale of their biometric information. Discussion  In their motion to remand, plaintiffs argue that the Court does not have subject matter \njurisdiction over their lawsuit based on the lack of Article III standing.  As the proponent of subject \nmatter jurisdiction, Clearview must establish: (1) pl aintiffs suffered an actual or imminent, concrete \nand particularized injury-in-fact; (2) a causal c onnection between the injury and the challenged \nconduct; and (3) the likelihood the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  Speech First, Inc. v. \nKilleen,  968 F.3d 628, 638 (7th Cir. 2020).  \n Plaintiffs argue that Clearview cannot establis h they suffered an injury-in-fact because “a \nbare procedural violation, divorced from any c oncrete harm,” does not “satisfy the injury-in-fact \nrequirement of Article III.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 136 S.Ct. 1540, 1549 (2016).  Plaintiffs point to a \nrecent Seventh Circuit decision discussing BIPA and Article III standing, see Bryant v. Compass Group \nUSA, Inc.,  958 F.3d 617, 621 (7th Cir. 2 020), to support their argument.   \n In Bryant , the Seventh Circuit considered whether the plaintiff had standing to bring claims \nunder §§ 15(a) and 15(b) of BIPA.  In doing so, the Bryant  court first held that the plaintiff had \nalleged sufficient factual details of a concrete, pa rticularized injury-in-fact satisfying Article III \nstanding concerning her § 15(b) claim based on defe ndant’s failure to make the required disclosures \nand failure to obtain plaintiff’s informed written consent before collecting her biometric data.  The \nSeventh Circuit concluded that by failing to comply with these requirements, defendant “inflicted \nthe concrete injury BIPA in tended to protect against, i.e. a consumer’s loss of the power and ability Case: 1:20-cv-03843 Document #: 37 Filed: 10/23/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n to make informed decisions about the collection, storage, and use of her biometric information.” Id. \nat 627.  As to plaintiff’s allegations under BIPA § 15(a), namely, that defendant failed to publicize a \ndata-retention policy and guidelines for destroyi ng biometric information, the Seventh Circuit \nconcluded this duty is not owed to the plaintiff, but to the general public.  Id. at 626.  The Bryant  \npanel thus concluded that plaintiff did not suffer a concrete or particularized injury-in-fact under § \n15(a).  Id.   \n With this guidance in mind, the Court’s inquiry is whether the present plaintiffs alleged Clearview’s sale of their biometric information under BIPA § 15(c) caused them a concrete, particularized harm, which is a fact-specific analysis.  See Diedrich v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC , 839 \nF.3d 583, 588 (7th Cir. 2016).  In their compla int, plaintiffs purposely narrowed their claim by \nsetting a class period from January 1, 2016 to Januar y 17, 2020, specifically stating that that the class \nmembers did not suffer any injury under § 15(c) “other than statutory aggrievement.”  Class members are citizens of Illinois and seek only statutory damages and attorney’s fees – not actual damages.  Plaintiffs’ § 15(c) allegations fit under BI PA’s statutory scheme, especially in light of the \nIllinois Supreme Court’s holding that “an individual need not allege some actual injury or adverse \neffect, beyond violation of his or her rights under the Act, in order to qualify as an ‘aggrieved’ person.”  Rosenbach v. Six Flags Enter. Corp., 129 N.E.3d 1197, 1207, 432 Ill. Dec. 654, 664 (Ill. 2019).  \n Despite Clearview’s arguments that plaintiffs  are attempting to manipulate their claims, as \nwith all lawsuits, a plaintiff is the master of her own complaint.  Plaintiffs purposely narrowed their \nclaim to the general prohibition of Clearview selling and profiting from plaintiffs’ biometric data and \nfiled their lawsuit in state court where such actions  are allowed without the constraints of Article III \nstanding .  Protect Our Parks, Inc. v. Chicago Park Dist. , 971 F.3d 722, 731 (7th Cir. 2020) (“Article III \ndoes not apply to the states, so ‘state courts are not bound by the limit ations of a case or Case: 1:20-cv-03843 Document #: 37 Filed: 10/23/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n \ncontroversy or other federal rules of  justiciability.’”) (citation omitted).  In the end, plaintiffs did not \nallege an injury-in-fact, and thus Clearview has failed to establish Article III standing. Conclusion  \n Based on the foregoing, the Court grants plaintiffs’ motion to remand to the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Divisi on.  [27]  Civil case terminated. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n Date: 10/23/2020        Entered: _____________________________          S H A R O N  J O H N S O N  C O L E M A N           United States District Judge \n   \n  Case: 1:20-cv-03843 Document #: 37 Filed: 10/23/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. Summary: Chuck Allen Hodge, a state pretrial detainee, filed a complaint against the United States, including a claim of sexual assault by artificial intelligence, under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, and the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this dismissal, considering the appeal frivolous and denying Hodge's motion to proceed in forma pauperis. The involvement of artificial intelligence was specifically in Hodge's claim of being sexually assaulted by AI, although the claim was found to be unsupported and did not fit within the FTCA's scope.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the district court had jurisdiction over Hodge's claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and whether Hodge had articulated a viable claim for relief.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that it lacked jurisdiction as Hodge's claims did not fall within the scope of the FTCA, meaning the United States retained sovereign immunity. The complaint failed to state a claim because it lacked specificity and facts to support any alleged negligent act by a federal employee. The appeal was dismissed as frivolous, and Hodge was denied in forma pauperis status.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation: Chuck Allen Hodge tried to sue the U.S. government because he claimed an AI \"assaulted\" him and he wasn't allowed to access legal materials while in jail. However, the law he used to sue requires the person being sued to have directly done something wrong, and they found no such action by the government. So, the court said it couldn't handle his case, his claims didn't make much sense, and he needed to pay the court fees.",

No. 1:23-CV-00195-SWS) \n(D. Wyo.) \n_________________________________ \nORDER AND JUDGMENT* \n_________________________________ \nBefore PHILLIPS , BRISCOE , and CARSON , Circuit Judges. \n_________________________________ \nChuck Allen Hodge, a stat e pretrial detainee proceeding pro se, appeals \nthe district court’s order dismissing his complaint for lack of jurisdiction and \nfor failure to state a claim. He also s eeks leave from us to  proceed in forma \npauperis (IFP) on appeal. Exercising ju risdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we \ndismiss the appeal as frivolous and deny his motion to proceed IFP. \n \n \n* After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has \ndetermined unanimously that  oral argument would not materially assist in the \ndetermination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)( 2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). \nThe case is therefore orde red submitted without oral argument. This order and \njudgment is not binding precedent, exce pt under the doctrines of law of the \ncase, res judicata, and collateral estopp el. It may be cited, however, for its \npersuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. FILED \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nTenth Circuit \n \nApril 24, 2024  \n \nChristopher M. Wolpert \nClerk of Court  Appellate Case: 23-8088     Document: 010111037290     Date Filed: 04/24/2024     Page: 1 2 \n  \nBACKGROUND  \n In the district court, Hodge filed a complaint against the United States. \nThough the district court noted th at Hodge’s “complaint borders on \nincomprehensible,” the co urt understood him to adva nce two claims under the \nFederal Tort Claims Act,  28 U.S.C. § 1346: (1) depr ivation of access to a law \nlibrary and law books, and (2) sexual  assault by artificial intelligence.1 R. vol. \n1, at 154. Screening the complaint unde r 28 U.S.C. § 1915A, the district court \nruled that it lacked jurisdiction becaus e Hodge’s claims didn’t fit under the \nFTCA, leaving the United States immune. So the court dismissed Hodge’s \ncomplaint for lack of  subject-matter jurisdiction and also “for failure to comply \nwith [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 8( a)’s pleading requirements.” R. vol. 1, \nat 160. Hodge appealed.2 \n \n1 The court also observed that Hodg e’s complaint “makes several other \nallegations,” including “t hat his right to a fair and speedy trial has been \nviolated, that he was not read his Miranda  rights when he was arrested, and that \nhe is being tortured.” R. vol. 1, at 155. The court declined  to address these \nallegations because they were “simply too concluso ry, vague, and unsupported \nby any facts to satisfy th e low hurdle of Rule (8)(a )’s pleading standard.” Id. at \n156. We agree.  \n \n2 After entering the order dismissing Hodge’s complaint, the district court \nfailed to enter a judgment on a separate document, as Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 58(a) requires. And because th e district court had not yet entered a \njudgment before Hodge filed his notice of appeal, his appeal was premature. \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2). But we have de cided that this type of prematurity is \ncured by Federal Rule of Appellate Proced ure 4(a)(7)(B) because “the appellant \ncan always decide to waive the separate  document requirem ent and choose to \n(footnote continued ) Appellate Case: 23-8088     Document: 010111037290     Date Filed: 04/24/2024     Page: 2 3 \n STANDARD OF REVIEW  \n We review de novo the district cour t’s dismissal on sovereign-immunity \ngrounds. Flute v. United States , 808 F.3d 1234, 12 39 (10th Cir. 2015).  \nDISCUSSION  \n “The United States and its officers enjoy immunity from suit except in \ninstances where the United States has expressly waived that protection.” Id. \nAnd unless the United Stat es waives its immunity, “the federal courts lack \njurisdiction to hear claims against it.” San Juan Cnty. v. United States , 754 \nF.3d 787, 792 (10th Cir. 2014).  \n Under the FTCA, the United States waived its sovereign immunity—and \nconsented to be sued—for “torts  committed by federal employees.” F.D.I.C. v. \nMeyer , 510 U.S. 471, 475–76 (1994) (citin g 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)). The FTCA \ncovers claims (1) against the United Stat es; (2) for money da mages; (3) due to \nan injury, death, or loss of property; (4) caused by a neglig ent act by a United \nStates employee; (5) w ho was acting within the scope of his employment; \n(6) “under [the] circumstances where th e United States, if a private person, \nwould be liable to the claimant.” Id. at 477 (quoting sa me). Given this, Hodge \nhas not stated a claim under  the FTCA: Though  he purports to sue the United \nStates, he has identified no  negligent act by a United  States employee. Indeed, \n \nappeal prior to the runn ing of the 150-day cap.” Constein v. United States , 628 \nF.3d 1207, 1212 (10th Cir. 2010) (cleaned up). Thus, we have jurisdiction over \nHodge’s appeal. Appellate Case: 23-8088     Document: 010111037290     Date Filed: 04/24/2024     Page: 3 4 \n he is a state detainee being held in a state jail. Thus, the United States is \nimmune, and the district court correctly  dismissed Hodge’s complaint for lack \nof jurisdiction.  \n Likewise, Hodge is not entitled to IFP status. We grant IFP motions when \nappellants show (1) “a financial inability to pay the required  filing fees” and \n(2) “the existence of a reasoned, nonfrivo lous argument on th e law and facts in \nsupport of the issues  raised on appeal.” Watkins v. Leyba , 543 F.3d 624, 627 \n(10th Cir. 2008) (cleaned up). Hodge’s opening brief, which is sparse and \nconclusory, fails to  challenge the district court’s ruling on subject-matter \njurisdiction. We thus conclude that hi s arguments on appeal are frivolous and \ndeny his motion to proceed IFP. See id. Hodge must pay the appellate-filing fee \nimmediately. See 10th Cir. R. 3.3.  \nCONCLUSION  \n For all these reasons, we dismiss this appeal as frivolous and deny Hodge IFP \nstatus. \nEntered for the Court \n  Gregory A.

The court granted McComb the opportunity to file a second amended complaint because his initial amended complaint did not comply with procedural rules regarding length and clarity. Although the case does not directly involve AI in its primary claims, the court explicitly prohibits the use of AI in preparing any filings and requires McComb to confirm non-use of AI in his case filings by affidavit.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the plaintiff's complaint satisfies the basic pleading requirements under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), which mandates a short and plain statement of the claim.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court granted the plaintiff leave to file a second amended complaint that complies with procedural rules by a set deadline; simultaneously, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss without prejudice. Additionally, the plaintiff must submit an affidavit affirming that AI was not used to prepare case filings.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: A person named Robert McComb says he was treated unfairly by Best Buy because of his race and disability. The court told him to rewrite his complaint because it was too long and confusing. The court also told him he cannot use computer programs or \"AI\" to help write his legal papers, and he must confirm this by signing a paper called an affidavit.",

On December 19, 2023, the Court granted \nPlaintiff leave to file an amended complaint.  Doc. No. 19.  The Court specified that the amended \ncomplaint shall not exceed 20 pages and shall comply with Federal R ule of Civil Proceudre 8(a).  \nDoc. No. 19 at PageID 531.  The case is before the Court on Plaintiff’s proposed amended \ncomplaint  (Doc. No. 20) and Defendants’ motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 21).   \nFirst, Plaintiff failed to comply with the Court’s O rder because the proposed amended \ncomplaint is 29 pages.  Doc. No. 20.   \n \n1 Plaintiff’s initial complaint identifies Best Buy, Inc. as a Defendant.  Defendant clarified that the correct \nname is Best Buy Stores, LP .  Doc. No. 5 at PageID 157.

No. 20) , and liberally construing it in pro se Plaintiff’s favor,2 the Court continues to \nquestion whether Plaintiff ’s amended complaint  satisfies  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a).  \nRule  8(a) requires that “‘[a] pleading that states a claim for relief must  contain,’  among other \nthings, ‘a shor t and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief. ’”  \nKensu v. Corizon, Inc., 5 F.4th 646, 649 (6th Cir. 2021) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  A \ncomplaint violates Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) if “[it]  is so ‘verbose, confused and redundant that its true \nsubstance, if any, is well disguise d.’”  Id.  (quoting Gillibeau v. City of Richmond, 417 F.2d 426, \n431 (9th Cir. 1969)).   \nAccordingly, Plaintiff is GRANTED leave to file  a second  amended complaint  by \nJanuary 23, 2024.  The amended complaint shall not exceed 20 pages  and shall comply with F. \nR. Civ. P. 8(a) .  Plaintiff is ADVISED that if he fails to timely file a  second  amended complaint \nin accordance with this Order, the Court may dismiss his complaint with prejudice and terminate \nthis case on the docket.  See Kensu , 5 F.4th at 652–53.      \nAdditionally , Plaintiff shall file an affidavit by January 23, 2024 verifying that he has not \nused Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to prepare case filings.  The Court reminds all parties that they are not allowed to use AI —for any purpose —to prepare any filings in the instant case or any case \nbefore the undersigned.  See Judge Newman’s Civil Standing Order at VI .  Both parties, and their \nrespective counsel, have an obligation to immediately inform the Court if they discover that a party has used AI to prepare any fili ng.  Id.

In early 2021, Pinterest began to implement the \nspecial committee’s reforms (Dkt. No. 107).  These lawsuits were consolidated in a series of \norders issued between December 2020 and July 2021 (Dkt. Nos. 28, 39, 49, 86).  The parties \nreached a settlement in November 2021 (Dkt. No. 99).  The settlement provided incremental \nreforms beyond those provided by the special committee.  Preliminary approval was given in \nFebruary 2022 (Dkt. No. 115).   Final approval of the settlement was granted in June 2022 (Dkt. \nNo. 134) along with an award of $2,500,000  in attorney’s fees.

For \nexample, by June 2023, there was an increase in women represented in leadership positions \nfrom 33% to 40% (Dkt. No. 141).

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of *Virtual Radiologic Corporation (vRad) v. Michael Rabern*, vRad sought a preliminary injunction against former employee Michael Rabern, who left to work for a competing company, Nines, Inc. vRad claimed Rabern breached non-compete and non-solicitation agreements, and alleged misappropriation of confidential information and trade secrets. The Minnesota District Court denied the injunction, finding vRad unlikely to succeed on claims of breach of contract or misappropriation due to insufficient evidence of irreparable harm or fraud.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue was whether Michael Rabern breached the non-compete and confidentiality agreements with vRad by misrepresenting Nines' business activities and potentially misappropriating trade secrets, warranting a preliminary injunction.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that vRad failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims or a threat of irreparable harm. Consequently, the court denied the request for a preliminary injunction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a rule that says you can't join a new soccer team for a year after leaving your old team. Rabern, a player, promises his old team (vRad) that his new team (Nines) doesn't compete with them. vRad believes him and changes the rule to make it easier for him.

  \nBut that is not the entire record.  Perhaps the best evidence  about what Rabern\nsaid to vRad to persuade  it to amend his agreement  is the amendment  itself.  And the\namendment  provides  more support to Rabern’s  version of events than to vRad’s.  \nvRad has insisted that the original non‐compete  provision  only restricted  Rabern\nfrom working  for companies  that compete  with vRad—that  is, companies  that are\ninvolved  in teleradiology.7  See ECF No. 7 at 10‐11, 22.  According  to vRad, Rabern\nexplicitly  told vRad that Nines would not be involved  in teleradiology.   If that were\ntrue, however,  then Rabern would not need to request—and  vRad would not need to\n6Rabern claims that he told his direct supervisor

 who had assured it that nothing that\nhe would be doing would violate the non‐compete.\nvRad says that Rabern asked vRad to confirm that Rabern’s  employment  would\nnot violate his non‐compete.   Such requests from departing  employees  are not\nuncommon.   Typically,  the old employer  will ask for written assurances  from the new\nemployer  about the scope of the departing  employee’s

 is void on a\nfraudulent ‐inducement  theory.  And because vRad has acknowledged  that Rabern’s\nemployment  with Nines does not violate the agreement  as amended , the failure of vRad’s\nfraudulent

  The Court does not doubt that the manner in which a party selects,\norganizes,  and displays public information  can qualify as a trade secret.  But having\nreviewed  the screenshots  and listened to Werb struggle while testifying  at the hearing\nto identify what about the screenshots  was confidential,  the Court concludes  that it is\nunlikely that vRad will be able to convince

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Raymond Long, M.D., and Bandha Yoga Publications, LLC, against Facebook, Inc. The plaintiffs alleged that a hacker gained unauthorized access to their Facebook page and posted links and images of their copyrighted material. The court granted Facebook's motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' second amended complaint, citing that the plaintiffs failed to establish Facebook's actual knowledge of the infringing content or to present new communications showing specific infringement on Facebook. AI or automated systems were mentioned in the context of Facebook potentially using scraping and neural network software to detect infringing material, but this did not establish actual knowledge of infringement.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff adequately alleged that Facebook had actual knowledge of the specific infringing material, which is necessary to establish a contributory copyright infringement claim.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiffs failed to cure the defects in their allegations, particularly the lack of Facebook's actual knowledge of the infringing content on their platform. As such, the contributory infringement claim did not meet the necessary legal standard, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act's (DMCA) safe harbor protection applied to Facebook. Thus, the case was dismissed with prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you post your own drawings on your social media account, and someone else hacks into your account and starts sharing them secretly. You tell the social media company (let's call it \"Friendsite\") about it. The court here is deciding if you gave enough proof that Friendsite knew exactly what stolen drawings were being posted. The court said you didn't show \"Friendsite\" knew, even with all their fancy AI tools. So, the case against Friendsite is closed, saying Friendsite acted quick enough to remove the suspected bad posts once you finally flagged them.",

No. 75 \n \nBefore the court is defendant Facebook, Inc.’s (“defendant”)  motion to dismiss \nplaintiff s Raymon d Long, M.D. ’s (“Long”) and Bandha Yoga Publications, LLC ’s \n(“Bandha”) (collectively, “plaintiff”) second  amended complaint  (“SAC”) .  Dkt. 75.  H aving \nread the parties’ papers and considered their argument and the relevant legal authority, \nand good cause appearing, the court hereby GRANTS  defendant’s motion to dismiss.  \nBACKGROUND  \nThis lawsuit is a copyright infringement action brought by plaintiff against \ndefendant and unspecified Doe defendants.  It arises out of a hacker’s illicit access to \nand control of plaintiff’s Facebook page.   While in control, the hacker posted on the page \nvarious links and images related to plaintiff’s copyrighted material .  The parties are \nfamiliar with the events giving rise to this action.  They are also familiar with its procedural \nposture.  The court will detail its  background only as necessary below.  \nDISCUSSION  \nIn its first amended complaint (“FAC”), plaintiff alleged  seven claims against \ndefendant.  Dkt. 27 (FAC) ¶¶ 102 -126 (direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright \ninfringement), ¶¶ 167 -71 (negligence), ¶¶ 172 -74 (aiding and abetting), ¶¶ 175 -80 Case 4:17-cv-02758-PJH   Document 84   Filed 09/17/21   Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (breach of contract), ¶¶ 181 -84 (violation of Business & Professions  Code § 17200).  For \npurposes of this order, the court need address only one of the three copyright claims \nalleged in the FAC —namely, the contributory infringement claim.  Id. ¶¶ 109 -16. \nOn February 22, 2019, the court dismissed that claim  with prejudice.  Dkt. 45 at \n10.  Aside from a footnote, id. at 10 n.7, t he court did not address  whether plaintiff stated \na prima facie claim for contributory infringement.  The court did not decide whether \nplaintiff identified communications  that it sent  to defendant tha t complied with any take \ndown notice  conditions required by the  Digital Millennium Copyright Act ’s (“DMCA”), Title \n17 U.S.C. § 512.   Instead,  the court found that, “regardless of whether plaintiff sent \nnotices that complied with the  DMCA’s requirements,” id. at 7, defendant expeditiously \nremoved  any infringing material, id. at 9-10.  Based on that finding, the court held that the \nDMCA’s safe harbor applies to the contributory infringement  claim .  Id. at 10.  Plaintiff \nappealed.  Dkt. 63.  \nOn April 23, 2021,  the Ninth Circuit issued a memorandum disposition.  Dkt. 65.  \nThe panel affirmed the court’s dismissal of the contributory infringement claim. Id. at 4.  It \nheld that plaintiff “fail[ed] to plausibly establish that [defendant] actually knew precisely \nwhat  infringing material was available on Facebook.”  Id.  The panel based that holding \non the FAC’s allegations, the parties’ communications, and the attachments to such \ncommunications.  Id.1   \nHowever, the panel then observed that “[t] his defect could theor etically, however, \nbe cured by the allegation of other facts. ”  Id. (internal quotes and citations omitted).  As a \n \n1 In its opposition, plaintiff states that “[n]othing in the [panel’s] opinion suggests that the \nPanel construed the FAC as alleging that infringing images were posted directly on the \nBandha  Yoga page that Facebook had the right and ability to control.”  Dk t. 80 at 17.  \nThat statement shows that plaintiff misunderstands the panel’s decision.  Dkt. 65 at 2 \n(“[Plaintiff] contacted [defendant] , and after eight days of email communications, \n[defendant]  revoked [the hacker’s]  administrator access, an action that automatically \ndeleted all of  [the hacker’s]  posts , including those that contained  or linked to \ninfringing material .”) (emphasis added).   \n \nAdditionally, contrary to plaintiff’s characterization of that decision as “non -precedential,” \nDkt. 80 at 17, that de cision may qualify as precedential under the law of the case  \ndoctrine .  See Ninth Cir. R. 36 -3(a). Case 4:17-cv-02758-PJH   Document 84   Filed 09/17/21   Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  primary example,  the panel indicated that “if [plaintiff]  could plead facts describing a \ndifferent communication to Facebook that clearly ide ntified a set of specific infringing \nimages on Facebook and, at the same time, clearly indicated his ownership of those  \nspecific images, he could state a prima facie claim for contributory infringement,  and the \nburden would then shift to Facebook to prove any affirmative defenses. ”  Id. at 4-5.   \nThe panel then “note[d] that amendment would not necessarily be futile.”  Id. at 5.  \nThe panel  explained that,  “[b]ecause an Amended Complaint may plea d new facts \ninforming both whether [plaintiff’s] communications satisfied [Title 17 U.S.C.] § \n512(c)(3)(A) and whether, if so, [defendant’s] response was expeditious,” this  court’s \nholding  in its February 22, 2019 order  (that the DMCA ’s safe harbor applies) “does not \nprovide an independent alternative gr ound for dismissal with prejudice.”  Id.  The panel \nthen directed this court to permit plaintiff leave to amend.  Id.  This court did so.  Dkt. 67.  \nOn July 1, 2021, plaintiff filed its operative second amended complaint.  Dkt. 70 .  \nOn July 29, 2021, defend ant filed the instant  motion to dismiss.  Dkt. 75.  In it, defendant \nproffers two  arguments.  First, defendant asserts that plaintiff failed to remedy the actual \nknowledge defects identified by the panel as necessary to state a prima facie claim for \ncontri butory infringement.  Second, defendant argues that the DMCA safe harbor applies.  \nBased on the panel’s instructions,  it appears  that the main question  to determine \nthe viability of the contrib utory infringement claim  is whether the SAC alleges a “ different \ncommunication to defendant ” that “clearly identified a set of specific infringing images on \nFacebook ” and “at the same time, clearly indicated his ownership of those specific \nimage .”   \nThe co urt finds that t he SAC does not.  The court closely reviewed th at amended \npleading  and compared it to the FAC.  It also tediously tallied all communications.  In his \nSAC,  plaintiff specifies  only the same  communications alleged in h is FAC.2  Given that,  \n \n2 Compare  SAC ¶¶ 45 -49 (May 24, 2015 emails and May 24, 2015 and May 25, 2015 \nintellectual property (“IP”) reporting forms) with FAC ¶¶ 42 -46 (same); Compare  SAC ¶ \n52 (May 25, 2015 email using account associated with plaintiff’s Facebook business \npage) with FAC ¶ 51 (same); Compare  SAC ¶¶ 60 -61 (more May 25, 2015 emails) with Case 4:17-cv-02758-PJH   Document 84   Filed 09/17/21   Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  plaintiff necessarily failed to identify any new, different communication s by it to defendant \nestablishing that defendant had actual knowledge of the specific infringing material.    \nThat said, the  court notes that the panel’s  observation about amendment was \nillustrative of the sort of  new facts that plaintiff could allege to satisfy the actual \nknowledge element necessary to state a prima face contributory infringement claim.   Dkt. \n65 at 4 (“ For ins tance , if [plaintiff]  could plead facts describing a different  communication  \n. . .”) (emphasis added).   Thus, the court understands that plaintiff may nonetheless show \nthat element by other facts that do not necessarily involve different communications.  \nIn its opposition, plaintiff suggests that its  newly added allegation s at paragraph 59 \nsatisfy  that element .  Dkt. 80 at 26-27.  In particular, plaintiff argues that:  \nContrary to Facebook’s claim that [plaintiff]  did not tell \n[defendant]  “precisely what infringing material was available on \n[defendant] ,” . . .  [plaintiff]  specifically pleads that “ [defendant]  \nwas aware from  [plaintiff’s]  DMCA notices that everything \nthe [hacker]  posted on [plaintiff’s]  Bandha Yoga Facebook \npage was copyri ghted by [plaintiff]  and all that material  \ninfringed on [plaintiff] ’s copyrights.”  Id. at 26 (emphasis in \nthe original).  \nTo support the portion quoted in bold, plaintiff primarily cites SAC para graph 59(a).  \nIn that paragraph, plaintiff alleges ( on inform ation and belief ) that defendant maintains \ncertain website “scraping” software that enables defendant to  identify “‘new’ material \nposted onto a website after a specific date.”  SAC ¶ 59(a) ; see also Id. ¶ 59(b) \n(substantially similar assertion).   Plaintiff  also parenthetically cites paragraph 59(e) .  Dkt. \n80 at 26 -27.  In that paragraph, plaintiff asserts  that h e “specifically identified the \ninfringing images ” and “supplied a link to his blog showing the ‘source’ of the improperly \ncopied infringing material .”  SAC ¶ 59(e).   Plaintiff further alleges (on information and \n \nFAC ¶¶ 57 -58 (same); Compare  SAC ¶¶ 68 -71 (May 26, 2015 communications) with \nFAC ¶ 67 -70 (same); Compare  SAC ¶¶ 74, 77 -78 (May 27, 2015 communications) with \nFAC ¶ 72, 75 -76 (same); Compare  SAC ¶ 81 (May 28, 2015 notices and \ncommunications) with FAC ¶ 78 (same);  Compare  SAC ¶¶ 83 -86 (May 29, 2015 \ncommunications) with FAC ¶¶ 80 -83 (same); Compare  SAC ¶ 88 (May 30, 2015 notices) \nwith FAC ¶ 84 (same); Compare  SAC ¶ 89 (June 1, 2015 response) with FAC ¶ 85 \n(same); see also  Dkt. 70 -1 (redline comparing SAC to FAC).   Case 4:17-cv-02758-PJH   Document 84   Filed 09/17/21   Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  belief) that defendant has certain “neural network and artificial intelligence” software that \npermits it to identify and remove potentially infringing material.  Id. \nWhen ru ling on a motion to dismiss, the court does not consider conclusions.  It \nconsiders only  facts.   For that reason, the court disregards paragraph 59(e)’s first \nassertion that he “specifically identified” the infringing material.   \nAfter applying that basic  principle to  the above paragraphs , the court finds that \ntheir remaining factual allegations  fail to plausibly establish that defendant had actual \nknowledge of the specific infringing material.  At best,  paragraph s 59(a)’s and 59(e)’s \nunverified  assertion s about defendant’s use of “scraping ” or other “artificial intelligence”  \nsoftware supports the inference that defendant could  become aware of all information \nposted.  That inference does not establish “actual knowledge” (or “awareness,” however \nput).  It als o says nothing about defendant’s mental state as it pertains to “precisely what \ninfringing material was available on Facebook .”  Dkt. 65 at 4  (emphasis added) .   \nThat leaves paragraph 59(e)’s second assertion that  plaintiff  sent defendant a link \nto his blo g.  Plaintiff does not make any attempt to show that such communication was \nany different than those already enumerated, considered, and rejected in his FAC.  \nRegardless, even  if plaintiff had , defendant’s receipt of a  “link” to a blog does not show \nactual  knowledge of any specific infringing material posted on Facebook . \nFinally, the court observes that the SAC includes one other allegation  related to \nthe knowledge element.  That allegation  appear s at paragraph 55.  Plaintiff fails to cite \nthat allegation in support of its position on the knowledge  issue .  To provide this action \nsome long -awaited repose, the court will  address it . \nAt paragraph 55, plaintiff alleges that defendant’s May 25, 2015 at 1 2:28 am \ncommunication to plaintiff (first referenced at SAC ¶ 54) shows that defendant \n“acknowledge[ed] receipt” of plaintiff’s communications and, thus, “was aware” of \nplaintiff’s purported take down notices.  SAC ¶ 55.  Perhaps.  But plaintiff’s allegati on at \nparagraph 55 is a new argument,  not a new fact.  In its FAC, plaintiff identifies that exact \nsame communication.  Compare  FAC ¶ 53.  Thus, the court finds that paragraph 55 does Case 4:17-cv-02758-PJH   Document 84   Filed 09/17/21   Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  nothing to cure the actual knowledge defect identified by the  panel  in its decision . \nIn short, the court concludes that plaintiff failed to cure the actual knowledge \ndefects identified by the panel .  As a result, the panel’s conclusion that plaintiff failed to \nstate a prima facie claim for contributory infringement remains con trolling.  Separately, \nbecause  plaintiff  has failed to allege any additional facts in the SAC that would alter this \ncourt ’s Februar y 22, 2019 holding that defendant  expediti ously removed any infringing \nmaterial,  the court further concludes that the DMCA safe harbor defense  still applies.    \nCONCLUSION  \n For the above reasons, the court GRANTS  defendant’s motion to dismiss plaintiff ’s \nsecond amended complaint.  The panel permitted plaintiff the opportunity to amend the \ncontributory infringement claim.  The panel clearly instructed plaintiff how it may cure that \nclaim’s defects.  Plaintiff failed to remedy such defects.  On that basis , the court finds \npermitting plaintiff further leave to amend this claim would be futile.  Accordingly, the \ncourt dismisses this claim with prejudice.  Given that, the court notes that all of plaintiff’s \nclaims in this action have been finally adjudicated (at least in this court).   \nThe court will again enter judgment.  \n IT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  September 17, 2021  \nPhyllis J.

See generally IFP App.  He  briefly, and broadly, contends \nthat he “has no income, no assets, and no means of financial support,”  id. at 1, and while the Court \ntakes him at his word, he nonetheless fails to provide any specific details regarding his financial \ncircumstances as required, leaving the Court without enough information to assess his current financial circumstances.

Plaintiff’s Complaint fares no better. The Court notes that Plaintiff has failed to provide an \naddress or any contact information apart from his email address, thus contravening D.C.

The allegations consist  of ruminations \nabout Plaintiff’s fear arising from  the development of advanced artificial intelligence, interspersed \nwith quotations, esoteric references, and fantastical concerns about the end of mankind.  See id. at \n2–7.  Like his IFP Application, it is also unsigned, see Fed. R. Civ.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Lindsay Spilsbury, acting pro se, filed a civil rights complaint alleging that the defendants used artificial intelligence and other technologies to harass her and sell her identity online. The court dismissed the case without prejudice due to the lack of jurisdiction, as it fell under state court proceedings highlighted by the Younger and Rooker-Feldman doctrines. The case involves AI in the claims where the plaintiff accuses the defendants of utilizing AI for harassment and identity exploitation.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the federal court has jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's claims of civil rights violations given ongoing or decided state court proceedings and the lack of a sufficient claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction based on the Younger and Rooker-Feldman doctrines, as the matters could be or were being addressed in state court, and for failing to comply with a court order to address these jurisdictional issues. Additionally, the court considered imposing filing restrictions on the plaintiff due to repeated improper filings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: This case is about someone who believed they were being harassed using high-tech methods and filed a lawsuit about it. However, the court said that they should actually be dealing with this at a different court (state court) and thus dismissed the case. The person had previously made similar claims that didn’t work out, and because of so many filings without proper grounds, the court is thinking about putting rules in place to stop them from filing more cases without proper procedures.",

No. 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS CARICE DEMCHOK, \nSETH DEMCHOK, VERA DEMCHOK, PAT DEMCHOK and ANDREW DEMCHOK, \n  Defendants. \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER OF DISMISSAL \nAND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \n \n Pro se  Plaintiff filed her Complaint using the form “Civil Rights Complaint Pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1983.”  Doc. 1, filed July 9, 2025 (“Comp laint”).  Where the Co mplaint form prompts \nplaintiffs to indicate whether de fendants were acting under color of state law, Plaintiff marked the \n“Yes” box.  See Complaint at 1, 3.

See Order to Show Cause at 4.  Judge \nSweazea also ordered Plaintiff to file an amended complaint.  See Order to Show Cause at 4 (stating \nPlaintiff must identify e ach case in state court dealing with th e same facts involved in this action \nincluding the name of th e courts and the case numbers and mu st indicate whether the state court \nproceeding is ongoing, has been dismissed and whet her Plaintiff has appealed any final judgment \nin the state cour t proceeding).   \nThe Court dismisses this case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to \ncomply with the Order to Show Cause.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (“If the court determines at \nany time that it lacks subject-mat ter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action”).  Judge \nSweazea notified Plaintiff she bears the burden of alle ging facts that support jurisdiction and that \nfailure to comply with Court Orders may result in sanctions including filing restrictions and \ndismissal of this case.  See Order to Show Cause at 4-5 (quoti ng Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) (“If the \nplaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with thes e rules or a court order, a defendant may move to \ndismiss the action”); Gustafson v.

Plaintiff did not file a respons e showing cause why the Court \nshould not dismiss this case fo r lack of jurisdiction by the A ugust 28, 2025, deadline.  Although \nPlaintiff timely filed an Amended Complaint, it  does not show why the C ourt should not dismiss \nthis case for lack of jurisdiction due to the proceedings in state c ourt; nor does it identify the state \ncourt case numbers and the disposition of each case.  See Amended Complaint for Violation of \nCivil Rights, Doc. 6, filed Augus t 25, 2025 (alleging Defendants “dep loyed artificial intelligence \ntechnologies to direct continuous verbal a buse, body-focused harassment, and psychological \ntorment at Plaintiff” and “maint ain[ed] a continuous electronic ‘frequency’ connection targeting \nPlaintiff’s body and mind . . .[which] causes phys ical vibration, foul odors, pain, and severe \nemotional distress”).   Plaintiff also filed a Motion for Prelimin ary Emergency Injunction “to prevent further \nirreparable harm pending resolution of the underlying civil rights complaint” and, among other \nthings, “prohibiting Defendant Vera Demchok from continuing frequency-based targeting and \nharassment of Plaintiff.”  Do c. 7, filed August 29, 2025.  The Cour t denies Plaintiff’s Motion for \nPreliminary Emergency Injunction because the C ourt is dismissing this case for lack of \njurisdiction. \nORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \nPlaintiff has filed five cases in this Cour t asserting claims against Defendant Vera \nDemchok.  See Spilsbury v. Demchok , No. 2:25cv00646-KWR-KRS (this case; dismissed for lack \nof jurisdiction and for failure to comply with the Court’s Order to Show Cause); Spilsbury v. \nDemchok , No. 2:24cv01043-DHU-JHR (dismissed for failur e to state a claim and for failure to \ncomply with the Court’s Order to Show Cause); Spilsbury v. Demchok , No. 2:24cv00404-MV-JHR \n(dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to  comply with the Court’s Order to Show Cause); Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 3 of 74 \n Spilsbury v. Demchok , No. 2:24cv00045-MIS-GJF (dismissed for failure to state a claim and for \nfailure to comply with the C ourt’s Order to Show Cause); Spilsbury v. Demchok , No. 2:23cv00917-\nKWR-GBW (dismissed for fail ure to state a claim). \nPlaintiff has repeatedly filed complaints that fa iled to state a claim or failed to show the \nCourt had jurisdiction over her claims and has repeat edly failed to comply with the Court’s Orders \nto Show Cause.  The Court finds that filing restri ctions are appropriate so  that the Court does not \nexpend valuable resources addressing future such filings and orders Plaintiff to show cause why \nthe Court should not impo se filing restrictions. \nCourt’s Power to Impose Filing Restrictions   The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has discussed the Court’s power \nto impose filing restrictions and the pr ocedure for imposing filing restrictions: \n“[T]he right of access to the courts is neither absolute  nor unconditional and there \nis no constitutional right of access to the courts to prosecute an action that is \nfrivolous or malicious.” Tripati v. Beaman,  878 F.2d 351, 353 (10th Cir.1989) (per \ncuriam) (citation omitted). “There is str ong precedent establis hing the inherent \npower of federal courts to regulate the activities of abusive litigants by imposing \ncarefully tailored restrictions unde r the appropriate circumstances.” Cotner v. \nHopkins,  795 F.2d 900, 902 (10th Cir.1986). “E ven onerous conditions may be \nimposed upon a litigant as long as they are de signed to assist the ... court in curbing \nthe particular abusive be havior involved,” except th at they “cannot be so \nburdensome ... as to deny a litigant meaningful access to the courts.” Id. (brackets \nand internal quotation marks omitted). “Litigiousness alone will not support an \ninjunction restricting filing activities. However, injunc tions are proper where the \nlitigant's abusive and lengthy history is properly set forth.” Tripati,  878 F.2d at 353 \n(citations omitted). “[T]here must be some guidelines as to what [a party] must do to obtain the court's permi ssion to file an action.” Id. at 354. “In additi on, [the party] \nis entitled to notice and an  opportunity to oppose the co urt's order before it is \ninstituted.” Id. A hearing is not required; a wr itten opportunity to respond is \nsufficient. See id.  \n \nLandrith v. Schmidt , 732 F.3d 1171, 1174 (10th Cir. 2013).   \nProposed Filing Restrictions  \n The Court proposes to impose the follo wing filing restrictions on Plaintiff: Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 4 of 75 \n  Plaintiff will be enjoined from making further fi lings in this case exce pt objections to this \norder, a notice of appeal and a moti on for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis ; and the \nClerk will be directed to not fi le any additional submissions by Plai ntiff in this case other than \nobjections to this order, a notice of appeal , or a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma \npauperis,  unless a licensed attorney who is admitted to practice before this Court and has appeared \nin this action signs the proposed filing.    Plaintiff also will be enjoin ed from initiating future litigati on in this Court and the Clerk \nwill be directed to not file a ny initial pleading that Plaintiff submits, unless either a licensed \nattorney who is admitted to practice before this Court signs the pleading or Plaintiff first obtains \npermission to proceed pro se .  See DePineda v. Hemphill , 34 F.3d 946, 948-49 (10th Cir. 1994). \nTo obtain permission to proceed pro se  in this Court, Plaintiff must take the following steps: \n1. File with the Clerk of Court a petition requesting leave to file a pro se initial pleading, a \nnotarized affidavit, the proposed initial plea ding, and a copy of thes e filing restrictions; \n2. The affidavit must be notarized, be in proper le gal form and recite the claims that Plaintiff \nseeks to present, including a short discussion of th e legal bases for the claims, and the basis of the \nCourt’s jurisdiction of the subject matter and parties.  The affidavit must certify that, to the best of \nPlaintiff’s knowledge, Plaintiff's claims are not frivolous or made  in bad faith; that they are \nwarranted by existing law or a good faith argument for th e extension, mo dification, or reversal of \nexisting law; that the new suit is not initiated fo r any improper purpose su ch as delay or needless \nincrease in the cost of litigation; and that Plai ntiff will comply with all Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure and the District of New Mexico’s Local Rules of Civil Procedure.  If Plaintiff’s claims \nhave previously been ra ised or Plaintiff has previously sued the defendants, the affidavit must Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 5 of 76 \n certify that the proposed new suit doe s not present the same claims th at this or any other court has \ndecided and explain why the new suit w ould not be an abuse of the system; \n3.  The Clerk of the Court shal l open a new civil case, file th e petition, the affidavit, the \nproposed pleading and the copy of these restricti ons in the new civil cas e, and randomly assign a \nMagistrate Judge to determine whether to  grant Plaintiff’s petition to proceed pro se  in the new \ncivil case.  See Mem. Op. and Order, Doc. 21 at 6-9, filed in In re Billy L. Edwards , No. 15cv631 \nMCA/SMV (D.N.M. November 13, 2015) (adopting procedure, similar to that of the Tenth Circuit, \nof opening a new case and filing the rest ricted filer’s petition to proceed pro se ).  If the Magistrate \nJudge approves Plaintiff’s petition to proceed pro se , the Magistrate Judge shall enter an order \nindicating that the matter shall proceed in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nand the District of New Mexico’s  Local Rules of Civil Procedure.   If the Magistrate Judge does \nnot approve Plaintiff’s petition to proceed pro se , the Magistrate Judge shall instruct the Clerk to \nassign a District Judge to the new case.  \n IT IS ORDERED that: \n(i) This case is DISMISSED without prejudice.  \n(ii) Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Em ergency Injunction, Doc. 7, filed August 29, \n2025, is DENIED.  \n(iii) Within fourteen (14) days from entry of  this Order, Plaintiff shall show cause why \nthis Court should not enter the proposed  filing restrictions described above. \nPlaintiff’s written objections to the proposed  filing restrictions shall be limited to \n10 pages.  If Plaintiff does not timely file objections, the proposed filing restrictions \nshall take effect fourteen (14) days from th e date of this order and will apply to any Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 6 of 77 \n matter filed after that time.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Six Illinois residents filed a class action lawsuit against HireVue, Inc., alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) for capturing their biometric data during job interviews using HireVue's AI-powered software. The court partially granted and partially denied HireVue's motion to dismiss, upholding specific personal jurisdiction and claims under several sections of BIPA, but dismissing claims under § 15(c) that related to profiting from biometric data without adequate allegations of individual harm or direct profit from the data itself.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether HireVue's AI-driven collection and use of biometric data from job applicants violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), and whether the Illinois court has specific personal jurisdiction over HireVue.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it could exercise specific personal jurisdiction over HireVue because the company purposefully availed itself of the Illinois market by providing its AI software to an Illinois-based company. The motion to dismiss claims for lack of personal jurisdiction was denied, but the motion was granted in part for failure to state a claim under § 15(c) of BIPA regarding profiting from biometric data, while other claims were allowed to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you used a fancy computer program for a video job interview that analyzed your face to decide if you are a good fit for a job. Some people from Illinois sued the company that made the program, saying it didn't follow the rules for handling personal data like your face geometry during the interview. The court said the case could continue in Illinois because the company allowed its software to be used there, but it threw out one part where there wasn't enough evidence that the company had directly profited from selling anyone's data. So, most of the case can keep going to see if the company broke any data privacy rules.",

Daniel  \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \nSix Illinois residents1 filed this putative class action alleging that Hire Vue, \nInc. (“HireVue”), a Utah -based software vendor,  violated the Illinois Biometric \nInformation Privacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. , when its  interactive  \nsoftware captured and collected their biometric information  during virtual job \ninterviews . HireVue now moves to dismiss the plaintiffs’ first amended complaint  \nunder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) . (R. 48.)  For the reasons \nset forth in this opinion, the motion  is granted  in part and denied in part.  \nBACKGROUND  \nHireVue  is a Delaware corporation based  in Utah  that develops and markets \nsoftware to assess job applicants’ performance during  virtual  interviews. ( FAC \n¶¶ 16, 19.) HireVue sells its software  to employers —including companies \nheadquartered in Illinois —who are looking to fill job openings. ( Id. ¶ 20.) HireVue’s  \nsoftware allows customers to  record video  interview s with potential candidate s and \n \n1 The plaintiffs’ full names are Kristen Deyerler, Max Ellithorpe, Bryen Zimmerman, \nChristopher Coats, Nicolas Galindo, and William Phemister. ( See generally  R. 17 (“FAC”).)  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 1 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n analyze the ir performance with artificial intelligence . (Id. ¶ 19.) Each recorded \ninterview yields “thousands of data points” that  are used to assess candidates’ \ncognitive ability, personality traits, emotional intelligence, and social aptitude. ( Id. \n¶ 21.)  \nThe plaintiffs are six Illinois residents who allege that HireVue captured and \ncollected  their biometric identifiers when they used HireVue’s platform to interview \nfor positions in Illinois . (See generally id .) The y filed this putative class action alleg ing \nthat HireVue’ s actions violate subsections 15(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the  BIPA . (See \nFAC.)  HireVue now moves to dismiss the first amended complaint  in its entirety \nunder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6).  (R. 48.)  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \n \nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) tests whether a federal court has \npersonal jurisdiction over a defendant. Curry v. Revolution Labs., LLC , 949 F.3d 385, \n392 (7th Cir. 2020). Although a plaintiff need not allege personal jurisdiction in their \ncomplaint, they bear the burden of establishing it once a defendant moves to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(2). Id.  at 392. At the pleading  stage, a plaintiff only needs to \nestablish  a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction to proceed. uBID, Inc. v. \nGoDaddy Grp., I nc., 623 F.3d 421, 423 (7th Cir. 2010). The plaintiff “is entitled to the \nresolution in its favor of all disputes concerning relevant facts presented in the \nrecord.” Purdue Rsch. Found. v . Sanofi -Synthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. \n2003) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The Court may weigh declarations  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n submitted by the parties  in evaluating whether the plaintiff has established its prima \nfacie case. Curry , 949 F.3d at 393. \nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, “test[s] the \nsufficiency of the complaint, not the merits of the case.” Gociman v. Loyola Univ. of \nChi., 41 F.4th 873, 885 (7th Cir. 2022). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint \nmust “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefend ant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009). The complaint must put the defendants on “fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted).  \nANALYSIS  \n \nI. H\nIREVUE’S RULE 12(B)(2)  MOTION  \nThe Court first addresses Hire Vue’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction. In a diversity action under Illinois law ,2 personal jurisdiction is \npermitted to the extent allowed  by due process. Bristol Meyers v. Super. Ct. , 137 S. \nCt. 1773, 1779 (2017); Rogers v. City of Hobart , 996 F.3d 812, 818 (7th Cir. 2021). \nFederal law recognizes both general and specific personal jurisdiction. General \npersonal jurisdiction exists over a defendant who has “continuous and systematic” \ncontacts with the forum state and is “essentially at home ” there. Daimler AG v. \nBauman , 571 U.S. 117, 119 (2014). By contrast, specific personal jurisdiction may be \n \n2 The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d) , et seq.   Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n exercised  only when (1) the defendant purposefully directs its activities at the forum \nstate or conducts business in that state, and (2) the alleged injury “arise[s] out of or \nrelate[s] to the defendant’s contacts” with the forum. Tamburo v. Dworkin , 601 F.3d \n693, 702 (7th Cir. 2010). In this case, the parties do not dispute that Illinois lacks \ngeneral personal jurisdiction over Hire Vue; the relevant question  is whether the \nCourt may exercise  specific personal jurisdiction over the company . \nIn support of its Rule 12(b)(2) motion, HireVue submitted the unrebutted \ndeclarations of its former Senior Vice President of Product, Richard Simmons, and its \nChief Financial Officer, Kevin Coombs. (See R. 57 -1 (“Simmons Decl.”); R. 57 -2 \n(“Coombs Decl.”). )  \nThe Simmons d eclaration provides an overview of HireVue’s software platform  \nand its relationship to  the plaintiffs’  individual allegations . (See generally  Simmons \nDecl.) Simmons states that HireVue provides its customers  with an “out -of-the-box” \ninterview platform, which employers  can customize and configure to fit their needs. \n(Simmons Decl. ¶  6.) Interview applicants’ data are collected and analyzed with  \n“HireVue Assessments,” an “optional add- on component” to HireVue’s  basic software \npackage . (Simmons Decl. ¶¶  9–16.) Simmons  states that most of HireVue’s customers \ndo not use the HireVue Assessments technol ogy and  represents  that only one of the \nplaintiffs —Max Ellithorpe —was interviewed using  this technology . (Id. ¶¶ 16, 29) \nSimmons also state s that HireVue Asse ssments  was not developed in Illinois and no \nteam in Illinois was involved  in its creation . (Id. ¶ 18.)  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n The Coombs declaration provides an overview of HireVue’s corporate \noperations and presence in Illinois. ( See generally Coombs Decl.) Coombs states that \nHireVue has no meaningful corporate presence in Illinois and does not market its \ntechnology to individual residents of the state . (Coombs Decl. ¶¶  4–5, 8.) He states \nthat HireVue does not  control over where its customers deploy its software. ( Id. ¶ 9.) \nCoombs concedes, however,  that HireVue employs eight individuals who reside in \nIllinois . (Id. ¶ 11.) He  further states that HireVue is party to a service agreement \nwith Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, one of the “operating divisions” of Health \nCare Service Corporation  (“HCSC”), the company that Ellithorpe interviewed with.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 13–16.) In its briefing, HireVue admits that HCSC is headquartered in \nChicago, Illinois. (R. 49 at 12.)  \nAccepting the information in the declarations as true, the  Court finds that the \nplaintiffs have met their burden of establishing a prima facie case for exercising  \nspecific personal jurisdiction.  The plaintiffs have alleged —and HireVue does not \ndispute —that HireVue intentionally caused its biometric software to be marketed \nand sold to at least one company headquartered  in Illinois and that this software was \nused to capture at least one of the plaintiff’s biometric identifiers.  (See generally \nFAC.)  These facts are sufficient to establish that Hire Vue “purposefully a vailed itself \nof the Illinois market.” GoDaddy , 623 F.3d at 429. In the retail context, the  Seventh \nCircuit has held that a single  online  sale of a  tangible product to a customer in Illinois \nis sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over a retailer. NBA Props. , Inc. v. \nHANWJH , 46 F.4th 614, 624 (7th Cir. 2022), cert. denied , 143 S. Ct. 577 (2023). It Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n follows that a sale of a n interactive  software product to a single customer in Illinois  \nthat is used by the customer to capture Illinois residents’ biometric data  may be \nsufficient to establish specific personal jurisdiction as well.  See King v. PeopleNet \nCorp., 21 C 2774, 2021 WL 5006692, at  *6 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2021) ( finding  that a \nthird- party software vendor’s  contracts  with Illinois -based companies who mandated \nthat their staff use its biometric technology were sufficient to establish minimum \ncontacts).  \nHireVue cites several cases for the proposition a third party’s contacts with a \nforum state may not be imputed to a n out -of-state technology vendor  simply because \nthe vendor  and the third party contract ed with each other. (See R. 49 at 13 (citing \nSalkauskaite v. Sephora USA, Inc. , No. 18 C 8507, 2020 WL 2796122 (N.D. Ill. May \n30, 2020); Bray v. Lathem Time Co. , No. 19  C 3157, 2020 WL 1492742 (C.D. Ill. Mar. \n27, 2020)); R. 50 (citing Redd v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc. , 22 C 6779, 2023 WL \n3505264, at *3 (N.D. Il l. May 17, 2023) ).) HireVue argues that the plaintiffs similarly \nattempt to impute HCSC’s contacts with Illinois to HireVue,  even though it  had no \nintention of targeting the forum state .  \nAs the plaintiffs point out,  however,  the cases that HireVue  cites  are \ndistinguishable because they involved allegations that the technology  at issue was \ndeployed  in the forum state without the defendants’ knowledge.  (See R. 51 at 13.) Here, \nHireVue admits that it knowingly executed a service  agreement with an Illinois \nheadquartered company, and that company used HireVue’s artificial intelligence \nsoftware to interview one of the plaintiffs in Illinois. (Coombs Decl. ¶  16; Simmons Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n Decl. ¶  29.) These allegations are sufficient to establish that HireVue “purposefully \ndirected” activity at Illinois. Tamburo , 601 F.3d at 702; see also Redd, 2023 WL \n3505264 at *3 ( “It is possible for a defendant to establish the requisite contacts via a \nthird party so long as the defendant itself targets the forum.” ). \nHireVue  also suggests that, because Ellithorpe  is the only plaintiff who was \ninterviewed by an Illinois -based company , the other plaintiffs cannot establish \npersonal jurisdiction . (R. 49 at 12 (“ Because Ellithorpe is the sole Plaintiff who \ninteracted with the relevant technology, he is the only one who could, in theory, \nestablish personal jurisdiction.”).)  While the personal jurisdiction analysis is \n“plaintiff -specific,” Arnold  v. Goldstar Fin. Sys.,  Inc., No. 01 C 7694, 2002 WL \n1941546, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Au g. 22, 2002)  (Phillips  Exeter Acad.  v. Howard  Phillips  \nFund,  Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 289 (1st Cir.1999)), “ a strict causal relationship between \nthe defendant ’s in-state activity and the litigation” is not required . Ford Motor Co. v. \nMont . Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct. , 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1026 (2021). Instead , to establish \npersonal jurisdiction for each of the plaintiffs’ claims,  the claims need only “arise out \nof or relate to  the defendant’s contacts with the forum.”  Id. (emphasis added).  \nAlthough “not just any relationship will suffi ce,” due process is satisfied when there \nis a sufficiently close nexus between “the defendant, the forum[s], and the litigation.” \nDzananovic v. Bumble, Inc. , 21 C 6925, 2023 WL 4405833, at *5 (N.D. Ill. July 7, \n2023) (quoting NBA Props., 46 F.4th at 626 n.18). \nHere, all six of the plaintiffs allege that they interviewed for positions in \nIllinois  using a software that HireVue  marketed and sold to at least one company  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n headquartered in Illinois . (See generally  FAC.) Moreover, they each allege that they \nwere physically located in Illinois when they interacted with HireVue’s online \nsoftware platform . (See generally  id.) These allegations are sufficient  to establish \nadequate connections between HireVue and the forum state as to each of the \nplaintiffs’ claims . \nIn sum, the Court concludes that the plaintiffs have met their burden of \nmaking  “a threshold showing of minimum contacts”  with Illinois . Curry , 949 F.3d at \n402 (citation omitted). To rebut this prima facie showing, Hirevue  must present \ncompelling reasons why haling it into court here offends traditional notions of fair \nplay and substantial justice.  Id. Hire Vue has not pointed to any reason why litigating \nits claims in Illinois would be unreasonable or unfair.  (See generally R. 49.)  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that  it may exercise  specific personal jurisdiction \nover HireVue and denies the defendant’s Rule 12(b)(2)  motion.  \nII. HIREVUE’S RULE 12(B)(6)  MOTION  \nThe Court next turns to Hire Vue’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion . Unlike a motion to \ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  is limited in scope to \nthe sufficiency of the allegations set forth in the complaint. Geinosky v. City of Chi. , \n675 F.3d 743, 745 n.1 (7th Cir. 2012). This means that while the Simmons and \nCoombs declaration s were  properly considered in the context of HireVue’s  Rule \n12(b)(2) motion, they are inappropriate to consider in ruling on its Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Burlingham v.  U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs. , No. 22  C 1134, 2023 WL \n6390798, at *4 (E.D. Wis. Sept. 30, 2023)  (ignoring declaration submitted in support \nof Rule 12(b)(2) motion in deciding parallel  Rule 12(b)(6) motion); JT’s Frames, Inc. Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 8 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n v. Casares, 16  C 2504, 2018 WL 835225, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 13, 2018)  (same). The \nCourt therefore ignores the factual contentions set forth in the Simmons and Coombs \ndeclarations  and considers only the allegations in the first amended complaint  in \ndeciding HireVue’s 12(b)(6) motion.  \nHireVue raises several arguments in support of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). \nFirst, it argues that  the plaintiffs’ allegations constitute an extraterritorial \napplication of the BIPA.  (R. 49 at 14– 15.) Second, it argues that, under principles of \nstatutory interpretation, the plaintiffs’ claims fall outside of the scope of the statute, \nare foreclosed  by other legislative enactments , or are subject to exemptions . (Id. at \n15–24.) Finally, it argues that the allegations fail to state a claim.  (Id. at 24 –27.) The \nCourt addresses each argument in turn. Because many of HireVue’s arguments are \nfact-specific, the Court declines to decide their merits  prior to summary judgment.  \nA. Extraterritoriality  \nFirst, Hire Vue argues that the plaintiffs’ BIPA claims violate Illinois’ \nextraterritoriality doctrine.  (R. 49 at 14– 15.) Under this doctrine, a statute that does \nnot clearly contemplate extraterritorial effect cannot be applied unless “the circumstances that relate to the disputed transaction occur primarily and \nsubstantially in Illinois.” Avery v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 835 N.E.2d 801, \n854 (Ill. 2005). Courts have recognized that , in the context of BIPA claims, \nextraterritoriality  “is a highly fact -based analysis that is generally inappropriate for \nthe motion to dismiss stage.” Vance v. Int’l Bus. Mach.  Corp. , No. 20 C 577, 2020 WL \n5530134, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 15, 2020)  (collecting cases) .  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n Hire Vue cites Neals v. PAR Tech nology Corp oration , in which the district court \ndismissed the plaintiff ’s BIPA claims  because she  did not allege whether she was in \nIllinois when the defendant  scanned her fingerprints. 419 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1091 \n(N.D. Ill. 2019). Here, by contrast, the plaintiffs allege that they accessed Hire Vue’s \ninterview platform while they were in Illinois  through the use of a webcam . (See FAC \n¶¶ 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 57.)  While Hire Vue disputes the veracity of these allegations \nand repres ents that any biometric data  collected  was stored outside of  Illinois , at this \nstage  the Court is bound to draw all factual inferences in the plaintiffs’ favor. \nVesuvius USA Corp. v. Am. Com. Lines LLC , 910 F.3d 331, 333 (7th Cir. 2018). The \nCourt declines to rule on Hire Vue’s extraterritoriality arguments until a  record has \nbeen developed.  Accordingly, the Court denies its Rule 12(b)(6) motion on this basis.  \nB. Statutory Interpretation Arguments  \nNext, HireVue raises several statutory  interpretation  arguments, arguing that  \nthe plaintiffs’ claims are either not covered by the BIPA , are foreclosed  by other \nlegislation , or are subject to exemptions .  \nFirst, HireVue  argues  that the plaintiffs have failed to allege that their facial \nscans are “biometric identifiers” under the  BIPA. This argument is undermined  by \nthe plain language of the BIPA,  however,  which defines “biometric identifiers” to \ninclude, among other things,  “face geometry.” 740 ILCS 14/10. The first amended \ncomplaint  allege s that HireVue used “facial expression and screening technology . . . \nto identify and assess candidates by collecting their facial geometry.” (FAC ¶  22.) \nThese allegations  are all that is needed at the pleading stage. See Wilk v. Brainshark, \nInc., 21 C 4794, 2022 WL 4482842, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 27, 2022) (denying motion to Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n dismiss BIPA claims based on the statutory definition of “biometric identifiers” where \nplaintiff alleged that facial features in sales professionals’ videos were analyzed and \ncollected through facial -mapping technology).  \nSecond, HireVue  argues that the plaintiffs’ BIPA claims are precluded by \nIllinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act (“AIVIA”) , 820 ILCS 42/1 et seq. \nHireVue appeals to the principle that  “where  two statutes  appear to be in conflict , \nthe more  specific controls  over the more  general .” State v. Mikusch , 562 N.E.2d 168, \n173 ( Ill. 1990). Because the AIVIA specifically regulates the  use of artificial \nintelligence to analyze videos  submitted by job applicants , HireVue argues that the \nplaintiffs  may not bring claims under the BIPA related to HireVue’s use of its online \nvideo platform .  \nThe problem with HireVue’s argument is that it  assumes that the BIPA and \nthe AIVIA impose conflicting —as opposed to concurrent —obligations. In interpreting \nstatutes , the  Court must presume that the Illinois legislature “acts rationally and \nwith full knowledge of all previous enactments” and that “the legislature will not enact a law which completely contradicts a prior statute without an express repeal of \nit.” Mikusch , 562 N.E.2d at 170. As the plaintiffs point out, nothing in the AIVIA \nindicates that the legislature intended to repeal or preempt any portion of  the BIPA \nwhen it enacted the statute , or that the legislature intended to limit  the BIPA’s \nprivate right of actio n. (R. 51 at 15– 17.) Although HireVue points to the fact that the \ntwo statutes impose different consent, retention, and disclosure obligations, these \napparent conflicts do not compel the conclusion that the statutes are entirely Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n inconsistent with one another  or that the AIVIA forecloses  the plaintiffs’ BIPA claims . \nSee Mikusch , 562 N.E.2d at 173.  Accordingly, the Court denies  HireVue’s motion to \ndismiss on this basis.  \nIn yet another  flourish of  statutory interpretation, HireVue suggests  that the \nBIPA’s “financial institution” exemption bars the plaintiffs’ claims.  (R. 49 at 21–24.) \nSection 25(c) of the BIPA provides that the statute does not apply “in any manner to \na financial institution or an affiliate of a financial institution that is subject to Title  V \nof the federal Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act (‘GLBA’).” 740 ILCS 14/25.  \nCourts in this district have commented that the financial institution exemption \nis akin to an affirmative defense, which cannot be considered in the context of a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion unless the defendant’s entitlement to the defense is apparent from \nthe fa ce of the complaint. See Davis v. Jumio Corp. , No. 2 2 C 776, 2023 WL 2019048, \nat *2 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 14, 2023); Patterson v. Respondus, Inc., 593 F. Supp. 3d 783, 819 n.18 (N.D. Ill. 2022)) (citing United States v. Lewis, 411 F.3d 838, 842 (7th Cir. 2005)).  \nThe first amended complaint contains no allegations  upon which the Court can \ninfer  that HireVue is a financial institution subject to the GBLA. To the contrary , \nHireVue ’s defense rests on the apparently novel and fact -specific assertion that  \nHireVue ’s contracts with health insurance companies  like HCSC  entitle it to the \nfinancial institution exemption . (See R. 47 at 23 (“[T]he practical effect of applying \nthe BIPA to HireVue would be to apply the BIPA to HCSC, which is precisely what § 25(c) forbids.”).) It would be premature to resolve such a fact -specific argument it at \nthis stage.  See Davis, 2023 WL 2019048, at *4 (holding that whether cryptocurrency Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n exchange qualified as a financial institution for purposes of BIPA’s financial \ninstitution exemption “presents a question of fact that cannot be determined based \non the allegations of the [c]omplaint”).  Accordingly, the Court declines to consider \nthe merits of this argument and  denies HireVue’s motion to dismiss on this basis.  \nC. Failure to State a Claim  \nFinally, the Court arrives at the question of whether the plaintiffs’ allegations \nare sufficient to state claims under the BIPA.  The plaintiffs allege violations under \nsubsections 15(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the BIPA.  Because each of these subsections gives \nrise to a separate claim, see, e.g. , Clark v. Microsoft Corp. , No. 23 C 695, 2023 WL \n5348760, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 21, 2023), the Court addresses each in turn.  \nFirst, HireVue argues that the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under \n§ 15(a) of  the BIPA , which requires entities who are “in possession” of biometric \ninformation to “develop a written policy, made available to the public, establishing a \nretention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric identifiers.” \n740 ILCS 14/15(a). Because  the plaintiffs  have  allege d that HireVue “ collect [ed], \ncapture [d] and use [d]” their facial geometry and “did not make publicly available any \nbiometric ret ention policy that disclosed how long it stored the biometrics it collected ,” \n(FAC ¶¶  5, 22, 25) , their  allegations are sufficient to state a claim under § 15(a). See \nRogers v. CSX  Intermodal  Terminals,  Inc., 409 F. Supp. 3d 612, 618 (N.D. Ill. 2019) \n(holding that allegations that the defendant “failed to make publicly available any \nretention or destruction policies”  despite collection of the plaintiff’s biometric data  \nwere sufficient to state a claim under § 15(a)).  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n HireVue argues that the plaintiffs have not alleged that it was “in possession” \nof their biometric  data. (R. 49 at 25.)  The BIPA does not define this term,  however . \nSee 740 ILCS 14/ 10. Given the ordinary meaning of “in possession ,” the first amended \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that HireVue violated  § 15(a)  by capturing and collecting \nthe plaintiffs’ biometric data . See People v. Grant , 52 N.E.3d 308, 313 (Ill. 2016)  \n(“[The] most reliable indicator of [the legislature’s]  intent is the statutory language \nitself, given its plain and ordinary meaning”) ; see also Possession , Black ’s Law \nDictionary (11th ed. 2019) . Accordingly, the Court denies HireVue’s motion to dismiss \non this basis.  \nSimilar ly, HireVue  argues that it is not subject to §  15(b) of BIPA  which \nprohibits, among other things, “captur[ing] [and] collect[ing]” an individual’s \nbiometric information without their consent.  740 ILCS 14/15 (b). HireVue  argues that \nthe plaintiffs cannot state a claim under this subsection because the company does \nnot collect or store  biometric data.  (R. 49 at 25– 26.) But the first amended complaint  \nalleges the opposite: that HireVue actively gathered the plaintiffs’ biometric data \nthrough its software platform . (See FAC ¶¶ 22, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49, 55, 73.)  The Court \nis bound to accept these allegations as true  and draw all inferences in the plaintiffs’ \nfavor. Vesuvius, 910 F.3d at 333. The Court denies HireVue’s motion to dismiss on \nthis basis as well.  \nNext, HireVue moves to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims under § 15(c) , which  \nprohibits  a company from “sell[ing], leas[ing], trad[ing], or otherwise profit[ing]” from \nan individual’s biometric data.  740 ILCS 14/15(c).  In the context of § 15(c), the Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 14 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n Seventh Circuit has held that pleading a “bare violation” of the statute is not enough; \ninstead, plaintiffs must allege how th e alleged  conduct harmed them individually. \nThornley  v. Clearview  AI, Inc., 984 F.3d 1241,  1246 –47 (7th Cir. 2021) .  \nHere, the Court agrees with HireVue that the plaintiffs’ allegations fail to state \na claim. The plaintiffs allege that HireVue  profited from their biometric information \nbecause its clients paid for use of its software.  (FAC ¶  26.) But the  fact that HireVue \nprofited from the sale of  its software does not plausibly indicate that it sold, leased, \ntraded, or otherwise profited from the  plaintiffs’  biometric data itself. Moreover, the \nallegations in the first amended complaint plead a “bare violation” of the statute without an explanation of how the plaintiffs have been harmed. Thornley , 984 F.3d \nat 1246– 47. Because the first amended c omplaint does not allege that  HireVue \nprofited directly from the collection of biometric data or explain how the plaintiffs \nwere individually harmed  by this activity , the Court grants HireVue’s motion to \ndismiss as to this claim.  \nFinally, HireVue argues that the plaintiffs’ § 15(d) claim fails because the first \namended complaint does not plausibly allege  that HireVue “disclose[d], redisclose[d], \nor otherwise disseminate[d]” their data. 740 ILCS  14/15(d). But the first amended \ncomplaint  alleges that HireVue’s software “also results in the dissemination of \nbiometrics to third parties, such as data storage vendors.” (FAC ¶  5.) Whether or not \nthis allegation is true, it must be accepted as such at this stage. Vesuvius, 910 F.3d \nat 333.  And allegations that HireVue “disseminated [the plaintiffs’] biometric data to \nother firms that hosted the information in their data centers” are sufficient to state a Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n \nclaim under § 15(d). Figueroa v. Kronos Inc. , 454 F. Supp. 3d 772, 785 (N.D. Ill. 2020). \nThe Court therefore denies HireVue’s motion to dismiss on this basis.  \nCONCLUSION  \n \nFor the reasons set forth in this memorandum opinion,  the Court grants \nDefendant HireVue  Inc.’s motion to dismiss  in part and denies it in part.  The Court \ndenies HireVue’s Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfinds that it may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over HireVue  with respect to \nall pending claims . The Court  also grants HireVue’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion as to the  \nplaintiffs’ claims under §  15(c) of the BIPA . The motion is denied  as to all other \nclaims. HireVue will have 21 days  to answer the complaint. It is so ordered.  \n \n Date: 2/26/2024             \n        JEREMY C.

    "summary": "1. Summary: In this case, the court addressed a request by Albuquerque Public Schools for a 10-day extension to provide supplemental discovery responses, which was granted. Plaintiff opposed this extension, claiming delays and potential prejudice, but the court found good cause due to unforeseen circumstances faced by the defense counsel’s law clerk. The case also highlighted concerns about the plaintiff’s counsel possibly using generative AI to draft legal documents without adequate review, as the documents contained unwarranted legal contentions.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether Albuquerque Public Schools should be granted an extension of time to supplement their discovery responses and whether the use of generative AI by Plaintiff's counsel met professional standards.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court granted the extension of time to Albuquerque Public Schools, citing good cause and no bad faith in the request. The court also cautioned Plaintiff’s counsel to diligently review AI-drafted filings to ensure compliance with legal standards.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation: The court allowed the school district more time to turn in important documents because one of their lawyers faced unexpected issues. The judge also reminded the other lawyer (from the plaintiff's side) to be careful when using computer programs to help write their documents, making sure everything is correct and follows the rules.",

Doc. 150. Therein, Defendant requested  a 10-day extension of time to produce the supplemental discovery responses it was \ncompelled to produce by October 3, 2025. Id.  The Court granted the motion without granting \nPlaintiff an opportunity to respond on October 2, 2025. Doc. 151.  \nThat same day, P laintiff filed a document titled “Plaintiff’s Notice of Preserved \nObjections and Request for Appropriate Relief.” Doc. 152. In that filing, Plaintiff requested “that the Court deem all objections and arguments set forth in the attached unfiled opposition [to Defendant’s motion for an extension of time] (Exhibit A) as preserved for the record. ” Id. at 2. \nPlaintiff’s filing is procedurally irregular. Plaintiff could have filed a response before the Court issued its decision on the Defendant’s motion , though the Court acknowledges there was a \nrelatively short time frame to do so . Alternatively, Plaintiff could have objected to the Court’s \norder granting the extension. See F\nED. R. CIV. P. 72(a). Both procedures would have preserved \nPlaintiff’s argument for appeal. See United States v. Bradley , 97 F.4th  1214, 1221 n.8 (10th Case 1:23-cv-00899-GBW-JMR     Document 153     Filed 10/08/25     Page 1 of 62 Cir. 2024) (“[I] n order to preserve an issue for appeal, a party needs to alert the court to the issue \nand seek a ruling.”) (quotation omitted). Instead, Plaintiff filed a preservation notice that likely \ndoes not  actually  preserve her arguments because it does not “seek a ruling.”1 See id.  \nNevertheless, because the Court issued its order prior to the deadline within which Plaintiff had \nto respond, the Court amends its decision to take into account  Plaintiff’s  intended response \n(Doc.  152- 1).  \nHaving reviewed the motion, Plaintiff’s response, and the relevant law, the Court does \nnot alter its decision. See Doc. 151. Defendant’s motion is GRANTED.  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b)(1) provides that the Court may extend a deadline for \n“good cause.” FED. R. CIV. P. 6(b)(1)(A).  If a motion to extend a deadline is filed “ after the time \nhas expired ,” then the moving party must also show excusable neglect. FED. R. CIV. P. \n6(b)(1)(B). Rule 6(b)(1) must “ be liberally construed to advance the goal of trying each case on \nthe merits. ” Rachel v. Troutt , 820 F.3d 390, 394 (10th Cir. 2016) . Indeed, “ an application for \nextension of time under Rule 6(b)(1)(A) normally will be granted in the absence of bad faith on \nthe part of the party seeking relief or prejudice to the adverse party .” Wright & Miller, 4B \nFEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE  § 1165 (4th ed.).  \nHere, there is good cause to extend the deadline for  Defendant’s supplemental responses \nto discovery by a modest ten days. See FED. R. CIV. P. 6(b)(1)(A).  The Court ordered Defendant \nto substantially supplement its discovery responses, which is inherently resource intensive. \n \n1 Plaintiff cites Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 46 as the legal basis for the notice. Doc. 152 \nat 2. However, Rule 46 is  plainly  inapplicable here . See United States v. Williams , No. 2:15- CV-\n00054- RJS-DBP, 2023 WL 11960837, at *17 (D. Utah Sept. 30, 2023) (“ As is clear from the \nRule ’s history and decades of settled Tenth Circuit precedent, Rule 46 applies to trial practice. ”). \n Case 1:23-cv-00899-GBW-JMR     Document 153     Filed 10/08/25     Page 2 of 63 Defense counsel stated that the “law clerk working on this matter was called away ” due to a \n“tragedy.” Doc. 150. While the Court agrees with Plaintiff that defense counsel, not her  law \nclerk, bears the responsibility for timely compl iance with Court orders , see Doc. 152- 1 at 5 \n(“[C]ounsel of record bear a nondelegable responsibility for compliance with court orders.”) , it is \nalso reasonable that defense counsel may have enlisted her law clerk for assistance with the \nformidable task of supplementing Defendant’s discovery responses. There is no indication that Defendant’s request was made in bad faith . And Plaintiff will not suffer meaningful prejudice \nbecause of a ten -day extension of time . Given the unexpected event in the law clerk’s personal \nlife, the short length of the proposed extension, and the burdensome nature of the task, the Court finds that Defendant has shown good cause for an extension of the deadline to supplement its discovery responses.  \nNow, the Court turns to Plaintiff’s arguments. First, P laintiff argues that “ APS has had \nample time and notice to comply ” with the Court’s order compelling APS to supplement its \ndiscovery responses. Doc. 152- 1 at 2 , 4. Plaintiff also argues that she has been prejudiced by \nDefendant’s  pattern of delay. Id.  at 5. The Court agrees with Plaintiff and discussed both points \nin the original order granting Defendant’s motion for an extension of time. See, e.g., Doc. 151 at \n2 (“No party should be required to wait nearly a year for discovery responses. . . . Defendant’s \nfailure to thoroughly respond to Plaintiff’s discovery requests has unnecessarily delayed this \nmatter and has no doubt needlessly increased the costs of this litigation.”). However, even in light of these factors, it would be unreasonable to deny the Defendant such a short extension of time that was requested in good faith. \n   Case 1:23-cv-00899-GBW-JMR     Document 153     Filed 10/08/25     Page 3 of 64 Plaintiff also argues that Defendant has not shown “excusable neglect .” Doc. 152- 1 at 4 –\n5. But because Defendant requested an extension of time before the deadline expired,2 \n“excusable neglect ” is not the appropriate legal standard. See FED. R. CIV. P. 6(b)(1)(B).  \nPlaintiff also makes arguments related to sanctioning the Defendant. But again, a  \nresponse to Defendant’s motion is not the appropriate mechanism by which to request sanctions. \nSee F ED. R. CIV. P. 11(c)(2) (“ A motion for sanctions must be made separately from any other \nmotion . . . .”).  \nPlaintiff also requests, without citation to any relevant legal authority, that the Court \nimpose eight conditions on the extension of time. See Doc. 152 -1 at 7 –8. Some of these \nconditions are duplicative of existing orders. See, e.g. , id. (requesting a “[f]ull, verified \nsupplementation by [the] final deadline ” and “no rolling production after the final deadline”). \nSome of these conditions are unrelated to the extension request. See, e.g., i d. (requesting that \nDefendant provide a “ [p]rivilege log,”  a “[p]rod uction transparency” certification , and participate \nin a post -production “ [c]ompliance conference” ). And some are in plain contradiction with each \nother. For example, Plaintiff requests that the Court order Defendant to partially produce \nwhatever responsive material it has immediately , id. at 7 , but t hen requests that the Court order  \nDefend ant provide “ [u]nified”  responses to Plaintiff’s discovery requests. Id. The Court does not \nsee the need to impose any of Plaintiff’s proposed conditions. \n   \n \n2 Plaintiff also argues —referencing the October 3, 2025, production deadline : “APS waited until \nOctober 1 to seek more time. This reflects a lack of diligence under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) .” \nDoc. 152- 1 at 4. The Court disagrees . Requesting an extension of time two days in advance , \nparticularly in light of an  unforeseen emergenc y, is hardly an “ eleventh -hour extension request .” \nSee id.  at 7.   Case 1:23-cv-00899-GBW-JMR     Document 153     Filed 10/08/25     Page 4 of 65 Finally, the Court is compelled to note that Plaintiff’s briefing bears signs that counsel \ncontinues  to neglect to proper ly review her filings and may be continuing to inappropriately use \ngenerative artificial intelligence  (“AI”)  to draft her filings. Plaintiff’s counsel has already been \nsanctioned once for the inappropriate use of AI. See Doc.  149. To be clear, the use of generative \nAI is not in and of itself problematic, but an attorney must diligently review AI -generated \nbriefing to ensure its accuracy and compliance with Rule 11. See Formal Ethics Advisory \nOpinion No. 2024-004, S TATE BAR OF NEW MEXICO  (Sept. 24, 2024), \nhttps://www.sbnm.org/Portals/NMBAR/GenAI%20Formal%20Opinion%20-\n%20Sept_2024_FINAL.pdf  (providing guidance on the ethical use of generative artificial \nintelligence in the legal practice).  \nWhile Plaintiff’s  briefing no longer contains fabricated  citations, it does contain several  \n“legal contentions” that are simply not “warranted by existing law .” F ED. R. CIV. P. 11(b) (2). For \nexample, in the legal standard section of the brief, Plaintiff supplies the following rule statement: “Withholding responsive material that are ready for production, while seeking additional time for other items, is itself sanctionable under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b).” Doc. 152-1 at 4. Rule 37(b) makes no such statement. Nor is the Court aware of, and Plaintiff does not provide, any case law that supports this proposition.\n3 Notably, throughout this litigation, Plaintiff’s briefing has \ncontained significant citations to case law. However, this most recent filing  contains no case \ncitations. Because of the syntactic similarity to Plaintiff’s prior briefing, the Court is concerned  \nthat Plaintiff may have used the same generative AI to draft this response brief, but in lieu  of \n \n3 Plaintiff provides several other unsupported or inaccurate rule statements. However, because \nthe Court wishes  to urge more diligent conduct, rather than further sanction counsel, the Court \nwill not belabor the point.  Case 1:23-cv-00899-GBW-JMR     Document 153     Filed 10/08/25     Page 5 of 66 verifying the legal contentions, just  removed any citations to case law. Without reaching any \nconclusions  as to counsel’s behavior in this instance , the Court  once again cautions  Plaintiff’s \ncounsel to be  more diligent with her briefing.  \nIn summary, Defendant’s Motion for Extension of Time to Supplement its Discovery \nResponses to Plaintiffs’ Discovery to Defendant Albuquerque Public Schools (Doc. 150) is \nGRANTED. Defendant’s supplemental discovery responses are due October 13, 2025.    \n \n______________________________ \nJENNIFER M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The Estate of Gene B. Lokken and others filed a class-action lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group, Inc., and naviHealth, Inc., alleging the misuse of an AI program, nH Predict, to deny medical coverage in breach of insurance agreements. The United States District Court for the District of Minnesota addressed a motion by the defendants to bifurcate the discovery process, which would separately handle the merits of the named plaintiffs before addressing broader class certification, but the court denied this motion. The involvement of AI centers on whether nH Predict was used improperly instead of human medical directors to make coverage decisions violating contractual obligations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the discovery process should be bifurcated to first address the specific claims of the named plaintiffs regarding their coverage denials allegedly made by AI, before moving to class-wide discovery and potential class certification.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion to bifurcate the discovery process, finding that bifurcation would not promote judicial efficiency and could lead to additional legal disputes over the separation of merits and class discovery, possibly delaying the case unnecessarily.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you and many others were told by an insurance company that doctors would always handle your case, but instead, they used a computer program to decide if they'd pay for your healthcare. You took them to court because you think that's not fair. The company wanted the court to first only look at how this affected you and a few others before thinking about everybody else. The court said no to this idea because splitting up the investigation in this way would make things more complicated and take longer for everyone involved.",
    "full_text": "  \n \n  \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nDISTRICT OF MINNESOTA \n \n \nThe Estate of Gene B. Lokken, et al., \n \n Plaintiffs, \n \nv. \n \nUnitedHealth Group, Inc., et al., \n \n Defendants.   \nCase No. 23-cv-3514 (JRT/SGE) \n \n \n \n \n                     ORDER  \n  \n \nThis matter is before the Court on Defendants’ Motion to Amend the Pretrial \nScheduling Order (Dkt. 115). The Court heard oral argument on the motion September 4, \n2025. (See Dkt. 125.) For the reasons stated during the hearing, United States Magistrate \nJudge Shannon G. Elkins, denied Defendants’ motion on the record. This Order \nmemorializes the Court’s ruling. \nBACKGROUND \nThis is a putative class action alleging that UnitedHealth Group, Inc., and \nnaviHealth, Inc., used an artificial intelligence program called nH Predict to deny medical \ncare coverage in violation of the terms of the Plaintiffs’ insurance agreements. Defendants \nmoved to dismiss the Complaint, and United States District Judge John R. Tunheim \ngranted-in-part and denied-in-part the Motion. (Dkt. 91.) Judge Tunheim determined that \nseveral of Plaintiffs’ state claims were preempted by federal statute, but he allowed \nPlaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith \nand fair dealing to proceed. He wrote that these claims “effectively arise out of CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 1 of 7  \n \n2 \n [Defendants’] evidence of coverage documents because the question [is] whether UHC \ncomplied with its statement that claim decisions would be made by ‘clinical services staff’ \nand ‘physicians’ when it allegedly used artificial intelligence.” (Dkt. 91 at 19.)  \nAfter receiving this partially adverse ruling, Defendants requested Judge Tunheim \nallow them to file a motion to reconsider the Order. (Dkt. 95.) Judge Tunheim denied the \nrequest but clarified his previous order stating, \n. . . UHC requests clarification from the Court on the scope of the \ncontract claims and damages. The contract claims survived \npreemption due to their independence from the Medicare Act, which \nlimited the Court’s analysis to the Evidence of Coverage (“EOC”) \ndocuments provided by UHC. Accordingly, the contract claims are \nlimited to breaches of EOC terms. \n(Dkt. 104 at 2.)  \nDefendants then filed the instant motion on August 21, 2025, asking this Court to \namend the pretrial scheduling order to bifurcate discovery into two stages. Defendants \npropose the first stage would allow discovery only for the “threshold factual question of \nwhether Defendants used nH Predict in place of physician medical directors to make \nadverse coverage determinations related to the named Plaintiffs’ care in skilled nursing \nfacilities.” (Dkt. 117 at 7.) After the first stage of discovery, Defendants state, the case \nwould be ripe for summary judgment to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact \nexists with respect to the named Plaintiffs. Under Defendants’ proposal, stage two \ndiscovery, which would include expert and class-based discovery, would take place only \nif the court determines that the named Plaintiffs have demonstrated genuine issues of \nmaterial fact. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 2 of 7  \n \n3 \n DISCUSSION \nI. Legal Standard \nThe federal rules provide that the Pretrial Scheduling Order “may be modified only \nfor good cause . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4). Rule 42 allows courts to “issue any . . . orders \nto avoid unnecessary cost or delay.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(3). Furthermore, and much more \ngenerally, Rule 1 mandates that the Rules “be construed, administered, and employed by \nthe court and the parties to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every \naction and proceeding.” \nThe federal rules also provide, “[a]t an early practicable time after a person sues or \nis sued as a class representative, the court must determine by order whether to certify the \naction as a class action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(A). Whether to bifurcate discovery is \nwithin the discretion of the Court. See, e.g., Adam v. CHW Grp., Inc. , Case No. 21-cv-\n0091-LRR-MAR, 2021 WL 7285904, at *1-2 (N.D. Iowa June 29, 2021). The party \nseeking bifurcation bears the burden of showing that it will be prejudiced if the discovery \nis not bifurcated, and the party must allege undue burden, expense, or prejudice associated \nwith discovery. See, e.g., Ameritas Life Ins. Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co. , Case No. 16-cv-3006, \n2017 WL 432693, at *2 (D. Neb. Jan. 31, 2017), and United States v. Thompson , Case no. \n13-cv-180, 2014 WL 2624927, at *4 (D. Neb. June 12, 2014).  Although the Eighth Circuit \nhas not directly addressed the issue, the Court has noted that “[b]road discovery should \nusually be permitted prior to class certification.” Johnson v. Nekoosa-Edwards Paper Co. , \n558 F.2d 841, 845 n.5 (8th Cir. 1977), cited in Cosgrove v. OS Restaurant Servs., Inc. , \n2010 WL 11575055, at *3 (D. Minn. Aug. 31, 2010). CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 3 of 7  \n \n4 \n There are occasions where bifurcation is appropriate where resolving a “narrow, \npotentially dispositive issue” could obviate the need for costly class discovery. Physicians \nHealthsource, Inc. v. Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , Civ. No. 12-2132, 2014 WL 413534, \nat *4 (D.N.J. Feb. 4, 2014) (TCPA case). “Notwithstanding the general difficulty and \npotential drain on judicial resources in managing bifurcated discovery in class action \nlitigation, determining whether the advantages of bifurcation outweigh its disadvantages is \na factual inquiry assessed on a case-by-case basis.” Hanover 3201 Realty, LLC v. Village \nSupermarkets, Inc. , Civ. No. 14-1327, 2016 WL 4541870, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug. 31, 2016). \nII. Bifurcating discovery is inappropriate in this case.   \n \nDefendants argue that good cause exists to bifurcate discovery because it would \npromote efficient resolution of the dispute and preserve judicial economy. Defendants \npropose that the Court order the parties to conduct discovery into the merits of the named \nclass representatives first and require Plaintiffs to survive summary judgment before \nallowing any expert or class-based discovery. Plaintiffs argue that bifurcation would lead \nto additional, avoidable motion practice and that Defendants’ failure to seek bifurcation \nearlier in the litigation demonstrates a lack of diligence that undercuts their argument for \ngood cause. \nThe Court does not find Defendants’ arguments about efficiency persuasive. \nDefendants’ argument that bifurcation will save the parties the time and the expense of \nclass discovery assumes their success on a motion for summary judgment. However, if \ntheir motion for summary judgment fails, bifurcating discovery will only delay the case CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 4 of 7  \n \n5 \n and prejudice the Plaintiffs by requiring them to litigate discovery and summary judgment \ntwice. \nReviewing how this case has proceeded thus far, the Court also disagrees that \nbifurcation would promote judicial economy. Defendants resisted proceeding with \ndiscovery at the initial Rule 26(f) Report stage, at the Rule 16 scheduling conference, and \nagain by successfully moving to stay discovery last August. (See Dkt. 56, 69.) Then, when \nDefendants received a partially adverse ruling from Judge Tunheim, they decided not to \nanswer many of Plaintiffs’ discovery requests and instead moved, for the first time since \nthis case was filed in 2023, to bifurcate discovery so that they would only have to produce \ndiscovery relevant to the eight named Plaintiffs.  \nDefendants do not propose to conduct discovery on a narrow legal issue that might \nresolve a lurking dispositive issue. Rather, they propose to litigate the entire case as to the \nnamed plaintiffs and proceed to litigate with respect to the class only if the named Plaintiffs \nsurvive summary judgment. Defendants submit that they want summary judgment to \nprecede class certification to resolve one “straightforward” and “limited” question—\nwhether or not Defendants breached the terms of the insurance contracts by allegedly \nmaking coverage care determinations based on their use of nH Predict instead of relying \non individualized decisions by physician medical directors. But bifurcating discovery \ncreates tension between what is “class-related” discovery and what is “merits” discovery.  \nThe Supreme Court has stated that class certification analysis under Rule 23 \n“generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues \ncomprising the plaintiff’s cause of action.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 564 U.S. 338, CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 5 of 7  \n \n6 \n 351 (2011) (cleaned up). This inherent overlap, as well as the potentially thorny question \nof whether certain discovery would classify as class or merits discovery, has left courts \n“reluctant to bifurcate class-related discovery from discovery on the merits.” Ahmed v. \nHSBC Bank USA, Nat’l Ass’n , Civ. No. 15-2057, 2018 WL 501413, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Jan. \n5, 2018) (cleaned up).  \nA good example of this tension between class discovery and merits discovery played \nout in Plaintiffs’ contemporaneously filed Motion to Compel. ( See Dkt. 109.) Many of the \ndiscovery requests made by Plaintiffs went unanswered because Defendants perceived the \nrequests to relate to class discovery.  But many of the discovery responses Plaintiffs moved \nto compel would be relevant to both the “merits” of the case and the “class certification” \nissues.  \nThe Court finds that bifurcating discovery in this case would lead to avoidable \ndisputes over whether a particular discovery request relates to the merits or to class \ncertification. This would not economize the judicial involvement in this case and could \npotentially compound it, frustrating rather than furthering judicial economy. \nAdditionally, this Court does not read Judge Tunheim’s Order as narrowing the \nscope of the dispute in the way Defendants argue. This Court does not believe Judge \nTunheim intended the parties to litigate only the claims as they relate to the named \nPlaintiffs first. Rather Judge Tunheim’s task in ruling on the Motion to Dismiss was to \ndetermine whether the claims were preempted by the Medicare Act. As his subsequent \nOrder clarifies, the contract-based claims survived preemption due to their independence \nfrom the Medicare Act and because the contract claims were limited to breach of the CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 130     Filed 09/08/25     Page 6 of 7  \n \n7 \n Evidence of Coverage terms. This Court cannot conceive of a reading of Judge Tunheim’s \nOrders that limited discovery to the named Plaintiffs. \nThe Court has considered the general difficulty and potential drain on judicial \nresources in managing bifurcated discovery in this litigation and determines that the \nadvantages of bifurcation are outweighed by its disadvantages to both the parties and the \nCourt. Simply put, this Court determines that bifurcation would create more problems than \nit would solve in this particular case. \nORDER \nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings \nherein, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Defendants’ Motion to Amend the Pretrial \nScheduling Order (Dkt. 115) is DENIED.   \n \nDated:  September 8, 2025  \n      s/Shannon G.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a trademark dispute between Michael Zaletel, operating under i4software, and Prisma Labs, Inc. Zaletel alleged that Prisma Labs' use of the name \"Prisma\" for their AI-driven app infringed upon his trademark \"Prizmia.\" The court denied Zaletel's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding insufficient likelihood of confusion between the two marks and a failure to demonstrate potential irreparable harm. The case is notable for its discussion on AI, as Prisma Labs' app utilizes artificial intelligence to transform photos into artwork.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Prisma Labs' use of the \"Prisma\" mark constitutes trademark infringement, specifically reverse confusion, against the registered \"Prizmia\" trademark held by Michael Zaletel.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Zaletel had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his trademark infringement claim or that he was likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction. Consequently, the motion for preliminary injunction was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you made a special photo app called \"Prizmia\" and someone else made a super popular app called \"Prisma.\" You said their app name was too close to yours, so people might get confused. You asked the court to make them stop, but the court said, \"Nope, people probably won't get confused, and we don’t think you're really losing anything from it.\" Plus, their app is different because it uses smart computer stuff to change photos into art.

Background. Plaintiff Michael Zaletel, d/b/a i4software (\"plaintiff'), is a \nsoftware developer in North Carolina who operates i4s0ftware as a sole proprietorship \nto develop and market apps for use in the smart phone market. (D.I. 71 at ,.m 2, 4) \nSince 2009, plaintiff has developed over 40 apps for use on Apple iPhones and other \ndevices; at least three have been commercial hits, each generating sales of more than \n$750,000. (Id. at ,.m 6-10; ex. 1) In August 2014, plaintiff launched his \"Prizmia\" app on \nthe Apple App Store; according to plaintiff, the term \"Prizmia\" was coined for trademark \nuse. (Id. at ,.m 11-14) When the \"Prizmia\" app was introduced in 2014, it cost \nconsumers $4.99, a price that was later increased to $7.99. Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 1 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>2. According to plaintiff, he invested 4,900 hours of programmer time valued at \n$367,500 in developing the \"Prizmia\" app. (Id. at 1119) Plaintiff thereafter engaged in \nvarious promotional activities for his app, including marketing and creating a website \n(www.prizmia.com) (Id. at 111120-25; exs. 3-5) Plaintiff asserts that, since August 2014, \nthe \"Prizmia\" app has been downloaded between 15,000 and 20,000 times by \ncustomers, \"most \nof whom paid for it.\" (Id. at 11 51) \n3. Plaintiff is the owner of the federally registered trademark Prizmia®, 1 Reg. No. \n4,682,035, which was registered on the Principal Register by the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark \nOffice (\"PTO\") on February 3, 2015. (Id., ex. 2) According to the PTO's \nrecords, the mark was first used commercially on June 10, 2014 for \" downloadable \nsoftware for use with mobile electronic devices for the purpose of photo and video \ncapturing and editing; downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application for \nphoto and video capturing and editing, in class 9 (U.S. C. 21, 23, 26, 36 and 38).\" (Id.)) \n4. Although plaintiff now describes the \"Prizmia® \" app as \"allow[ing] users to \nmodify photographs or videos with filters that alter the photo's style or add an artistic \neffect\" (D.I. 67 at 3; D.I. 71at1113 ; exs. 3-4), there can be no dispute that plaintiff \nlaunched the \"Prizmia\" app as \"[a]n innovative , feature-loaded app that seamlessly \nconnects to your GoPro\" camera. Indeed, the app was marketed (including on \nplaintiff's Facebook page and promotional YouTube videos) as \"Prizmia for GoPro.\" \n(D.I. 71, ex. 5; D.I. 75, exs. 12-15) More specifically , plaintiff's original webpage from \nAugust 20, 2014 described his commercial product as \"Prizmia for \nGoPro -The Video \n1The court will use the designation \"Prizmia® \" if the document to which the court \nrefers uses that \ndesignation , or when it is otherwise appropriate to do so. \n2 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 2 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>Filters, Photo Effects, Slow Motion, Live Preview and 4K Sharing App for your Go Pro \nCamera.\" (D.I. 75, ex. 13 at 8/8) The marketing material used at its \"worldwide\" launch \ntouted the \"Prizmia\" app as a \"filmmaking app for \nGoPro filmmakers,\" with the most \n\"distinguishing feature\" being \"its full-screen, real-time preview, which can be seen \ndirectly on [an] iPhone, iPad or iPad Touch while filming with \"[a]dditional features\" such \nas \"more than 40 included professional filters and effects, independent color grading \ncontrols for contrast, saturation, gamma and brightness , optical slow motion speed \nadjustment, live filters preview, Direct GoPro media library access and full control over \nall GoPro settings and features.\" (D.I. 71, ex. 5) According to the marketing piece, \nplaintiff claimed that his \"latest achievement , Prizmia for \nGoPro, has been in stealth \ndevelopment for over 18 months with the singular goal of becoming the very best \naccessory for GoPro cameras. \" (Id.) Plaintiff adopted the following logo for his app \nicon in the Apple App Store: \n(f) \nPr1zm1c • •• \n(D.I. 75, ex. 13 at 8/8) \n5. On May 13, 2016, plaintiff pulled the \"Prizmia for GoPro\" app from the Apple \nApp Store due to a complaint from GoPro, which had sent notice to Apple asserting that \nthe \"Prizmia for \nGoPro\" app was infringing GoPro's copyright, trademark and app name. \n(D.I. 78, ex. 19) Plaintiff rebranded the name of his app from \"Prizmia for GoPro\" to \n\"Prizmia,\" and put a new version of the \"Prizmia\" app on the Apple App Store on July \n3 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 3 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>25, 2016. (D.I. 78at1135; ex. 30) The \"Prizmia for GoPro\" app was only downloaded \n47 times in April 2016, and 23 times in May 2016. (D.I. 75at1120) As indicated above, \nthe \"Prizmia\" app was withdrawn from the Apple App Store from May 13 to July 25, \n2016. (D.I. a~1131-36; exs. 26-30; D.I. 74, exs. 2-3) There is no evidence of record \nthat plaintiff's product has ever been a commercial success. \n6. On or about June 11, 2016, defendant Prisma Labs, Inc. (\"defendant\") \nreleased an app on Apple's App Store and later on the Google Play Store for Android \ndevices. The record indicates that defendant was started about a year before the \nPrisma app launched for the purpose of using \"neural networks and artificial intelligence \nto turn a user's photographs into works of art by taking the user's photo and performing \nimage processing to creating a new stylized image that resembles a particular style of \nart.\" (D.I. 74at11112-6) Defendant markets its product as software that uses artificial \nintelligence to \"transform[] your photos and videos into works of art using the styles of \nfamous artists: Van Gogh, Picasso, Levitan, as well as world famous ornaments and \npatterns.\" (Id., ex. 1) Defendant choose the following logo for its app: \n(D.I. 72 at 6) According to defendant , the word \"prisma\" means \"prism\" in Russian. (Id. \nat 11 9) Defendant chose the domain name \"prisma-ai.com \" for its web domain because \nits \"technology uses artificial intelligence to generate modified images.\" (Id. at 1112; ex. \n1) Defendant conducted a trademark search before finalizing the name \"Prisma,\" which \nsearch (according to defendant) did not turn up the \"Prizmia®\" mark. (Id. at 111110-11) \n4 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 4 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>7. Defendant's app has been very successful. In the first two weeks of its \nrelease, it was downloaded about 2 million times. Since then, it has been downloaded \nover 70 million times across the world and over 8 million times in the United States. (Id. \nat 1l1l 17-18) The \"Prisma\" app has been named \"2016 App of the Year\" by both Apple \nand Google Play, and has received substantial praise and publicity from other sources \nas well. (Id. at1l1l 19-21; D.I. 71, exs. 9-13) \n8. On August 31, 2016, after launching a revised \"Prizmia®\" app, plaintiff sent \ndefendant a cease and desist letter; plaintiff initiated the instant lawsuit on September \n29, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (\"EDVA\"). \nPlaintiff filed his motion for a preliminary injunction on November 22, 2016. (D.I. 17) \nFinding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant , EDVA transferred the case to \nthe District of Delaware on or about December 27, 2016. Plaintiff renewed his motion \nfor a preliminary injunction on January 20, 2016. (D.I. 66) Briefing (along with the \nsubmission of various declarations) is complete , and oral argument has been heard. \n9. The parties do not dispute personal jurisdiction , as defendant is a Delaware \ncorporation . The court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a). \nAlthough plaintiff includes in his complaint allegations of unfair competition, in violation \nof 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), the focus of the preliminary injunction motion is trademark \ninfringement. \n10. Standard of review. As explained by the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit, \n[p]reliminary injunctive relief is an \"extraordinary remedy, which should be \ngranted only in limited circumstances .\" ... \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary \ninjunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is \n5 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 5 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that \nthe balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public \ninterest.\" ... The \"failure to establish any element ... renders a preliminary \ninjunction inappropriate.\" ... The movant bears the burden of showing that \nthese four factors weigh in favor of granting the injunction . \nFerring Pharms., Inc. v. Watson Pharmaceuticals , Inc., 765 F.3d 205, 210 (3d Cir. \n2014) (citations omitted). \"[T]he decision whether to grant or deny \ninjunctive relief rests \nwithin the equitable discretion of the district courts, and ... such discretion must be \nexercised consistent with traditional principles of equity.\" eBay Inc. v. MercExchange , \nL.L. C .. 547 U.S. 388, 394 (2006). \n11. Likelihood of success on the merits -trademark infringement. The \nLanham Act defines trademark infringement as use of a mark so similar to that of a \nprior user as to be \"likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\" 15 \nU.S.C. § 1114(1). Plaintiff alleges that he is being damaged under the trademark \ndoctrine of reverse confusion . \"Reverse confusion occurs when a larger, more powerful \ncompany uses the trademark of a smaller, less powerful senior owner and thereby \ncauses likely confusion as to the source of the senior user's goods or services.\" Fisons \nHorticulture , Inc. v. Vigoro Indus., 30 F.3d 466, 474 (3d Cir. 1994). \"Absent reverse \nconfusion, 'a company with a well established trade name and with the economic power \nto advertise extensively [would be immunized from suit] for a product name taken from \na competitor.'\" A & H Sportswear , Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc.,, 237 F.3d 198, \n228 (3d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). Reverse confusion results in the senior user \nlosing the value of its mark, its product and corporate identity, control over its goodwill \nand reputation , and ability to move into new markets. Freedom Card, Inc. v. JP Morgan \n6 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 6 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>Chase & Co., 432 F.3d 463, 471-72 (3d Cir. 2005). According to plaintiff, defendant \n\"has created reverse confusion by distributing its similar app, with a similar name, free \nof charge to 70 million users who might otherwise have purchased [p]laintiff's Prizmia® \napp if not \nfor the infringement.\" (D. I. 67 at 9-10) \n12. Plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence that the doctrine of reverse \nconfusion is applicable to the facts of record. Defendant is a start-up company with one \napp that hit the market in June 2016 without a \"well established trade name\" and with \nno evidence that it had any \"economic power\" other than the strength of its product.2 \nWithout the fundamental premise of the reverse confusion doctrine being proven., that \nis, defendant's status as a \"larger, more powerful company ,\"3 the court declines to take \nthis case out of the traditional analytical framework for trademark cases. \n13. The Third Circuit has adopted the \"Lapp test\" to determine likelihood of \nconfusion in the market. The factors identified in Interpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc., 721 \nF.2d 460 (3d Cir. 1983) (\"the Lapp factors\" include: \n(1) the degree of similarity between the owner's mark and the alleged \ninfringing mark; (2) the strength of the owner's mark; (3) the price of the \ngoods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected \nof consumers when making a purchase ; (4) the length of time the \ndefendant has used the mark without evidence of actual confusion \narising; (5) the intent of the defendant in adopting the mark; (6) the \nevidence of actual confusion ; (7) whether the goods, [even if] not \ncompeting, are marketed through the same channels of trade and \n2Unlike plaintiff, who had developed and marketed multiple successful apps over \nthe course of years prior to launching his \"Prizmia for GoPro\" app. \n3lndeed, plaintiff asserts (in connection with irreparable harm) that \"there is a \nserious question about [d]efendant's ability to pay any judgment .... Prism has existed \nfor less than a year, gives it app away for free, and has presented no evidence that its \napp has generated any revenue.\" (D.I. 67 at 19) \n7 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 7 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>advertised through the same media; (8) the extent to which the targets \nof the parties' sales efforts are the same; (9) the relationship of the \ngoods in the minds of consumers because of the similarity of function; \n(10) other facts suggesting that the consuming public might expect the \nprior owner to manufacture a product in the defendant's market, or that \nhe is unlikely to expand into that market. \nId. at 463. \"'None of these factors is determinative in the likelihood of confusion \nanalysis and each factor must \nbe weighed and balanced one against the other.' ... \n'[T]he different factors may properly be accorded different weights depending on the \nparticular factual setting. A district court should utilize the factors that seem appropriate \nto a given situation.' ... \" Kos Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 709 (3d Cir. \n2004) (citations omitted). \"The Lapp factors are best understood as 'tools to guide a \nqualitative decision.\"' Id. \n14. Degree of similarity (Lapp #1 ). The similarity of the marks is evaluated by \nlooking to the \"sight, sound, and meaning of the marks to determine whether the marks \ncreate the same overall impression when viewed as a consumer .\" A & H Sportswear, \n237 F.3d at 216. Because the test is likelihood of confusion by consumers in the \nmarketplace, the degree of similarity of the marks is assessed by looking at the marks \nas encountered by consumers in the marketplace, keeping in mind that side-by-side \ncomparisons generally are not appropriate.4 See Sabinsa Corp. v. Creative \nCompounds , LLC, 609 F.3d 175, 184 (3d Cir. 2010); A & H Sportswear, 237 F.3d at \n227. It makes sense, therefore, to assess \"the overall impression created by the mark \n4Unless consumers typically view the products side-by-side in the normal \nchannels of commerce. See Int'/ Data Grp., Inc. v. Ziff Davis Media, Inc., 145 F. Supp. \n2d 422, 434 (D. Del. 2001 ). It is possible that a search on the Apple App Store could \nbring these two marks up on the same page, but there has been no evidence of such. \n8 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 8 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>as a whole rather than simply comparing the individual features of the marks.\" Harlem \nWizards Entm't Basketball , Inc. v. NBA Props., Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1084, 1096 (D.N.J. \n1997). \n15. Certainly there is a degree of similarity between the look and sound of the \nwords \"Prizmia\" and \"Prisma.\" However, the marketplace presents the two marks very \ndifferently, which distinct presentations create distinct commercial impressions. The \nicons are very different.5 See Int'/ Data Grp., 145 F. Supp. 2d at 435 (\"[A]lthough there \nare some similarities between the marks at issue in terms of sound and meaning, the \nlook of the logo and the \ntrade dress distinguish CIO Insight from CIO Insider.\"). \nAdditionally, the respective purchase pages on the Apple App Store, from which a \nconsumer would download the parties' apps, create different, distinct impressions. (D.I. \n72 at 2) Further, the source of each of the apps is clearly identified on each of the \npurchase pages., that is, i4software is clearly displayed below the PRIZMIA® name on \nplaintiff's purchase page, and Prisma Labs, Inc. is clearly displayed below the app \nname on defendant's page. (Id.) See Harlem Wizards, 952 F. Supp. at 1096; Schmid \nLabs. v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 482 F. Supp. 14, 18 (D.N.J. 1979). The fact that \nthe PTO found defendant 's \"Prisma\" mark to be confusingly similar to \"PRIZMIA®\" is \nnot dispositive, given the fact that the PTO does not consider evidence of how marks \nare used in the marketplace . See A & H Sportswear , 237 F.3d at 221; Interstate \nBrands Corp. v. McKee Foods Corp., 2000 WL 187204 (T.T.A.B. 2000). The court \n5Notably, defendant's triangle icon connotes a prism, while plaintiff's icon more \nresembles the four rectangles of the GoPro logo. (Compare 0.1. 71, ex. 3 with ex. 6 \nwith D.I. 75, ex. 33) \n9 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 9 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>concludes, therefore, that Lapp factor #1 weighs in favor of defendant. \n16. Strength of \"PRIZMIA®\" mark (Lapp #2). In assessing the strength of a \nmark, the Third Circuit looks to both the conceptual and commercial strength of the \nmark as viewed in the context of the goods for which it is used. Fisons, 30 F.3d at 479. \nAs to conceptual strength, plaintiff's expert concedes that \"[t]he words PRIZMIA and \nPRISMA are both obvious derivatives of the word prism, itself borrowed from the Greek \nwork prisma .... \" (D.I. 68at1110) In this regard, defendant has presented credible \nevidence of the commonly understood meaning of the term \"prism,\" that is, an object \nthat filters light or color, particularly in connection with photography and art. (See, e.g., \nD.I. 75, exs. 2-7, 9-11) Indeed, the term \"prism\" and \"prism\"-derivative names have \nbeen extensively used by third parties for photo-editing apps. (See id., exs. 17-23) \nAside from plaintiff's declaration that in choosing the term \"Prizmia,\" he was \"striv[ing] to \nselect [a] non-descriptive , fanciful term[]\" (D.I. 71 at ,m 12, 14), there is no persuasive \nevidence that plaintiff succeeded in doing so. \n17. With respect to commercial strength, plaintiff concedes that \ndefendant's \n\"Prisma\" mark is \"commercially significantly stronger than [his] Prismia® mark.\" (D.I. 67 \nat 15) There is no evidence to the contrary. As asserted by defendant, \"[t]his is not a \ncase of a senior user being overwhelmed by a junior user. It is a case of a senior user \nthat could not compete in the market before the junior user ever made an appearance .\" \n(D.I. 72 at 13) For all these reasons, Lapp factor #2 weighs in favor of defendant. \n18. Consumer care in purchase (Lapp #3). Lapp factor #3 considers \"the \nprice of the goods and other factors ipdicative of the care and attention expected of \n10 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 10 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>consumers when making a purchase. \" A & H Sportswear , 237 F.3d at 234. As noted \nabove, plaintiff charges $7.99 for the \"Prizmia®\" app; defendant's \"Prisma\" app is free. \nPlaintiff argues that \"[d]efendant's free distribution of its product has fueled the viral \ndistribution of its product to over 70 million users and accelerated injury\" to plaintiff. \n(D.I. 67 at 15-16) Defendant notes that \"[t]he average price of apps in the Apple App \nStore is $1.01 and the majority of apps are available for free .... Consumers of mobile \napps understand the difference between a free app and one that charges Bx the price \nof an average app.\" (D.I. 72 at 15; D.I. 75, ex. 32) The court finds defendant has the \nbetter argument and evidence. Lapp factor #3 weighs in favor of defendant. \n19. Evidence of actual confusion . (Lapp #4 and #6). Evidence of actual \nconfusion is not required to prove likelihood of confusion; however, the lack of actual \nconfusion evidence can lead to an inference that continued use will not lead to \nconsumer confusion . Versa Prods. Co. v. Bifold Co. (Mfg.) Ltd., 50 F.3d 189, 205 (3d \nCir. 1995). Plaintiff offers the following evidence to support his allegations of actual \nconfusion: (1) the monthly Apple Analytics reports for plaintiff's \"Prizmia®\" app, which \nshow \"a dramatic monthly increase\" in the number of consumers who looked at the \n\"Prizmia®\" app and \"a corresponding decrease \" in the number of consumers buying it; \nand (2) one specific incident of a consumer who \"wrongly believed that he had \ndownloaded the Prizmia® app after hearing [plaintiff] pronounce the app name and \ndescribe the app.\" (D.I. 67 at 16) Defendant responds that the statistics demonstrate a \nlack of confusion on consumers ' part, that they have looked at plaintiff's app and made \na choice to download (or not) something other than plaintiff's app. Defendant also \n11 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 11 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>responds that the specific example of confusion provided by plaintiff reflects more a \n\"fleeting uncertainty\" than \"actual confusion.\" See Versa, 50 F.3d at 211. Finally, \ndefendant presented survey evidence that not a single participating consumer confused \nthe two apps at issue. (D.I. 73) On the whole, defendant has the more credible \nreasoning and evidence on these factors. The court concludes that, with at least 70 \nmillion downloads worldwide and a lack of persuasive evidence of actual confusion, \nactual confusion is not likely to occur. Lapp factors #4 and #6 weigh in defendant's \nfavor. \n20. Defendant's intent (Lapp #5). This factor weighs in favor of plaintiff. \nAlthough the record indicates that plaintiff had withdrawn his app from the marketplace \nwhen defendant launched its app, and although there is no evidence that defendant \nadopted its mark \"with the deliberate intent of pushing its rival out of the market,\" A & H \nSportswear, 237 F.3d at 225-26, defendant's assertion that a trademark search did not \nreveal plaintiff's registered mark is not credible. \n21. Competition and overlap (Lapp #7, #8, and #9). At a high level, the parties \nat bar sell similar apps through the same channels of trade. Upon closer inspection, \nhowever, there are distinct differences between the parties' products. In the first \ninstance, the court gives little weight to the fact that both apps are sold on the Internet, \nas that paints too broad a stroke for a trademark \ninfringement analysis in this context \nand with respect to the technology at issue. Moreover, despite plaintiff's description of \nhow a search is conducted on the Apple App Store, a search for plaintiff's \"Prizmia®\" \napp does not turn up defendant's app, and a search for defendant's \"Prisma\" app turns \n12 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 12 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>up numerous additional apps but not plaintiff's. In terms of functionality , this factor is \nsomewhat of a moving target, as plaintiff's app was designed with the \"singular goal of \nbeing the best accessory for \nGoPro cameras,\" but has been touted in this litigation as \nan app that focuses on \"professional and unique filters.\" (D.I. 71 at~ 13 and ex. 3) The \nfocus of defendant 's app has remained unchanged and is fundamentally different in \nfunction; while plaintiff broadly describes both apps as distributing \"photo filtering apps, \nthe record demonstrates that \ndefendant's app analyzes photos using artificial \nintelligence technology and then redraws the photos in a chosen artistic style, resulting \nin machine generated art. Given these very real differences in functionality, it stands to \nreason that the two products are directed to different consumers . Lapp factors #7, #8 \nand #9 weigh in defendant's favor. \n22. Conclusion as to likelihood of success on the merits. Based on the \nabove analysis, the court concludes that plaintiff has not carried his burden to \ndemonstrate that \ndefendant's \"Prisma\" mark is so similar to plaintiff's \"Prizmia® \" mark \nas to likely cause confusion in the marketplace. Therefore , plaintiff has also failed to \ncarry his burden of proving that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his trademark \ninfringement claim. \n23. Irreparable harm. In a Lanham Act case, \"[g]rounds for irreparable injury \ninclude loss of control of reputation , loss of trade, and loss of goodwill.\" Groupe SEB \nUnited States, Inc. v. Euro-Pro Operating LLC, 774 F.3d 192, 204 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(citation omitted). In this regard, plaintiff argues that defendant is a \"larger more \npowerful company \" that has interfered with the value of plaintiff's trademark , even while \n13 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 13 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>defendant is a new company with no revenue. (D.I. 67 at 19) As explained above, the \ncourt has rejected the notion that \ndefendant is a larger, more powerful company; it \nsimply launched a more successful product. There is no evidence of record that \nplaintiff has lost any value in his trademark because of the \"Prisma\" app -neither loss of \ntrade or of goodwill. Plaintiff has not carried his burden in this regard. \n24. Balance of harms. In balancing the equities between the parties, the court \n\"must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each \nparty of granting or withholding the relief requested. \" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). In this case, plaintiff had de minimus sales of his \n\"Prizmia®\" app, both before and after defendant's launch. Unlike the record reflective \nof defendant's app, there is little evidence of any goodwill attributable to the \"Prizmia®\" \napp. (Compare , e.g., D.I. 75, ex. 16 with D.I. 71, exs. 9-13) With respect to the public's \ninterest, although the public certainly has a strong interest in protecting valid \ntrademarks, it also has an interest in promoting innovation . Considering all of the \nabove, the balance of harms weighs in favor of defendant. \n25. Conclusion. Weighing all of the factors discussed above in the totality of \nthe circumstances , see Kos Pharms., 369 F.3d at 711, the court concludes that plaintiff \nhas not carried his burden to demonstrate that the extraordinary remedy of a \npreliminary injunction is warranted on the record presented . Plaintiff's motion is denied. \nAn order \nshall issue. \n14 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 14 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>",

    "summary": "1. Summary: In the case of Nonnie Berg v. United Airlines, the court addressed multiple motions related to procedural defaults and improper use of artificial intelligence in filings. The court granted United Airlines' motion to strike Berg's responses to its motion for summary judgment because they were untimely and improperly employed AI-generated content, including fake legal citations. While not allowing amendments to the complaint, the court gave Berg one final opportunity to correctly respond to the summary judgment motion following proper procedures by a specified date.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the plaintiff's filings, which included AI-generated content with fake legal citations, should be stricken for violating court rules, and whether she should be allowed to amend her complaint at this stage in the litigation.\n\n3. Court’s Holding: The court granted the motion to strike the plaintiff's responses to the summary judgment motion due to procedural violations and improper AI usage. The court denied the motion to amend the complaint due to non-compliance with procedural rules and lack of good cause, ultimately allowing the plaintiff another chance to submit a proper response to the summary judgment motion.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Nonnie Berg tried to submit documents to the court late and used an AI to help write them. The AI gave her fake legal information, making her filings invalid. Because of these mistakes, the court told her to fix them and follow the rules. Otherwise, she could lose her case without being heard. The court also didn't allow her to change her complaint since she didn't follow the rules for doing so, but gave her one last chance to properly respond to an important motion from United Airlines.",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO  \n  \nCivil Action No. 1:23-cv-01766 -NYW -SBP \n \nNONNIE BERG,  \n \nPlaintiff,  \n v. \n UNITED AIRLINES , INC.,  \n \nDefendant.  \n \nORDER AND RECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE  \n \nSusan Prose, United States Magistrate Judge.  \n This matter comes before the court on the following motions: (1) Defendant ’s Motion to \nStrike Plaintiff ’s Responses to Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 91) (“Motion to \nStrike”); (2) Plaintiff ’s Motion for Leave to File Out of Time (ECF No. 99)  (“Motion for \nExtension”) ; (3) two iterations of a “Propose[d] Motion for Leave of Court to Amend Complaint \nand Jury Demand” (ECF Nos. 95, 96) ( together , “Motions to Amend” ); and ( 4) Plaintiff ’s Pro Se \nMotion for Leave to File Corrected Opposition to Summary Judgment (ECF No. 108) (“Motion \nto Correct”).  The undersigned considers these motions pursuant to the Order of Reference (ECF \nNo. 10), the Memoranda referring the motions (ECF Nos. 92, 97, 100, 109), and 28 U.S.C.  § 636(b)(1).  \nThe court has reviewed the motions  and related briefing, the entire docket, and the \napplicable law.  For the reasons set forth below, the court respectfully ORDERS  as follows:  \n(1) the Motion to Strike is granted , and the responses to Defendants ’ Motion for Summary Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 1 of 182 \n Judgment are stricken without prejudice , and the Motion for Extension and Motion to Correct \nare denied  as moot. The court further RECOMMENDS  that the Motions to Amend be denied .1 \nI. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff Nonnie Berg  (“Ms. Berg”) , proceeding pro se, initiated this action on July 12, \n2023, asserting employment discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq ., and 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Second Am. Complt . (ECF No. 37)  \n¶¶ 1-2. On April 21, 2025, Defendant United Airlines, Inc. (“United”) timely filed its Motion for \nSummary Judgment (ECF No. 76). The deadline for Ms.  Berg ’s response to the Motion for \nSummary Judgment was May 12, 2025. ECF No. 81. \nOn May 13, 2025, after the deadline had passed, Ms. Berg filed her first response to the \nMotion for Summary Judgment without requesting, or receiving, leave from the court for her late filing.  ECF No. 85 ( response); ECF No. 84 (exhibits). Ms.  Berg ’s first response is 32 pages long, \nin violation of the 20- page limit in presiding United States District Judge Nina Wang’ s Practice \nStandard 10.1(c)(2). Ms.  Berg did not request or receive leave from the court to exceed the page \nlimit for her response to United ’s Motion for Summary Judgment. \nOn May 14, 2025, Ms.  Berg filed a second belated response to the Motion for Summary \n \n1 “Whether motions to amend are dispositive is an unsettled issue in the 10th Circuit.” Cano-\nRodriguez v.  Adams Cnty.  Sch. Dist.  No. 14, No. 19- cv-01370- CMA -KLM, 2020 WL 6049595, \nat *1 n.2 (D. Colo. July 23, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, 2020 WL 4593219 (D. \nColo. Aug. 11, 2020). “[M]any courts have held that a recommendation to deny a motion  to \namend  . . . should be viewed as a dispositive ruling because it precludes the filing of certain \nclaims .” Crocs,  Inc. v. Effervescent,  Inc., Nos. 06- cv-00605- PAB -KMT, 16- cv-02004- PAB -\nKMET, 2021 WL 941828, at *2 n.1. (D. Colo. Mar. 11, 2021) (quotation omitted). The court \ntherefore assumes, in an abundance of caution, that a recommendation is required and proceeds \naccordingly. Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 2 of 183 \n Judgment, again without requesting or receiving leave from the court for her late filing. ECF No. \n87 (resp onse); ECF No. 86 (exhibits). Ms.  Berg  also did not obtain leave to submit this 33- page \nfiling.  \nOn May 27, 2025, United  filed the Motion to Strike (ECF No. 91), arguing that Ms.  \nBerg ’s responses were untimely, duplicative, and non- compliant with court rules and practice \nstandards. Ms.  Berg ’s opposition to the Motion to Strike (ECF No. 103) was filed on July 8, \n2025, after the June 17, 2025, deadline. United ’s reply (ECF No. 107) highlighted, among other \nissues, that Ms.  Berg ’s opposition contained citations to non- existent cases, apparently generated \nby artificial intelligence.  \nOn June 9 and 10, 2025, Ms. Berg filed the Motions to Amend (ECF Nos. 95, 96), \nseeking to add claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq ., \nbased on allegedly newly -discovered evidence of United ’s knowledge of her disability. United \nfiled a consolidated response in opposition to these motions on July 15, 2025 (ECF No. 106). On June 24, 2025, Ms.  Berg filed the Motion for Extension (ECF No. 99), seeking retroactive \nextensions for her late filings  and citing personal hardships including her husband’ s medical \nissues and a funeral. Finally, on August 5, 2025, Ms.  Berg filed the Motion to Correct (ECF No. \n108), requesting leave to file yet another opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment , \npurportedly to remedy formatting and citation errors.  United  filed its response in opposition to \nthat request on August 26, 2025 (ECF No. 116).  \nThe court addresses the motions , in turn.  \n Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 3 of 184 \n II. ANALYSIS  \nA. Motion to Strike  \nUnited  moves to strike  Ms. Berg ’s two responses to its Motion for Summary Judgment  \n(ECF Nos. 84- 87) because both were filed after the response deadline and without receiving \napproval from the court; for violating Judge Wang ’s practice standards for page limits and for \nresponses to motions for summary judgment; and for improperly using artificial intelligence in \ngenerating the responses. See ECF No. 91 at 1- 2. To be sure, Ms. Berg’ s filings run afoul of all of \nthese rules.  \nTo begin with, Ms.  Berg ’s responses were filed one and two days after the May 12, 2025, \ndeadline established pursuant to the Local Rules of Practice for the District of Colorado,  without \nany contemporaneous request for an extension. See D.C.COLO.LCivR 7.1(d). Moreover, t hese \nuntimely submissions are fundamentally duplicative  in terms of their arguments, and  each \nseparately exceeds the 20 -page limit prescribed by Judge Wang’ s Practice Standard 10.1(c)(2). \nThe responses are also deficient in that they fail to  dispute United ’s statem ent of undisputed \nmaterial facts as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  56(c) and Judge Wang’ s Practice \nStandard 7.1D(b)(4), instead offer ing improper legal arguments without specific references to \nsupporting evidence. See NYW Civ. Practice Standard 7. 1D(d) (stating that failure to follow \nthese procedures may result in the brief being stricken).  \nAn additional, but extremely  critical, problem with these filings , as United  correctly \nobserves , is that significant chunks of Ms. Berg’ s responses were copied and pasted from an \nartificial- intelligence program “with minimal to no revisions” —including “ citation to authorities \nthat are either inapplicable or not binding on the Court because they are from other jurisdictions” Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 4 of 185 \n and “argument that was clearly copied from a brief in another matter.” ECF No. 91 at 6 \n(discussing ECF No. 87 at 6-33) . This cut -and-paste approach has resulted in the wholesale \nomission of any reference to exi sting, relevant authority from the Tenth Circuit. Ms. Berg’ s \nbriefing effectively amounts to a dump of legal citations that have extremely minimal, if any, bearing on her claims.  Notably, even Ms. Berg’s response to the Motion to Strike—which was \nitself untimely filed —reflects the improper use of AI -generated content, including multiple \ncitations to  cases that do not exist. See ECF No. 103 at 4-5 (citing Salt Institute v. Leavitt, 440 F. \nSupp. 2d 240, 243 (D.D.C. 2006); In re Parke- Davis Sec. Litig. , 177 F.R.D. 246, 250 N.6 (E.D. \nMich. 1997); Koch v. Koch Indus., Inc., 203 F.R.D. 479, 487 (D. Kan. 2011) ; Hodgson v. Mason \n& Hangar-Silas Mason Co., 545 F. Supp. 1189, 1192 (D. Kan. 1982); Smith v. Life Investors Ins. Co. of Am., 245 F.R.D. 580, 584 (D. Kan. 2007)).\n2   \n“By presenting to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper—whether by \nsigning, filing, submitting, or later advocating it—an attorney or unrepresented party  certifies \nthat to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry \nreasonable under the circumstances: . . . the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are \nwarranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing \nexisting law or for establishing new law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2). And “[c]ourts across the \ncountry—both within the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit . . . and outside of \nit—recognize that Rule 11 applies to the use of artificial intelligence .” Coomer v. Lindell , No. \n22-cv-01129- NYW -SBP, 2025 WL 1865282, at *3 (D. Colo. July 7, 2025) (collecting cases) . “A \n \n2 The undersigned could not identify these as valid case citations in the Westlaw database utilized \nby the court.

An \nattempt to persuade a court or oppose an adversary by relying on fake opinions is an abuse of the \nadversary system.” Von Neumann v. Wells Fargo Bank N.A ., No. 25- cv-00509- LTB-RTG, 2025 \nWL 2211655, at *2 (D. Colo. Mar. 17, 2025) (quoting Mata v. Avianca, Inc ., 678 F. Supp. 3d \n443, 461 (S.D.N.Y . 2023)).  \nAI-generated citations of the type Ms. Berg has employed undermine the integrity of \ncourt filings and evince a lack of diligence under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). See \nCoomer , 2025 WL 1865282, at *7-8 (sanctioning counsel for misstatements regarding case law, \nincluding “citation of cases that do not exist”). What’s more, they compromise the efficient \noperation of this court by compelling the parties and the judges to examine “law” that has no \nfoundation in reality. Although Ms. Berg proceeds pro se, she is required to comply with the \nsame procedural rules as counseled litigants, including Rule 11, and repeated non- compliance \ncannot be excused. See  Murray v.  City  of Tahlequah, 312 F.3d 1196, 1199 n.2 (10th Cir. 2008) (a \nparty ’s “pros se status does not relieve him of the obligation to comply with procedural rules”)  \nGarrett v. Selby Connor Maddux & Janer , 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005) (observing that the \nTenth Circuit “ha s repeatedly insisted that pro  se parties follow the same rules of procedure that \ngovern other litigants”) (quotation omitted). Furthermore, this court plays a neutral role in the \nlitigation process and cannot assume the role of Ms. Berg’s advocate. Adler  v. Wal-Mart  Stores, \nInc., 144 F.3d 664, 672 (10th Cir. 1998). \nViewing the defects in Ms. Berg ’s filings in  their totality, the court finds that the \nresponses should be stricken. These deficiencies, which “are significant, and not merely Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 6 of 187 \n cosmetic,” prevent United  from fully evaluating and responding to Ms. Berg’s arguments, and \nthey further hamper this court’ s ability to make a reasoned evaluation of the issues. See \nO’Connor v. Lafayette City Council , No. 19- cv-01066- WJM -KLM, 2020 WL 5203792, at *2 (D. \nColo. Sept. 1, 2020) (granting motions to strike where pro se litigant’ s motions violated the \ncourt’s practice standards by failing to provide evidentiary support for factual allegations in \nconnection with a motion for summary judgment and exceeded the page limits prescribed in the \ncourt’s practice standards ). Compliance with procedural rules facilities these purposes, and that is \nwhy even a pro se litigant like Ms. Berg must abide by them or face the striking of her filings. \nBustillo v. Hawk , 44 F. App’x 396, 400 (10th Cir. 2002) (upholding district court’s decision to \nstrike plaintiff ’s response to a motion for summary judgment,” and observing that “[a] pro se \nlitigant must comply with the rules of procedure, including local rules ”) (citing Green  v. Dorrell,  \n969 F.2d 915, 917 (10th Cir. 1992));  Fleming  v. Sims , No. 17- cv-01827-STV, 2017 WL \n10350600, at *1 n.1 (D. Colo. Nov. 2, 2017) (“To the extent Plaintiff intended to file the Motion \nas a Motion for Summary  Judgment, the Court strikes  it for failure to comply  with the local \nrules .

United  Behav.  Health, Inc. , No. 1:15- CV-01164- KWR -JMR, \n2025 WL 1043472, at *1 (D.N.M.

With  deference to Ms. Berg ’s pro \nse status —and recognizing that this is the first time a judicial officer has highlighted the defects \nin her filings—the court finds that Ms. Berg shall be allowed one final opportunity  to re -file a \nresponse to United ’s Motion for Summary Judgment (1) that complies with all of Judge Wang’ s \npractice standards governing briefing on motions for summary judgment, including (but not \nlimited to ) the 20-page limit for response briefs, see Uniform Civil Practice Standard 10.1(c )(2)4; \n(2) that otherwise complies with all applicable procedural rules, including the Local Rules of \nPractice for the United States District Court for the District of Colorado; and (3) that utilizes artificial intelligence, if at all, only in accordance with the strictures  set forth in Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 11 (including, in particular, to avoid all references  to fabricated legal citations) .\n5 \nMs. Berg ’s response to the Motion for Summary Judgment must be filed on or \nbefore September 29, 2025. United ’s reply , if it chooses to file one, shall be due fourteen (14) \ndays after the filing of Ms. Berg’ s response.  In light of this directive, the Motion for Extension \n(ECF No. 99) and Motion to Correct (ECF No. 108) are denied  as moot .  \n \n4 Judge Wang’ s practice standards and the Local Rules of Practice for the District of Colorado  are \navailable on the court’s website: www.cod.uscourts.gov. \n5 The court observes that it has reason to question the veracity of some of Ms. Berg’ s \nrepresentations in ECF No. 108. The appended medical report (ECF No. 108-3) is dated April \n27, 2020—years predating the 2022 events underlying Ms. Berg’ s claims —and contains indicia \nof having been generated by artificial intelligence, including generic, repetitive language, markdown formatting artifacts, and an incomplete physician license number (“License No. CALIFORNIA”) that lacks a verifiable identifier. Searches of California Medical Board records by this court reveal two physicians named “Jeffrey Berman” with valid licenses, see \nhttps://search.dca.ca.gov/results , but none match the details set forth in the alleged medical \nreport.  Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 8 of 189 \n B. Motions to Amend  \n \nOn June 9 and June 10, 2025, Ms. Berg filed two versions of what she styled as a \n“Propose[d] Motion for Leave of Court to Amend Complaint and Jury Demand.” ECF Nos. 95, \n96. United argues that the Motions to Amend should be denied on both procedural and \nsubstantive grounds: Ms. Berg failed to comply with the applicable procedural rules for seeking \nleave to amend, and she has not established good cause for the amendment—which is both \nuntimely and unduly prejudicial to United. See ECF No. 106 at 1-2. For the reasons that follow, \nthe court agrees , on both the procedural and substantive points, and finds that the requested \namendment should be denied. \nTo begin with the procedural deficiencies in Ms. Berg’s filings, Local Rule 15.1 states, in \npertinent part: \nAmendment  or Supplementation by Motion. A party who files an opposed \nmotion for leave to amend or supplement a pleading shall attach as an exhibit  a \ncopy of the proposed amended or supplemental pleading which strikes through \n(e.g., strikes through) the text to be deleted and underlines (e.g., underlines ) the text \nto be added. Unless otherwise ordered, the proposed amended or supplemental \npleading shall not incorporate by reference any part of the preceding pleading, \nincluding exhibits. \n \nD.C.COLO.LCivR 15.1(b) (italics added). To comply with this Local Rule, therefore, Ms. Berg \nwas required to submit, with her motion to amend, a redlined version of her pleading that \ndemonstrates the proposed changes to the operative pleading. She did not do this. Instead, she \nfiled documents that conflate factual assertions with legal arguments. See  ECF Nos. 95, 96. \nThese filings deprive the court of the ability to ascertain the specific amendments Ms. Berg seeks \nto make and prevents it from determining whether leave to amend is justified. The requirements \nof Local Rule 15.1 exist to eliminate such confusion.  Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 9 of 1810 \n Because Ms. Berg did not comply with this Local Rule, the Motions to Amend should be \ndenied. This procedural defect, standing alone, is sufficient justification to deny the Motions to \nAmend. See, e.g., Johnson v.  Giles , No. 20- cv-00037- RM-MEH, 2022 WL 611496, at *2 (D. \nColo. Mar. 2, 2022) (“Although Plaintiff filed the proposed pleading directly on the docket (ECF \n186), he has not provided a copy of the amended pleading containing appropriate strike throughs \nand underlines. The fa ilure to do so violates this District’ s Local Rules and warrants denial of \nPlaintiff ’s Motion.”), report and recommendation adopted, 2023 WL 2446216 (D. Colo. Mar. \n10, 2023); Enow v.  Nat’l Ass ’n of Boards of Pharmacy , No. 17- cv-01645- MSK -SKC, 2019 WL \n6130747, at *3 (D. Colo. Nov. 19, 2019) (finding that, where the plaintiff had “not tendered any \nproposed amended pleading as is required for any motion seeking leave to amend pursuant to \nD.C.COLO.LCivR 15.1(b),” “[t]his alone is a sufficient basis  to deny [his] request to amend”).  \nThe court recognizes that, eventually, Ms. Berg did submit a “Proposed Third Amended \nComplaint and Jury Demand,” ECF No. 110-1, which she appended to her reply brief in support \nof Motions to Amend. ECF No. 110. This, however, is insufficient to repair the procedural \ndefect. As one judge in this District has aptly stated, “[b]y waiting until the reply brief to reveal \nthe proposed amendments, the movant denies their opponent of a reasonable opportunity to be \nheard and, more importantly, deprives the court of well-developed arguments on both sides of the \nissue.” Sturm v. Weber , No. 21- cv-00684- WJM -GPG, 2022 WL 17547808, at *3 (D. Colo. Aug. \n10, 2022) (recommending that motion to amend be denied where the plaintiffs did not attach a \nproposed amended pleading to their motion to amend”).6 Just so here. \n \n6 According to the docket, Sturm  settled before the District Judge evaluated the recommendation.  Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 10 of 1811 \n Even  if Ms. Berg had complied with the Local Rule  governing amendments, the court \nfinds that she has not adequately demonstrated good cause for leave to amend under Rule \n16(b)(4) and, further, that her requests to amend in June 2025—submitted months after discovery \nclosed in March 2025 and after United filed its Motion for Summary Judgment in April 2025—is \nthe product of undue delay and would cause unacceptable prejudice to United. Where the \ndeadline to amend the pleadings pursuant to the scheduling order has passed—here, as it \nhappens, has long passed—the Tenth Circuit has instructed that “a party seeking leave to amend \nmust demonstrate (1) good cause for seeking modification under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) and (2) \nsatisfaction of the Rule 15(a) standard.” Gorsuch, Ltd., B.C.  v. Wells  Fargo Nat. Bank Ass ’n, 771 \nF.3d 1230, 1240-41 (10th Cir. 2014) (“We now hold that parties seeking to amend their \ncomplaints after a scheduling order deadline must establish good cause for doing so.”).  \nRule 16 provides that “a scheduling order may be modified only for good cause and with \nthe judge’s consent.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4). In practice, this standard requires the movant to \nshow that the “scheduling deadlines cannot be met despite [the movant’ s] diligent efforts.” \nPumpco, Inc.  v. Schenker  Int’l, Inc., 204 F.R.D. 667, 668 (D. Colo. 2001) (quotations omitted). \n“Rule 16 ’s good cause requirement may be satisfied, for example, if a plaintiff learns new \ninformation through discovery or if the underlying law has changed.” Beard  v.

As for Rule 15(a), allowing amendment is favored “so long as the moving \nparty has shown, among other things, that the amendment would not cause undue delay, undue \nprejudice to the opposing party, and that it is not sought because of bad faith or dilatory motive.” \nId. (citing Gorsuch, Ltd., B.C., 771 F.3d at 1242; Pumpco Inc. , 204 F.R.D. at 668).  Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 11 of 1812 \n Applying these principles here, the court finds that Ms. Berg has not satisfied the good-\ncause standard of Rule 16(b)(4). Ms. Berg avers that granting leave is warranted based on some \nemails, some of which Ms. Berg herself is a party to (either as the sender or recipient) , and all of \nwhich were produced to her in discovery in this case. ECF No. 95-2 (June 22, 2022 email from \nBerg); ECF No. 95-3 (June 1, 2022 email, bates- labeled  United Airlines, Inc._000992-00993); \nECF No. 95-4 (June 2, 2022 email, bates- labeled  United Airlines, Inc._000988-00990); ECF No. \n95-5 (June 6, 2022 email chain in which Berg is a participant); ECF No. 95-6 (partial copy of \nECF No. 95-5, with a June 10, 2022 date); ECF No. 95-8 (August 3, 2022 email chain, bates-\nlabeled United Airlines, Inc._001012-001013); ECF No. 95-9 (August 17, 2022 email, bates-\nlabeled  United Airlines, Inc._001059). United represents that all of these emails “were produced \nby United on August 14, 2024, which was seven months before the close of fact discovery, over \neight months before the dispositive motion deadline, and nearly ten months before Plaintiff filed \nthe present Motions to Amend.” ECF No. 106 at 8-9; see also  ECF No. 106-1 (August 14, 2024 \nemail to Ms. Berg ’s then counsel from a paralegal at Fisher Phillips, providing a link to \ndocuments bates- labeled United Airlines, Inc._00967-001080).  \nPut simply, none of this is new information. It was known to Ms. Berg, at the latest,  \nseven months before the close of discovery and, in some instances, three years  ago, when she \npersonally participated in several of the email exchanges on which she now bases her  request for \namendment . In light of these facts, Ms. Berg  has failed to meaningfully explain  her delay in \nbringing this information forward. See Husky Ventures,  Inc. v. B55 Invs., Ltd., 911 F.3d 1000, \n1020 (10th Cir. 2018) (explaining that “good cause” “obligates the moving party to provide an \nadequate explanation for any delay,” and concluding that “the district court did not abuse its Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 12 of 1813 \n discretion by refusing to permit amendment at that juncture”) (quotation omitted).  \nMoreover, this purportedly new information lacks any genuine significance when it \ncomes to Ms. Berg ’s claims. The court has reviewed the emails, and there is no mention in any \nof them of any complaint or request made by Ms. Be rg about a disability . See generally ECF \nNos. 95-2 to 95-6, 95-8 to 95-9. Notably, one United employee stated that she had no \nrecollection of Ms. Berg ever mentioning that she had a disability. See ECF No. 95-9. And much  \nof the supposedly new information is in fact already referenced in the Second Amended \nComplaint which, it bears noting, was drafted by an attorney,7 is extremely detailed, and raises \nthe same claims Ms. Berg attempts to plead in her proposed amended pleading. Compare  ECF \nNo. 37 with ECF 110 -1. If anything, the Proposed Third Amended Complaint (which, as \ndiscussed, fails to comply with the procedural mandates of the Local Rules) articulates the facts \nand legal claims with less precision  and clarity  than the operative pleading.  \nIn light of this record, the court concludes that Ms. Berg has not met the  requirements of \nRule 16(b)(4) and that her Motions to Amend must be denied for that reason . See, e.g., Grays  v. \nNavient  Sols., LLC , No. 20- cv-0452- WJM -SKC, 2021 WL 5277146, at *2 (D. Colo. Nov. 12, \n2021) (denying motion to amend where plaintiff “did not identify any new facts discovered after \nthe deadline for amended pleadings”). Because the court concludes that Ms. Berg has failed t o \nsatisfy Rule 16(b)(4), “it need not address whether she satisfied the more lenient standard of Rule \n15(a).” Beard , 2025 WL 1676507, at *3. Nevertheless, in the interest of completeness —and even \n \n7 On October 14, 2024, Ms. Berg’s then-counsel filed a motion seeking leave to withdraw from \nher representation of Ms. Berg “due to irreconcilable differences that have arisen between her \nand the Plaintiff[.]” ECF No. 62 ¶ 2. The court granted that motion on October 23, 2024. ECF \nNo. 64.  Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 13 of 1814 \n though there is a “rough similarity between the ‘good cause’ standard of Rule 16(b) and [the] \n‘undue delay’ analysis under Rule 15,” Minter v. Prime Equip. Co., 451 F.3d 1196, 1205 n.4 \n(10th Cir. 2006)—the court will proceed to evaluate the record pursuant to the Rule 15 standards.  \nLeave to amend a pleading should be “ freely  give[n] . . . when justice so requires.” Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 15(a )(2). But it may be denied in situations where the proposed amendment is the \nresult of undue delay, undue prejudice to the nonmovant, bad faith or a dilatory motive by the \nmovant, or where the proposed amendment is futile. Sinclair Wyo.  Refining  Co. v.  A & B \nBuilders, Ltd., 989 F.3d 747, 777 (10th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted) . “The party contesting the \nmotion to amend has the burden of proving that the amendment should be refused on one of \nthese bases.” Openwater Safety IV,  LLC  v. Great  Lakes  Ins. SE, 435 F. Supp. 3d 1142, 1151 (D. \nColo. 2020), but the court’s focus will be primarily the prejudice to the non-movant that would \nresult from allowing amendment. Sinclair Wyo. Refining Co., 989 F.3d at 777 (citation omitted) . \nUltimately, w hether  to allow  an amendment  rests  in the court’s discretion. Chilcoat v.  San Juan \nCnty. , 41 F.4th 1196, 1217 (10th Cir. 2022).  \n The court finds that United has met its burden to show that the proposed amendment is \nboth unduly delayed and would significantly  prejudice United if allowed. As the court has \nexplained, Ms. Berg was in  possession of the information that precipitated the request for \namendment  months (if not years) before the discovery cut -off. Further, as discussed, it is \napparent that Ms. Berg ’s former counsel took the information into account in drafting the Second \nAmended Complaint, which refers to the more pertinent aspects of this allegedly new data. To \nrewind the clock now with a new pleading would prejudice United by substantially slowing the \nresolution of the matter and compelling United to engage in consequential additional work, Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 14 of 1815 \n perhaps by engaging in additional discovery and certainly by filing a new dispositive motion. \nThere is no reason to invite that delay, and the accompanying prejudice, where Ms. Berg ’s \nclaims are better articulated in the operative complaint8 that has governed the discovery process \nand is now the subject of a motion for summary judgment. See Minter , 451 F.3d at 1205 (“ The \nlonger the delay , the more likely the motion to amend will be denied, as protracted delay, with its \nattendant burdens on the opponent and the court, is itself a sufficient reason for the court to \nwithhold permission to amend.”) (quotation omitted).  \n Accordingly, it is respectfully  recommended that the Motions to Amend (ECF Nos. 95, \n96) be denied . \nC. Failure to Provide Notice of Change of Mailing Address \nQuite recently , between August 19 and August 25, 2025, five pieces of mail sent from the \ncourt to Ms. Berg at  her address of record have been returned and marked  as “undeliverable.” \nSee ECF Nos. 111 -115. Failure to provide a current address is an omission Ms. Berg must rectify \nor face possible dismissal of this action.  \nThe court’ s Local Rules of Practice provide that all unrepresented parties must file a \nnotice of change of mailing address within five days of the date of any such change. See \nD.C.COLO.LCivR 5.1(c). Further, under Local Rule 41.1, \n[a] judicial officer may issue an order to show cause why a case should not be \ndismissed for lack of prosecution or for failure to comply with these rules, the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure, or any court order. If good cause is not shown \nwithin the time  set in the show cause order, a district judge or a magistrate judge \nexercising consent jurisdiction may enter an order of dismissal with or without \nprejudice.  \n \n8 Indeed, it appears to this court that allowing the proposed amendment is likely to prejudice Ms. \nBerg.  Under the circumstances here, there is no justification for incurring that risk. Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 15 of 1816 \n  \nD.C.COLO.LCivR 41.1. Similarly, Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \na court may dismiss a party ’s claims if a party “fails to prosecute or comply with [the Federal \nRules] or a court order.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b). “Although the language of Rule 41(b) requires \nthat the defendant file a motion to dismiss, the Rule has long been interpreted to permit courts to \ndismiss actions sua sponte for a plaintiff’s failure to prosecute or comply with the rules of civil \nprocedure or a court’ s orders.” Strauss v. Steele , No. 20- cv-03464- DDD -MEH, 2022 WL \n3975004, at *2 (D. Colo. Sept. 1, 2022), report and recommendation adopted, 2022 WL \n18278647 (D. Colo. Sept. 30, 2022) (citing Link v.  Wabash R.R.  Co., 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 \n(1962)).  As with all procedural rules, Ms. Berg’s pro se status does not exempt her from \ncomplying with this one. See, e.g., Murray , 312 F.3d at  1199 n.2.  \n In parsing Ms. Berg’s filings for purposes of preparing this Order and Recommendation, \nthe court found a reference to a mailing address at a post office box in Irvine, California. See  \nECF No. 110-1 at 7. If that is Ms. Berg’s address, she has an obligation to comply with the Local \nRule of this court and make that clear. Accordingly, Ms. Berg is ordered  to provide a current \nmailing address (and telephone number, if it is no longer correct on the docket) within ten  (10) \ndays  of the date of this Order and Recommendation. Her failure to do so may result in this \ncourt issuing an Order to Show Cause  why this case should not be dismissed without \nprejudice for failure to comply with court rules . It is apparent from the record that Defendant \nhas suffered actual prejudice as a result of Ms. Berg ’s failure to comply with court rules, and that \njudicial efficiency likewise has been compromised by her non- compliance. With all due respect, \nthe court will not tolerate this continued pattern of conduct. Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 118     filed 09/08/25     USDC Colorado \npg 16 of 1817 \n III. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, first, the court respectfully ORDERS  as follows: \n(1) The Motion to Strike (ECF No. 91) is granted , and the non-compliant responses \n(ECF Nos. 84-87) are stricken without prejudice . Plaintiff shall file a response to the Motion \nfor Summary Judgment (ECF No. 76), in conformity with the directives set forth in this Order, \non or before September 29, 2025. Defendant may file a reply within fourteen (14) days  after \nthe submission of Plaintiff ’s response; \n(2) The Motion for Extension (ECF No. 99) and Motion to Correct (ECF No. 108) are \ndenied as moot ; and  \n(3) Plaintiff must submit to the court an updated mailing address (and telephone \nnumber, if it is no longer correct on the court’ s docket) within ten  (10) days  of the date of this \nOrder and Recommendation. \nSecond, consistent with the analysis set forth herein, the court RECOMMENDS that \nPlaintiff ’s Motions to Amend (ECF Nos. 95, 96) be denied . \nFinally, as a one- time courtesy , this court directs the Clerk of Court to mail this Order \nand Recommendation to Ms. Berg at the following address , which is referenced at ECF No. \n110-1 at 7 : \nNonnie Berg \nP.O. Box 51561 \nIrvine, CA 926199 \n \n9 Rule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that within fourteen (14) days after \nservice of a Magistrate Judge’ s order or recommendation, any party may serve and file written \nobjections with the Clerk of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. 28  U.S.C. \n§§ 636(b)(1)(A), (B); Fed.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this legal case, Jeremy Ryan sued X Corp. (formerly Twitter) for suspending his accounts, claiming promissory fraud, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and unfair business practices. The court dismissed all claims because they were barred by X's terms of service, which allow account suspension and limit liability. Notably, Ryan argued that X used an artificial intelligence (AI) system to target and suspend his accounts without proper user notification, forming part of his claims under unfair business practices.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's claims against X Corp. for suspending his accounts are viable given the Terms of Service and the protection offered by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed all of Ryan’s claims because they are precluded by X Corp's Terms of Service, which permit account suspension and exclude liability for such actions. The court also found that Ryan’s unjust enrichment claim is independently barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a social media account, and the rules you agreed to say the company can remove your account for any reason and won't be responsible for that. In this case, when the company did remove an account, the user tried to sue, saying it wasn't fair and that they broke promises. However, the court said, “Sorry, those rules you agreed to allow this action, so you can't win in court.” The company also used AI to decide which accounts to remove, which wasn't against any law in this instance.",

No. 32  \n \n \nDefendant X Corp., (formerly Twitter, hereafter, “X”) suspended several of plaintiff \nJeremy Ryan’s X accounts last year.  Soon after  that, Ryan filed this action.  Four claims remain: \npromissory fraud, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and an unfair business practice s claim.  \nAs pleaded, all are barred by X’s Terms of Service (the “Terms”), which  limit X’s liability for any \nconduct arising out of users’ inability to access their accounts.  Ryan’s unjust enrichment claim  \nwould also be  barred by section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“section 230”).  \nI will grant X’s motion to dismiss and allow one last opportunity for Ryan to amend his complaint.  \nBACKGROUND  \n The parties are familiar with the factual background of the case .  In the Order Granting \nMotion To Dismiss (“Order”) (Dkt. No. 29), I held that  Ryan’s breach of contract, intentional \ninterference, and conversion claims were barred by section 230  because they “ar[ose] from X’s \ndecision to suspend [Ryan’s] seven accounts and suspension is a traditional publishing function \naccording to the Ninth Circuit.” Dkt. No. 29.  I also dismissed Ryan’s California Business and \nProfessions Code § 17200 (“UCL”) claim to t he extent that it was also predicated on X’s \nsuspension of his accounts  and because it did not allege any economic damages . Id.   \n In his First Amended Complaint (“FAC”) [Dkt. No. 30],  Ryan still alleges that X Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 1 of 13 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  wrongfully suspended his accounts and denied him the opportunity to appeal the suspensions, but \nhe has trimmed and redirected his claims.  His promissory estoppel claim asserts that X did not \nfollow its “multi -pronged suspension policy” when it suspended his accounts.  FAC , ¶¶ 91 -94.  He \nalleges that he “did not violate X’s Terms, policies, or rules,” but that his accounts were \nnevertheless suspended “without any proper explanation.”  Id. ¶¶ 46, 82.  He also claims that X \nused an artificial intelligence sys tem to target, identify, and suspend his account, something which \nit did not disclose to its users.  Id.  His unjust enrichment claim stems  from the same facts; he \nalleges that because X suspended his accounts in the manner he describes, the revenue it generates \nfrom advertisements that still run alongside  or are associated with his now -unavailable content is \nrevenue wrongly obtained.  Id.   \nRyan’s promissory fraud claim asserts that X promised (through its Terms, representations \nmade in its “Help Center” and media commentary by Elon Musk) not to suspend accounts without \ncause but failed to adhere to those promises . Id. ¶¶ 113, 118.  His UCL claim a lleges  that X \n“engaged in unfair business practices by using an artificial intelligence system to identify, target, \nand suspend user accounts without providing proper notice in its Terms and allowing this system \nto suspend accounts for any reason at all,” by “represent[ing] to users and Plaintiff . . . that it \nabides by a multi -pronged suspension policy” despite allegedly “never publiciz[ing] the provision \nof its Terms stating that the company may suspend accounts for any reason,” and by representing \nthat Plaintiff could “submit an appeal” with respect to the suspension of his accounts.  See id. ¶¶ \n124, 126 -27.   \n X has moved once again to dismiss all of Ryan’s claims. Motion to Dismiss (“Motion”) \n[Dkt. No. 32].   \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nA motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) “tests the legal \nsufficiency of a claim. A claim may be dismissed only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff \ncan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle hi m to relief.” Cook v. \nBrewer , 637 F.3d 1002, 1004 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Rule 8 \nprovides that a complaint must contain a “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 2 of 13 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Thus, a complaint must plead “enough facts to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 \n(2007). Plausibility does not mean probability, but it requires “more than a sheer possibility that a \ndefendant has acted unlawfully.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 687 (2009). A complaint must \ntherefore provide a defendant with “fair notice” of the claims against it and the grounds for relief. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (quotations and citation omitted).  \nIn considering a motion to dismiss, the court accepts factual allegations in the complaint as \ntrue and construes the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Manzarek v. \nSt. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co ., 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. 2008); Erickson v. Pardus , 551 \nU.S. 89, 93 -94 (2007). However, “the tenet that a court must accept a complaint's allegations as \ntrue is inapplicable to threadbare recitals of a cause of action's elements, supported by mere \nconclusory statements.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. If a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is granted, the “court \nshould grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it \ndetermines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.” Lopez v. \nSmith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (citations and quotations omitted). However, \na court “may exercise its discretion to deny leave to amend due to ‘undue delay, bad faith or \ndilatory motive on part of the movant, repeated failure to cure defi ciencies by amendments \npreviously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party ..., [and] futility of amendment.’ ” \nCarvalho v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC , 629 F.3d 876, 892 –93 (9th Cir. 2010) (alterations in \noriginal) (quoting Foman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)).  \nDISCUSSION  \nI. X’S TERMS OF SERVICE BAR RYAN’S CLAIMS  \nAll of Ryan’s claims are barred by  the Terms , which provide that the platform may stop \nproviding its services to users for any or no reason.  Ryan concedes  that the Terms, which are a \npart of X’s User Agreement, are a legally binding contract to which he  is a party .  See FAC ¶¶ 76, \n78, 105 -06, 125.  But he notes that  the limitation of liability clause does not bar claims for fraud or \ngross negligence.  While that is true, that does not help him  because he has not plausibly alleged \neither.  Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 3 of 13 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  A. The Terms  \nX’s Terms of Service (the “Terms”) provide, in relevant part:  \nWe may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services or any features within the \nServices to you or to users generally. We also retain the right to create limits on use and \nstorage at our sole discretion at any time. We may also remove or refuse to distribute any \nContent on the Services, limit distribution or visibility of any Content on the service, suspend \nor terminate users, and reclaim usernames without liability to you  . . .  \n \n. . . [X] [s]hall not be liable  for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive \ndamages, or any loss of profits or revenues . . . resulting from” the user’s “inability to access \nor use the services . \nX’s Request for Judicial Notice [Dkt. No. 33 -2] Ex. A (“X Terms”) at pp. 3 -6 (emphasis added).1  \nThis liability limitation applies to “any theory of liability, whether based on . . . contract, statute, \ntort . . . or otherwise.” Id.  California courts regularly recognize limitation of liability clauses as \nvalid.  See e.g. , Lewis v. YouTube, LLC , 244 Cal. App. 4th 118 (2015); Food Safety Net Services v. \nEco Safe Systems USA, Inc. , 209 Cal. App. 4th 1118 (2012).2   \nB. X Has Limited  its Liability for Ryan’s Claims  \nAll of Ryan’s claims arise from his inability to access X’s services after it suspended his \naccounts .  His promissory estoppel claim seeks damages for what he says were false promises  that \nX made to him about how it would handle account suspension; he alleges that X made “specific, \npersonal promises” that it would not suspend his “access” to his accounts but did anyway.   FAC ¶¶ \n46-51, 85 -89.  His unjust enrichment claim seeks recovery of advertising revenue that X \npurportedly obtained through its continued use  of Ryan’s accounts after their suspension.  See id. \n¶¶ 106 -109.  His promissory fraud claim seeks damages for what he describes as X’s \nmisrepresentations about its appeals process to get his accounts unsuspended.  See id. ¶¶ 113 -15, \n119.  And h is UCL claim seeks damages for X’s retention of “a financial benefit” from Ryan’s \naccounts’ suspension and his loss of prospective economic advantages.  See id. ¶¶ 128 -29; see \nMotion 8 -10; X Reply [Dkt. No. 38] 1 -2; Terms at p. 6.   \n \n1 X has asked that I take judicial notice of its Terms. Dkt. No. 33 -2.  Ryan does not oppose.  The \ncontents of the Terms are not subject to reasonable dispute  and the defendant’s Request for \nJudicial Notice is GRANTED.  \n \n2 These clauses have been specifically recognized as appropriate where one party is offering a \nservice for free to the public, as is the situation here.  See e.g. , Lewis , 244 Cal. App. 4th at 125 \n(citing Marksborough  California, Inc. v. Superior Court , 227 Cal. App. 3d 705 (1991)).  Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 4 of 13 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Ryan points out that California courts find limitation of liability provisions unenforceable \nunder California Civil Code section 1668 to the extent that those provisions insulate a party from \nfraud or gross negligence.  See Opposition to X’s Motion to Dismiss (“Oppo.”) [Dkt. No. 37] 18 -\n19 (citing City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court , (“Santa Barbara ”) 41 Cal. 4th 747 (2007)).  \nOnly one of his four claims, for promissory fraud, alleges fraud or gross negligence.  He argues \nthat section 1668 precludes X fr om limiting its liability against that claim because it involves a \n“standard above negligence .”  Id.  But even in that claim, he  has failed to plausibly allege fraud.  \n1. Section 1668   \nSection 1668 provides: “All contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to \nexempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud . . . or violation of law, whether willful or \nnegligent, are against the policy of the law.” Cal. Civ. Code § 1668.  California courts have \nrepeatedly interpreted the statute as rendering  limitation of liability unenforceable to the extent \nthat they would insulate an individual or entity  from liability for fraud or willful injury. See e.g., \nWeBoost Media S.R.L. v.  LookSmart Ltd. , No. C 13 –5304 SC, 2014 WL 2621465, at *9 –10 (N.D. \nCal. June 12, 2014) ; New England Country -Foods, LLC v. Vanlaw Food Products, Inc. , 87 F.4th \n1016, 1019 -20 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nThe Ninth Circuit provided a helpful overview of section 1668 law in New England \nCountry Foods :  \nThe California Supreme Court has held that provisions exculpating all  liability for \n“intentional wrongdoing” and “gross negligence” are invalid under Section 1668.  See \nWestlake Cmty. Hosp. v. Superior Ct. , 17 Cal. 3d 465, 479, 131 Cal.Rptr. 90, 551 P.2d 410 \n(1976) (holding that a bylaw that “bar[red] ... plaintiff's claim based on the intentional  \nwrongdoing of the hospital or its staff” was invalid under Section 1668 (emphasis in \noriginal)); City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Ct. , 41 Cal. 4th 747, 751, 62 Ca l.Rptr.3d 527, \n161 P.3d 1095 (2007) (holding “that an agreement made in the context of sports or \nrecreational programs or services, purporting to release liability for future gross negligence, \ngenerally is unenforceable as a matter of public policy”).   Accordingly, Section 1668 will \n“invalidate[ ] contracts that purport to exempt an individual or entity from liability for future \nintentional wrongs,” “gross negligence,” and “ordinary negligence when the public interest \nis involved or ... a statute express ly forbids it.”  Spencer S. Busby, APLC v. BACTES Imaging \nSols., LLC , 74 Cal. App. 5th 71, 84, 289 Cal.Rptr.3d 100 (2022) (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Frittelli, Inc. v. 350 N. Canon Drive, LP , 202 Cal. App. 4th 35, 43, 135 \nCal.Rptr.3d 761 (2011)).  \n87 F.4th at 1019 -20.   Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 5 of 13 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  In Santa Barbara , the court  considered the effect of section 1668 on a contractual \nprovision that sought to release the City of Santa Barbara (the “City”), from liability for future \ngross negligence .  See Santa Barbara , 41 Cal. 4th 747 (2007).  The mother of a developmentally \ndisabled 14 -year-old girl  had signed an application form that released the City from liability for \n“any negligent act” related to the child’s participation in the City’s summer camp for \ndevelopmentally disabled children.  Her daughter drowned while attending the camp and the \nparents sued the City.   The California Court of Appeal held that “(1) the agreement in the \napplication form was effective and enforceable insofar as it concerned defendants’ liability for \nfuture ordinary negligence , but (2) the release of liability clause for future gross negligence  was \nunenforceable.”  Id. at 751 (emphasis added).  On appeal, the Supreme Court of California \naffirmed the second conclusion.3  \nSince Santa Barbara , other California courts have considered the appropriate scope of \nliability -limiting clauses like the one at issue here and held that section 1668 renders liability \nwaivers unenforceable to the extent that those waivers would insulate a party from fraud , \nintentional tort liability, 4 or gross negligence .  See e.g. , WeBoost Media , 2014 WL 2621465, at \n*9-10.  Where  there are no plausible allegations of fraud , intentional tort liability, or gross \nnegligence , the constraint is inapplicable.  See e.g. , Block Scientific, Inc. v. True Diagnostics, Inc. , \n2022 WL 485010, at *9 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 16, 2022) (holding that section 1668 does not render a \nlimitation of liability provision unenforceable where the plaintiff “has not satisfied the heightened \npleading requirements of fraud” and “has not adequately all eged that Defendants violated the \nlaw”).  \n \n3 The Santa Barbara court noted that no published California case as of 2007 had upheld (or \nvoided) an agreement that purported to release liability for future gross negligence, only \n“ordinary” or “simple” negligence, making the issue before it one of first impression.  In th e \nabsence of California authority on the issue at the time, the court turned to other jurisdictions, and \nfound that the “vast majority of decisions . . . [held] that such agreements,” i.e. those that waive \nfuture liability for gross negligence, “generally are void on the ground that public policy precludes \nenforcement of a release that would shelter aggravated misconduct.” See id. at 760 (collecting \nnon-California cases).  The Santa Barbara court followed th at analysis . \n \n4 Notably, Ryan did allege intentional torts in his first complaint —he alleged intentional \ninterference with his economic advantage and conversion —but I dismissed those claims without \nleave to amend because they were barred by section 230.  Dkt. No. 29.  Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 6 of 13 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2. Ryan Has Not Plausibly  Alleged Fraud  \nIf Ryan had plausibly alleged fraud, X’s limitation of liability clause  might not apply  to his \npromissory fraud claim .  He has not  done so .   \nThe elements of a promissory fraud claim are (1) “a promise clear and unambiguous in its \nterms” (2) that is false; (3) “that the promisor know of the falsity when making the promise;” (4) \n“reliance by the party to whom the promise is made” (5) that is “bot h reasonable and foreseeable;” \nand (6) resulting injury. Aceves v. U.S. Bank, N.A. , 192 Cal. App. 4th 218, 225, 231 (2011).   Under  \nRule 9(b), parties must “allege fraud with particularity,” including the “who, what, when, where, \nand how of the misconduct charged.”  See Coronavirus Rep. v. Apple, Inc ., 85 F.4th 948, 958 (9th \nCir. 2023).   \nThe FAC does not allege  a “promise” by X to not suspend Ryan’s accounts , despite  Ryan’ s \ncontentions in his briefs and at the hearing .  See Oppo. 23 -24.  Ryan  does not allege when these \nsupposed representations were made .  He simply  asserts that  “X’s . . . executives and agents have \nmade numerous general and specific representations that [X] will not be overly active in its \nsuspension of user accounts.” FAC ¶¶ 11, 112 -115; Oppo. 23 -24.  He offers statements by Elon \nMusk that the platform will be a “‘common d igital town square,’” X’s “Freedom of Speech, Not \nReach” policy, and “repeated statements by corporate executives that the company will not bad \n[sic] user accounts for reasons contrary to its Terms.”  Oppo. 23 -24; FAC ¶¶ 11, 15.  These \ngeneralized allegations are far from “clear and unambiguous” promises not to suspend Ryan’s \naccounts.  And they do not come close to meeting the Rule 9(b) particularity standard.5, 6   \n \n5 The closest that Ryan comes to alleging fraud with particularity is his allegation that on \nDecember 19, 2023, X emailed him explaining that one of his accounts associated with the handle \n“@nftdemon_420” had been mistakenly  suspended, and X was “unsuspend[ing]” it, see FAC ¶ 47.  \nX did “unsuspend” that account, but later suspended it again in April 2024.  FAC ¶¶ 49 -50.  Ryan \nargues that this representation indicated to him that he would be allowed back on the X platform \nbecause he had not violated its Terms .  But he never alleges how X represented to him that it \nwould not suspend his accounts in the first place or that he would be allowed back on X \nindefinitely . \n \n6 Ryan also alleges that “X never represented to [Ryan] . . . that it used artificial intelligence \nsystems to target, identify, and suspend user accounts,” FAC ¶ 114, but does not allege how or \nwhy this would constitute fraud.  No  cited  authority suggests that a social media platform using an \nAI system to identify accounts for suspension qualifies as a fraudulent practice.  \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 7 of 13 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Finally, Ryan’s claim that he “resumed his activities . . . under the representation that his \ncompliance with [X’s] Terms of Service and adherence to the rules of the platform would allow \nhim to continue creating content, building his business, and engaging with th e cryptocurrency and \nNFT community” is conclusory  and contradicted by X’s Terms.  See FAC ¶¶ 50 -51.  He provides \nno indication of when, how, where, or in what context X represented to him that so long as he \ncomplied with  its Terms and “adhere[ed] to the rules of the platform” he could continue using his \naccounts indefinitely and without interruption.  Any such representation would have been out -of-\nstep with the Terms.  \n*** \nTaking all pleaded facts as true, Ryan does not plausibly allege the kind of conduct  that \nwould render X’s limitation of liability unenforceable under section 1668.  The Terms anticipate \nand release X from liability for claims like Ryan’s that seek “indirect, incidental, special, \nconsequential or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues . . . resulting from” the user’s \n“inability to access or use the servic es.”   \nII. SECTION 230  \nWhile Ryan’s claims are all barred by the Terms, which warrants  their dismissal, his unjust \nenrichment claim would also be  barred by Section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency \nAct.7  \nTo invoke section 230 as an affirmative defense at the pleading stage, X must show that \nRyan’s allegations establish beyond dispute that: (1) that X is a “provider . . . of an interactive \ncomputer service”; (2) that the challenged content is “information pr ovided by another  \ninformation content  provider”; and (3) that Ryan’s claims “treat” X as the “publisher or speaker” \nof that information. See Calise v. Meta Platforms, Inc ., 103 F.4th 732 (9th Cir. 2024) (laying out \nthe elements of the test for section 230 immunity as iterated by the Ninth Circuit in Barnes v. \n \n7 X argues that section 230 bars all of Ryan’s claims, but I disagree.  His claims for promissory \nfraud and estoppel and his UCL claim are implausibly alleged, but they seek to hold X liable for \nwhat Ryan interpreted as promises to treat his accounts in a particular way; those purported \npromises are distinct from X’s publishing conduct.   \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 8 of 13 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Yahoo! , Inc., 570 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir. 2009), the “ Barnes  test”) (emphasis added).  \nPreviously , I could not ascertain whether Ryan’s unjust enrichment claim was subject to \nsection 230 because the pleadings were unclear.  See Order  at 15 -16.  I directed Ryan to amend his \ncomplaint to clarify.  According to the FAC, X is wrongfully deriving and retaining a benefit from \nRyan’s intellectual property because it still generates advertising revenue from ads that continue to \nrun alongside  Ryan’s suspended accounts  even though  Ryan cannot himself access his accounts or \nthe content they hosted .  FAC  ¶¶ 103 -111.  He contends that this revenue is wrongfully gotten.8  \nFAC ¶¶ 105 -110.   \nAt its heart, Ryan’s unjust enrichment claim  attempts to hold X liable for decisions it made \nas a publisher  and is accordingly barred by section 230.  X decided to suspend Ryan’s accounts (a \npublishing activity) and it continues to allow various entities  to advertise on its platform (also a \npublishing activity).  This claim  does not attempt to hold X liable for alleged misrepresentations or \nfalse promises.  Ryan does not assert  that X promised him that it would not continue to generate \nad revenue from adver tisements associated with his suspended accounts —he merely challenges its \ndecision to do so.  See FAC ¶¶ 103 -111.   \nRyan argu es that section 230 generally does not apply to  any of his claims, both because \nhe says that his claims arise from “X’s unlawful activity embedded in its inconsistent Terms . . . \nand conflicting statements,” rather than from its publishing activity per se, and also because he \nbelieves that X’s use of an AI system to suspend accounts takes it outside the scope of section 230 \nprotection.  See Oppo. 9 -10.  Neither argument  holds water.  \nA. The Second Barnes Element is Met for All Claims  \nThere is no dispute that the first Barnes  element is met: X is a provider of an interactive \n \n8 Ryan alleges that since he filed his opposition to X’s first motion to dismiss, X has “taken \nremedial steps to change this function on the X platform,” Oppo. 22:16 -18.  At oral argument, \nRyan’s lawyer  clarified that she was referencing new provisions in X’s updated Terms that \ninvolved its use of artificial intelligence systems.  See Dkt. No. 37 -2 (Ryan’s Request for Judicial \nNotice of X’s updated Terms).  I grant Ryan’s  request for judicial notice  (there appears to be no \ndispute a bout the legitimacy of the new Terms ), but they have no effect on my analysis .  The \nprovision that Ryan ’s counsel pointed to  at oral argument merely states  that X has the right to use \ninformation that its users provide  to train its machine learning and artificial intelligence models \nwithout compensation to the user.  Id. at pp. 7, 21.  \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 9 of 13 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  computer service.  The second Barnes element was  also uncontested the first time around ; all of \nRyan’s claims hold X liable for decisions it made regarding “information provided by another \ninformation content provider,” i.e. information that Ryan , not X, provided. See Barnes , 570 F.3d at \n1109 (finding that the removal of social media content falls under section 230(c)(1)); see also \nKing v. Facebook, Inc ., 572 F. Supp. 3d 776, 780 -81 (N.D. Cal. 2021) (finding that claims relating \nto disabling of accounts fal l under section 230(c)(1)); First Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. No. 13]; \nOpposition to First Motion to Dismiss [Dkt. No. 26].   \nBut n ow Ryan argues that section 230 immunity “only applies if the interactive computer \nservice provider is not also a ‘information content provider’.” Oppo. 10:12 -19.  He s ays that \n“section 230 does not immunize X . . . from its own unlawful activity and therefore does not bar \n[his] claims,” see id. 10:8 -12:28, and argues that because X “is responsible in whole or in part” for \ncreating or developing content (the nature of which he does not specify), it is also an “information \ncontent provider” as defined b y 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(3) and is therefore not immune under section \n230(c)(1).9   \nI do not fully understand this argument, but I think that Ryan may be contending that \nbecause he alleges that the “challenged activity” (i.e. X’s suspending of his accounts) may have \nbeen taken “entirely by another information content provider,” meaning X’s AI system , he has \nshown a dispute a bout whether the challenged content is provided by “another” information \ncontent provider .  If my interpretation is right, Ryan misunderst ands X’s burden in establishing a \nsection 230 defense .  He  conflat es the second Barnes element, which considers the source of the \ncontent at issue, and the third Barnes element, which considers whether the challenged action was \nundertaken in the actor’s role as a publisher or speaker.  \nNothing in the FAC allows me to infer that X (or anyone other than Ryan) provided the \ninformation on Ryan’s pages.  The FAC does allege at various points that something other than X \n \n9 That subsection defines “information content provider” as “a ny person or entity that is \nresponsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development of information provided through \nthe Internet or any other interactive computer service. ” 47 U.S.C. § 230(f)(3).   \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 10 of 13 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  (its AI systems) could have made the decision to suspend Ryan’s accounts.10  (This argument \nmakes no sense to me; if X uses its AI system, it is still X’s ultimate decision that is at issue.)  \nRegardless, that has no bearing on the second Barnes element.  Whether X or its AI system or \nsome combination thereof made the decision to suspend Ryan’s accounts, the content at issue on \nthose accounts was content provided by “another ” information content provider other  than X or its \nAI system: Ryan.  The second Barnes element is met with respect to all claims.  \nB. The Third Barnes Element is Met for Ryan’s Unjust Enrichment Claim  \nRyan offers two reasons why his claims generally do not seek to impose liability for \n“publishing” activity and thus do not meet the third Barnes element.  First, he argues that “[w]hile \nsection 230 can provide immunity to interactive service providers, it does not provide immunity to \ngenerative artificial intelligence models or systems deployed by interactive service providers.” \nOppo. 13.  Second, he argues that all four of his remaining claims are based on some kind of \nindependent “promise” that X made to him, not on its decision to suspend his account s, and thus \nare not subject to section 230.  Id. 9.  The first argument lacks foundation .  The second is not \napplicable to his unjust enrichment claim.  \n1. X’s Use of AI Systems  \nFirst, no  authority suggests that X’s use of a generative AI model to do content regulation \ndeprives it of section 230 immunity.  Nothing  in the plain language of the statute  suggests that X \nwould be denied section 230 protection because it uses an AI system for content moderation. See \ngenerally , 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1).  No court has held otherwise.   \nRealizing this, Ryan turns to an unenacted Congressional bill that proposed modifications \nto section 230.  See Oppo. 14 -15 (referencing Senator Josh Hawley’s proposed “No Section 230 \nImmunity for AI” Act, which sought to amend the Communications Decency Act such that \n \n10 Ryan alleges that the AI system operated outside of X’s control to suspend his accounts, based \non its own “machine learning capabilities and ability to form independent behaviors and actions”, \nsee Oppo. 14:9 -12.  He goes on to argue that X “has not demonstrated that there can be no dispute \n… that X’s actions were related to content produced by another information content provider and \nnot its own behavior or that its contributions are entirely unrela ted to the aspect of the conduct \n[that] was allegedly unlawful.” Id.   \n Case 3:24-cv-03553-WHO     Document 41     Filed 12/09/24     Page 11 of 13 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “nothing in this section . . . shall be construed to impair or limit any claim in a civil action . . . \nbrought under Federal or State law against the provider of an interactive computer service if the \nconduct underlying the claim or charge involves the use or provision of generative artificia l \nintelligence by the interactive computer service.”); see supra n. 6.  An unenacted bill has no \npersuasive power here.  Ryan has offered no authority that suggests section 230 protections are to \nbe rescinded from interactive computer services that use AI systems to moderate content.  X’s \ndecision to suspend —and its act of suspending —Ryan ’s accounts was publishing activity that falls \nwithin the scope of section 230.11 \n2. Misleading Representations  \nRyan’s unjust enrichment claim fundamentally challenges X’s decision to suspend his \naccounts, which is a publishing activity, and its continued collection of ad revenue associated with \nthose accounts.   The Ninth Circuit has held that any activity that “can be boiled down to deciding \nwhether to exclude material that third parties seek to post online ,” i.e. publishing conduct,  “is \nperforce immune under section 230.” Roommates.Com , 521 F.3d at 1162 -63, 1170 -71; see also \nBarnes , at 1107 (quoting Roommates.Com ).   \nAs indicated supra , n.7, Ryan’s claims for promissory fraud and estoppel and his UCL \nclaim do challenge something other than publishing conduct, albeit  unsuccessfully : They \nchallenge X’s alleged misrepresentations.  But his  unjust enrichment claim does not allege that X \npromised  that it would cease all advertising activity connected to his accounts in the event that it \nsuspended those accounts .  See discussion supra , Section I(B).  It alleges that X’s decision to \ncontinue publishing ads connected to his accounts was wrongful, and its retention of associated \nrevenue is unjust.  This claim challenges X’s publishing activity.  It is barred by section 230.  \n \n11 X also points out that the United States Supreme Court recently contemplated social media \nplatforms’ use of “algorithms” to implement community guidelines and standards, including to \ntake down content that violates those guidelines and standards.  See Moody v. NetChoice , 144 S. \nCt. 2383 (2024) (considering whether a Florida statute that limited social media platforms’ \ncapacities to engage in content moderation violated the First Amendment).  But the majority \nopinion in Moody did not contemplate the use of artificial intelligence systems  to regulate content, \nwhich is what Ryan alleges X is using, so Moody is not helpful here.  Justices Alito, Thomas, and \nGorsuch, concurring, noted that social media platforms will increasingly use AI systems to \narrange, delete, and modify content.  But no substantive guidance came from Moody  on this \nquestion.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a trademark dispute between Playground AI LLC and Mighty Computing, Inc., both operating in the artificial intelligence sector, over the use of the \"Playground AI\" mark. Playground AI alleges trademark infringement and cybersquatting against Mighty and its founder, Suhail Doshi, arguing that Mighty launched an aggressive campaign using the contested trademark despite knowing its prior use by Playground AI. The court denied Doshi's motion to dismiss, allowing the claims against him to proceed because there are plausible allegations of his personal involvement in the corporate actions. \n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Suhail Doshi, as a corporate officer, can be held personally liable for trademark infringement and cybersquatting allegedly committed by Mighty Computing, given his significant control and involvement in the company's business activities.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Playground AI provided sufficient factual allegations to state a plausible claim for personal liability against Doshi for trademark infringement and cybersquatting. Doshi's motion to dismiss the First Amended Complaint was denied because he is allegedly the central figure in the company's decision-making, especially regarding the trademark issues at hand.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine two kids — let's call them Paul and Mike — both set up lemonade stands with the name \"Yummy Lemonade.\" Paul believes he was the first to use the name and sues Mike, saying Mike stole it to trick people into thinking his lemonade is Paul's.

The court says, \"We think there's enough reason to believe Mike's dad was part of the plan, so we should keep looking into it,\" and refuses to dismiss the case just because Mike's dad says he had nothing to do with it.",

Both companies assert  rights in the mark “Playground AI” and variations  of that \nmark .  Playground AI filed this suit against Mighty and its founder, Suhail Doshi (“Doshi”), \nasserting claims under two federal statutes,  the Lanham Act  and the Anti-Cybersquatting \nConsumer Protection Act .  Mighty  answered and filed counterclaims against Playground AI and \nits founder, Rick Latona (“Lato na”), asserting a Lanham Act  claim  and related state law  claims . \n All parties have answered except Doshi, who moves to dismiss Playground AI’s operative \nfirst amended complaint (“FAC”) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).   Doshi  argues \nthat he cannot be held liable for Mighty’s  alleged trademark infringement and cybersquatting  \nbased solely on his role as a corporate officer , and  contends  that the FAC does not  sufficiently \nallege his personal involvement in Mighty’s  alleged wrongd oing to state a claim against him .  The \nCourt finds the motion suitable for decision without oral argument, and therefore the motion \nhearing set for April 25, 2024 is VACATED.   See Civ. L.R. 7 -1(b).

BACKGROUND1 \n Playground AI is a company specializing in artificial intelligence software , and “[i]ts \nwebsite is a ‘one -stop’ location for a variety of generative AI tools and models .”  FAC ¶ 1 , ECF \n15.  Both “AI” and “playground” are  generic terms commonly used in the AI field :  “AI refers to \n‘artificial intelligence, ’ while playground refers to an application or platform  where users can \nsafely experiment, test, learn, or play with various tools and algorithms. ”  Id. ¶ 3.  “However, \nPlayground AI’s inverted word order, in which playground is a  noun -adjunct  modifying AI, \ncreates a distinctive composite ” that has been in continual use by  Playground AI and its \npredecessors in interest since December 2019.  Id. ¶¶ 4-5.  The “Playground AI” mark and \nvariations of the mark have been used in connection with Playground AI’s goods and services \nrelating to artificial intelligence, including “(i) ‘Anonymous Camera, ’ a popular and well -\npublicized  application for investigative journa lists and political activists, which uses AI to identify  \npeople in images and videos; blur, pixelate, or block identifying features in real time; and  strip \nmetadata from the resulting file; and (ii) ‘Worklens, ’ a mobile application that uses  AI to analyze,  \nlabel, group, and search photos based on content. ”  Id. ¶¶ 5-6. \n Mighty  is a technology company founded by Doshi  in 2019 .  See FAC ¶¶ 7-8.  The \ncompany is a closely held  corporation with approximately ten employees , which is run from \nDoshi’s home.  See id.  ¶ 7.  Mighty’s Statement of Information filed with the California Secretary \nof State lists “Doshi as the sole officer of the company, simultaneously holding the key positions \nof ‘Chief Executive Officer, ’ ‘Chief F inancial Officer ’ and ‘Secretary. ’”  Id. ¶ 82.   Doshi “ has \npersonally participated in all major business  strategy, branding, and marketing decisions and \nactions ” of Mighty.  Id.  \n In September 2022, Mighty launched a website at <playgroundai.com> with the  title \n“Playground AI,” and shortly thereafter Mighty deployed an application with text -to-image and \nimage search  features on its website .  See FAC ¶ 9.  In November 2022, Mighty filed an intent to \n \n1 The facts alleged in the FAC are accepted as true for purposes of evaluating Doshi’s Rule \n12(b)(6) motion.  See Reese v.

Mighty \nnonetheless registered for the Twitter/X handle of “ @playground_ai ,” and “ funded an aggressive \nmarketing and litigation campaign against  Playground AI in the hopes of overwhelming and \nbullying the company out of its rights  and domain name. ”  Id. ¶¶ 11 -15.  In September 2023, \nMighty filed an complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization (“WIPO ”) pursuant \nto its Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (“UDRP ”), alleging that Mighty  has \ncommon law rights in the domain name <playground .ai> and that Playground AI has no rights in \nthe domain name.  See id.  ¶ 13.   Mighty dismissed the UDRP complaint without prejudice on \nOctober 11, 2023.  See id.  ¶ 16.  \n Playground AI filed the present action on October 11, 2023.  See Compl., ECF 1.  The \nfollowing day, Mighty  began changing some of its branding from “Playground AI” to \n“Playground.”  FAC ¶ 18.  However, Mighty continues to use “Playground AI,” “playgroundai,” \nand similar variations on Mighty’s website.  Id. ¶¶ 19 -24.  Playground AI alleges that “ Mighty \nbuilt its business and brand by infringing on the Playground AI  Marks.  It attracted customers, \nattention, and, upon information and belief, new funding,  by lever aging the good will, publicity, \nand consumer recognition already associated with  the Playground AI Marks in the AI software \nspace. ”  Id. ¶ 23.  Playground AI filed the operative FAC on November 14, 2023, asserting claims \nagainst Mighty and Doshi for:  (1) False Association and Designation of Origin  under the Lanham \nAct, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a) ; and (2) Cybersquatting  under the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer \nProtection Act , 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d) . \n Mighty answered the FAC, and filed counterclaims against Playground A I and its founder, \nLatona.  Doshi filed the present motion to dismiss , arguing that the FAC does not state a claim \nagainst him because it does not allege facts showing his personal involvement in the claimed \ntrademark infringement and cybersquatting.  \n Case 5:23-cv-05181-BLF     Document 42     Filed 03/14/24     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California    II. LEGAL STANDARD  \n “A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted tests the legal sufficiency of a claim.”  Conservation Force \nv. Salazar , 646 F.3d 1240, 1241 -42 (9th Cir. 2 011) ( internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \nWhile a complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, it “must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iq bal, \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  \n When evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the district court is limited to the allegations of \nthe complaint, documents incorporated into the complaint by reference , and matters which are \nsubject to judicial notice.  See Louisiana Mun. Police Employees ’ Ret. Sys. v. Wynn , 829 F.3d \n1048, 1063 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd. , 551 U.S. 308, 322 \n(2007)).  The Court need not “accept as  true allegations that contradict matters properly subject to \njudicial notice” or “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or \nunreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \n  III. DISCUSSION  \n Doshi contends that the FAC does not allege facts sufficient to give rise to personal \nliability against him for Mighty’s alleged trademark infringement and cybersquatting.  In \nopposition, Playground AI argues that the claims against Doshi are adequately alleged because the \nFAC makes clear that Doshi controls Mighty and is involved in all significant corporate decisions.   \nIn the event the Court does not find the allegations o f the FAC to be adequate, Playground AI \nrequests leave to amend and proffers additional facts that could be alleged with respect to Doshi.   \n “[A] corporate officer or director is, in general, personally liable for all torts which he \nauthorizes or directs o r in which he participates, notwithstanding that he acted as an agent of the \ncorporation and not on his own behalf .”  Comm. for Idaho’s High Desert, Inc. v. Yost , 92 F.3d \n814, 823 (9th Cir. 1996)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Ninth Circuit has \nexpressly applied this principle to trademark infringement actions.  See id.  at 823 -24.   “ Cases \nfinding personal liability on the part of corporate officers have typically involved instances where Case 5:23-cv-05181-BLF     Document 42     Filed 03/14/24     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the defendant was the ‘guiding spirit’ behind the wrongful conduct, or the ‘central figure’ in the \nchallenged corporate activity.”   Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc. , 844 F.3d 1058, 1069 (9th \nCir. 2016)  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “ At the motion to dismiss stage, courts \nhave  found a plausible basis for personal liability when the plaintiffs have alleged that the officer \nexercises sufficient control over the corporation with respect to the challenged activity. ”  DISH \nNetwork L.L.C. v. Jadoo TV, Inc. , No. 20 -CV-01891 -CRB, 2020 WL 5816579, at *4 (N.D. Cal. \nSept. 30, 2020) .  \n Here, the FAC alleges that “ Doshi is the founder and central figure  of Mighty Computing, \nInc., and has personally participated in all major business strategy,  branding, and marketing \ndecisions and actions. ”  FAC ¶ 82.  Those allegations are supported by the following facts:  Doshi \nfounded Mighty; Mighty is a closely held  corporation with approximately ten employees ; the \ncorporation is operated from Doshi’s home; and the corporation’s Statement of Information f iled \nwith the California Secretary of State lists Doshi as the sole officer of the company, holding the \npositions of CEO, CFO, and Secretary.  Id.  The FAC contains screen shots of Doshi’s social \nmedia posts announcing  transition of Mighty’s branding from “Playground AI” to “Playground” \nand opining that the company’s use of “Playground” was “Trademark clear.”  Id. ¶¶ 118 -121.  \nFinally, the FAC alleges that af ter the present lawsuit was filed, Doshi direct messaged \nPlayground AI’s founder Latona to ask if he wanted to “find  a more peaceful resolution. ”  Id. ¶ \n123.  The Court finds that these allegations give rise to a plausible basis for personal liability \nagainst Doshi based on his exercise of control over Mighty with respect to the alleged trademark \ninfringement and cybersquatting.  \n Doshi  argues that the FAC’s allegations are too general to give rise to personal liability \nagainst him, relying on In re JUUL La bs, Inc., Mktg., Sales Pracs., & Prod. Liab. Litig. , 497 F. \nSupp. 3d 552  (N.D. Cal. 2020) .  In JUUL , the district court found allegations regarding certain \ncorporate officers’ direct involvement in youth -targeted marketing to be sufficient to give rise to \npersonal liability under California’s Unfair Competition Law, but found more general allegations \nthat certain directors had “final say” in marketing materials to be insufficient for personal liability.  \nSee id.  at 635 -36.  Doshi argues that the FAC’s alleg ations against him are similar to those found Case 5:23-cv-05181-BLF     Document 42     Filed 03/14/24     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  inadequate in JUUL .  Doshi’s reliance on JUUL is misplaced.  He is not merely a board member \nalleged to have final say in marketing decisions, but rather an individual alleged to have founded \nMighty, to hold every significant corporate office, to run the corporation out of his home, and to \nbe someone who personally announces corporate rebranding and initiates negotiations re garding \ntrademark litigation.   The Court finds these allegations sufficient to assert personal liability against \nDoshi for pleading purposes.  \n The Court observes that even if it were to grant Doshi’s motion  to dismiss , it would grant \nleave to amend based on Playground’s  representation  that it could add additional allegations \nregarding Doshi’s status as a central figure in the alleged trademark infringement.  Playground \nsubmits the declaration of its counsel, Brett E. Lewis, containing screen shots of several of \nDoshi’s social media pos ts.  See Lewis Decl., ECF 31 -1.  In one, Doshi teased a big corporate \nannouncement and, when asked whether the board was involved, replied “i am the board and i am \ndefinitely involved.”  Id. ¶ 4.  The following day, he posted a thread introducing “Playgrou nd v2.”  \nId. ¶ 5.  The addition of allegations regarding Doshi’s personal involvement in the alleged \ntrademark infringement based on these social media posts would bolster Playground AI’s claims \nof personal liability .  However, the Court concludes that it need not require amendment of \nPlayground AI’s pleading to add such allegations (and thus potentially invite another round of \nmotion practice), because the FAC is adequate as pled.  \n Doshi’s motion to dismiss the FAC is DENIED.  \n  IV. ORDER  \n (1) Defendant Dos hi’s motion to dismiss the FAC is DENIED; and  \n (2) This order terminates ECF 20.  \n \nDated:   March 14, 2024  \n ______________________________________  \nBETH LABSON FREEMAN  \nUnited States District Judge  \nCase 5:23-cv-05181-BLF     Document 42     Filed 03/14/24     Page 6 of 6",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, the United States District Court for the Southern District of California denied the plaintiff, Lance Black's motion to conduct depositions using a videographer named Casey Stark who would use Zoom AI Companion for real-time voice recognition transcription. The court found that while AI-assisted transcription might be cost-effective, it raised privacy concerns and did not meet the standards of using a certified court reporter, lacking in professional oversight and compliance with the protective order regarding confidential information.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff is allowed to conduct depositions using real-time voice recognition technology provided by an AI platform, replacing traditional certified stenographers, and have the resulting transcripts certified and used in legal proceedings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the plaintiff’s motion to use AI-assisted transcription for the deposition process, citing concerns over privacy, the lack of formal certification and training of the videographer as a deposition officer, and the potential violation of the protective order concerning confidential information.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you want to record conversations at your friend's big party and use a new computer program that hears and types everything for you, so you don't have to write it down. But your friend doesn't trust this new program because it's not clear who can see the recorded chats, and it might miss important parts of the conversation. Plus, only people with special training should do this type of job. The court decided it's safer to stick with traditional methods for now to make sure everything is done right and securely.",

Factual Background  \nOn November 27, 2021, Plaintiff commenced this civil rights action against the City \nof San Diego, San Diego Police Department, San Diego County, the San Diego Sherriff’s Department, and a number of individual officers (“ the Officer Defendants”).  (ECF No. 1.)  \nOn March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative complaint, the Third Amended Complaint, \nagainst the City of San Diego and the Officer Defendants (collectively, “Defendants”) .  \n(ECF No. 76 (“TAC”).)  The TAC contains the following causes of action: assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, trespass to chattels, invasion of privacy, computer fraud and abuse, negligence, violation of Cal. Civil Code § 52.1(a), violation of Cal. Civil Code § 51.7, violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, including false \narrest, equal protection and due process, excessive force, unreasonable search, retaliation, and Monell  claims based on official policy and custom and failure to train.  (TAC at 46 –\n95.) \nB.  Background of Instant Motion   \nDuring the Court’s March 21, 2025, Status Conference, Plaintiff’s counsel stated his \nintent to file the instant motion.  (ECF No. 149.)  Plaintiff then filed the present Motion on March 27, 2025.  (ECF No. 153.)   The City of San Diego and the Officer Defendants \nopposed.  (ECF No s. 160 , 162. )  On April 2, 2025, the Court informed Defendants that the \nlink provided to the City of San Diego’s Information Technology Policy on Artificial Intelligence and Generative Artificial Intelligence Policy in their opposition required authorization and ordered Defendants to file the policy  as a supplement to their opposition .  \n(ECF No 163.)  T hey immediately did so.  (ECF No. 164.)  Plaintiff filed a reply on \nApril  2, 2025.  (ECF No. 165.)  Additionally, on April 2, 2025, the Court ordered Plaintiff Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 2 of 8 \n3 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 to file a supplement which identified a sampling of cases in which Casey Stark acted as a \ndeposition videographer in federal courts in California.  (ECF No. 166.)  A Status \nConference was held on April  2, 2025, to discuss the Motion .  (ECF No. 168.)  During the \nStatus Conference, Defendants were ordered to supplement their opposition to include any additional information for the Court’s consideration.  (ECF No. 169.)  Plaintiff filed a \nsecond supplemental declaration of Casey Stark  on April 4, 2025 (ECF No. 170) , and \nDefendants filed their second supplement to their opposition on April 9, 2025 (ECF No. 171).   \nPlaintiff seeks leave to conduct depositions in this action before Casey Stark, who is \na Notary Public and Videographer, and for  an order approving the use of transcripts of \nthose depositions, which would initially be generated by  the real-time voice recognition \nsoftware Zoom AI Companion and subsequently reviewed, revised (as necessary ), and \ncertified by Mr. Stark, for all purposes, including motions practice  and trial.  (ECF Nos. \n153 at 1 –2; 165 at 2.)   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n The Court has broad authority to manage the discovery process under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 26, which expressly allows the Court to enter orders to manage \ndiscovery to avoid undue burden and expenses.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1).  Fe deral Rule of \nCivil Procedure  30 governs the procedure by which depositions are taken by oral \nexamination and imposes certain requirements.   Specifically, “[a] party who wants to \ndepose a person by oral questions must give reasonable written notice to ever y other party.”   \nFed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(1).   “The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the \nmethod for recording the testimony.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(3)(A).  “Unless the court orders \notherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. ”  Id. \n“[A] deposition must be conducted before an officer appointed or designated under \nRule 28,” u nless the parties stipulate otherwise.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(5)(A).  “Within the \nUnited States, . . . a deposition must be taken before: (A) an officer authorized to administer \noaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or (B) a person Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 3 of 8 \n4 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 appointed by the court where the action is pending to administer oaths and take testimony.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 28(a)(1).  The officer must “certify in writing that the witness was duly \nsworn and that the deposition accurately records the witness's testimony.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n30(f)(1).   Notably, the existence of confidential materials, “propels the task of videotaping \na deposition beyond a simple task to a complicated one.”  Schoolcraft v. City of New York , \n296 F.R.D. 231, 2 40 (S.D.N.Y.  Nov. 21,  2013) . \nThe noticing party must bear costs of recording the deposition.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n30(b)(3)(A).   Moreover, while “ [p]laintiff ’s in forma pauperis  status entitles him to a \nwaiver of the filing fee and free service of process by United States Marshals . . . it does \nnot entitle him to waiver of witness fees, mileage or deposition officer fe es.”  Jackson v. \nWoodford , No. CIV 05CV0513- L NLS, 2007 WL 2580566, at *1 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2007) \n(citing 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a) and Tedder v. Odel , 890 F.2d 210, 211 (9th Cir. 1989)).    \nIII.  DISCUSSION   \n Plaintiff requests that the Court approve Casey Stark “to act as a deposition officer ,” \nthat the remaining depositions be “ recorded by Voice Recognition Technology, ” that Mr. \nStark be able to “certify the transcripts of the depositions he has presided over ,” and that \nthose transcripts “ so properly certifi ed be admissible for the purposes of motions, \ncompliance with Rule 26, and usable at trial.”  (ECF No. 153 at 4.)  \n Plaintiff contends that “there is no requirement” that “grants a monopoly to certified \nstenographers to prepare transcripts of proceedings in federal court.”  ( Id. at 2.)  Plaintiff \nasserts that financial barriers limit his access to a traditional certified stenographic court \nreporter because Plaintiff is “essentially indigent ,” so Plaintiff’s counsel has been \nadvancing litigation expenses  and there are at least thirteen more depositions  to be taken .  \n(Id. at 3, 5.)   For the four depositions already conducted, Plaintiff’s counsel estimates the \naverage cost was approximately  $4,000  apiece.  ( Id. at 5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel has \ncontracted with Mr. Stark, a professional legal videographer who holds a Notary Public \ncommission,  at an estimated rate of about $1,455 per seven- hour deposition, inclusive of \ntranscript and exhibits.   (Id . at 6 –7.)  Plaintiff argues that Mr. Stark is an experie nced Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 4 of 8 \n5 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 professional legal videographer, court reporters already utilize artificial intelligence (“AI”)  \ntools to assist in transcription, and Mr. Stark will be proofreading and personally certifying \nthe transcript produced by the Zoom AI Companion as a verbatim recording which is “the \nsame function and objective as a shorthand reporter.”  (ECF No. 165 at 1 –2.)   \n Defendants do not oppose Mr. Stark acting as a videographer or deposition officer, \nbut rather oppose Mr. Stark utilizing the Zoom AI Companion to create a transcript of the \ndeposition and then certifying the transcript without having the necessary qualific ations  of \na court reporter.  (ECF No. 171 at 1.)  Defendants argue  that allowing  AI tools access to \nsensitive, confidential information raise s privacy and data protection concerns .  (ECF No s. \n160 at 2; 171 at 2.)  Defendants contend that the City of San Diego ’s Information \nTechnology Policy on Artificial Intelligence and Generative Artificial Intelligence Policy “prohibit s submission of any sensitive, confidential, regulated, or [personal identifying \ninformation] to generative AI technology platforms without appropriate internal controls and processes.”  (ECF Nos. 160 at 2; 164 at 9.)  Defendants also argue that the Protective \nOrder (ECF Nos. 32, 156) issued in this case do es not allow for confidential information \nsuch as police personnel files and confidential internal affairs investigations to be provided \nto a third- party AI platform .  (ECF No s. 160 at 2; 171 at 2 .)  Defendants further argue that \nMr. Stark is not qualified to certify a transcript, and they express the concern that a \n“recording and AI transc ription will not accurately capture” nuances that “certified court \nreporters (or transcriptionists) are trained to handle and have experience handling.”  (ECF No. 171 at 3.)  Defendants assert that a certified court reporter or transcriptionist should be \nused.  ( Id. at 1–2.) \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to utilize Mr. \nStark in the capacity of deposition officer/transcriptionist .  \nFirst, the Court notes that while Mr. Stark is a professional legal videographer , he \nhas not served as a d eposition officer before.  (ECF No. 170 at 2.)  Although  Mr. Stark \nasserts that he is planning to take the Certified Deposition Reporter (“CDR”) exam, he has \nnot yet passed the exam.  (Id . at 4.)  Moreover, as Defendan ts point out,   passing the CDR Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 5 of 8 \n6 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 exam would allow Mr. Stark  “to capture[] the record by digitally recording depositions” \nbut it would “not allow him to certify a transcript.”  (ECF No. 171 at 2 .)  To certify \ntranscripts on e must have a  Certified Electronic T ranscriber Certificate.  (Id .)  As other \ncourts have  noted , court reporters and videographers typically have different roles in a \ndeposition  and require different certifications and/or training .  See  Alcorn v. City of \nChicago , 336 F.R.D. 440, 443 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 20, 2020) (“The court reporter in this case \nwho will stenographically record and transcribe the deposition has declined to certify the \naccuracy of the Zoom recording as it is not his function. Rather, it is a certified videographer who has the appropriate training[.] ”)). \n Next, although Plaintiff contends that Mr. Stark will be proofreading the material \nproduced by the Zoom AI Companion and will personally be certifying the transcript as a verbatim recording (ECF No. 165 at 2) , as Defendants  highlight, a court reporter’s role is \nmore complex and nuanced than that.  For example, c ourt reporters have additional duties \nand responsibilities during the course of the deposition, such as reminding participants to \nnot speak over one another, clarif ying names, acronyms, and other unfamiliar terminology , \nand requesting the spelling of names and words, all with the goal of having a clear record.  \n(ECF No. 171 at 3.)  The Court agrees that a recording plu s AI transcription does not fulfill \nall the roles t hat court reporters are trained in and have experience handling.  Mr. Stark \nasserts that the Zoom AI Companion allows him to make real- time modifications and \n“train” the program while the testimony is being given.  (ECF No. 153 -1 at 2.)  However, \nthis practice is untested in a real-life deposition setting and could lead to unanticipated \ndelays and problems .  In addition, a s Defendants assert, if a party has a problem with a \ncourt reporter’s services, there is “some oversight, regulation, and a complaint process” \n(ECF No. 171 at 2), but Mr. Stark is not overseen by a licensing agency to whom \nDefendants can turn with complaints.   Although Mr. Stark may well possess, or could \nacquire, the skills  that a court reporter brings to bear, he has not been for mally trained in \nthe duties of a court reporter , he has not been certified, and he does not yet have experience Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 6 of 8 \n7 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 serving as a deposition officer.1 \n Furthermore, the Court finds that Defendants have expressed legitimate concerns \nabout giving Zoom’s AI platform access to sensitive, confidential information.  Plaintiff \nargues that the Zoom AI Companion does not use any “customer  content ” to train Zoom \nand its AI models.  (ECF No. 165 at 2.)  In making this assertion, Plaintiff relies on the \nfollowing  language from Zoom’s website :  \n“Data from users’ interactions with the AI Companion features may be \naccessed, processed, and used by Zoom to provide and maintain the services, troubleshoot issues, and provide support.  Zoom does not use any of your \naudio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments or other communications-like customer content (such as poll results, whiteboard and reactions) to train Zoom’s or its third- party artificial intelligence models.  This commitment  \nincludes the content mentioned in the chart above, such as audio transcripts, \nused to provide the service.”  \n \n \n(Id.)  However, it is not clear from this disclaimer how the data will be “accessed, \nprocessed, and used by Zoom to provide and maintain [] services, troubleshoot is sues, and \nprovide support.”  ( Id.)  Defendants  contend  that the Zoom AI Companion uses “ third-\nparty artificial intelligence models provided by unknown subprocessors, ” and it is no t \nknown if the data is stored or how it is stored.  (ECF No. 171 at 2 .)  This is especially \ntroubling in the instant case , as discovery and probable  deposition questions  involve \nconfidential material including personnel f iles and internal affairs investigations.   (ECF \nNo. 160 at 2.)   The Court finds that providing information designated as \n“CONFIDENTIAL” or “CONFIDENTIAL  – FOR COUNSEL ONLY” in the Protective \nOrder (ECF No. 156) to a third-party platform , especially when it is not transparent how \n/// \n \n1  This is not to say that Mr. Stark, or someone else with his experience and \nskills, aided by AI transcription software, would not be an appropriate deposition officer in a different case.  For all of the reasons addressed in this order, though, this is not the \nright case.  Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 7 of 8 \n8 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 the information will be stored and used, violates the Protective Order  and is not justified in \nthis case .  \n The Court finally notes that, generally, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow \neach party in a case to take a total of ten depositions, limited to one day of seven hours  \neach.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2)(A)(i); 30(d)(1).   Here, Plaintiff has conducted \ndepositions of four individuals and is opting to take at least thirteen  more.  (ECF No. 153 \nat 5.)  Plaintiff has argued  that th e Motion  should be granted because taking depositions in \nthe traditional manner is very expensive, but Plaintiff has not demonstrated that taki ng this \nmany depositions is necessary for the prosecution of his claims.    \nBecause the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to conduct depositions utilizing  Casey \nStark  as the creator and certifier of the transcripts, the Court need not address the aspect of \nthe Motion requesting an order approving the use of such transcripts for purposes of \nmotions practice and trial.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff ’s Motion  is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  May 2, 2025   \n \n \nCase 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 8 of 8",
