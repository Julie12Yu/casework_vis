The court holds that the term \u201cexpert system(s)\u201d in the \u2019392 patent refers to a computer program that includes: (1) a database module with information pertinent to assessing operator impairment; (2) a decision module for applying logic to screen and control the equipment; and (3) an interface module connecting with equipment and operators.",
