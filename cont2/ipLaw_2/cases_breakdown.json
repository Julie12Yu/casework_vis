The complaint asserts that the AI training process involved copying entire books into OpenAI\u2019s systems so that the models could learn patterns of language and generate human\u2011like text. Plaintiffs claim that this use of their works to train AI constitutes direct copyright infringement and supports an unfair competition claim under California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law. The court\u2019s order on the motion to dismiss repeatedly refers to ChatGPT and OpenAI\u2019s AI language models, analyzing whether the ingestion of copyrighted books to train these AI systems, and the subsequent operation of those systems, can give rise to liability for direct copyright infringement and unfair business practices. The court ultimately allows the direct copyright infringement claim tied to AI training and use to proceed, and finds that the alleged use of copyrighted books to build and commercialize AI models may support a claim under the \u201cunfair\u201d prong of the UCL, while dismissing other AI\u2011related theories such as vicarious infringement, DMCA violations, negligence, and unjust enrichment with leave to amend.",

The court granted summary judgment in favor of Anthropic, finding that using the books to train the AI was transformative and constituted fair use under Section 107 of the Copyright Act\u2026 The main legal issue is whether Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its AI models constitutes 'fair use' under Section 107 of the Copyright Act, particularly considering the books were acquired, in part, through piracy and were used to develop a highly profitable AI service. The court held that the use of the books to train AI models was a fair use due to its transformative nature, as the AI was creating novel outputs and not directly competing with the authors' works\u2026 Imagine Anthropic is like a giant robotic student that reads a lot of books to learn how to write like humans.
