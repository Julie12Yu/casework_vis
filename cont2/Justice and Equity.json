    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of Logan v. The Paul Revere Life Insurance Company and Unum Group Corp., the court found in favor of the plaintiff, John Robert Logan, who challenged the denial of his long-term disability (LTD) benefits under an employer-sponsored plan governed by ERISA. The court determined that Logan was indeed disabled under the policy, primarily due to his cardiac condition, and Unum's decision to terminate his benefits was incorrect. Although the case involved a company that utilizes AI-driven visual monitoring solutions, AI/automation was not directly involved in the legal issues or the court's holding.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Unum correctly terminated John Robert Logan's long-term disability benefits under the ERISA-governed policy, based on his claimed disability from his cardiac condition and other health issues.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that Logan was disabled under the terms of the policy due to his cardiac condition, supported by medical and vocational evidence. The decision to terminate his benefits was incorrect, and the court ordered Unum to reinstate his benefits retroactively.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have insurance that covers you if you get too sick to work. John, who was very sick, told the insurance company he couldn't do his job anymore. The insurance company said he was okay, but John disagreed and went to court. The court looked at all the evidence — including what doctors said and tests that were done — and decided that John was right and should get his benefits back, meaning the insurance should continue to help him because he can't work like he used to.",

Plaintiff seeks judicial review of Unum’s d ecision to deny hi s claim for long-\nterm disability (“LTD”) benefits under an em ployer-sponsored disability  plan pursuant to the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 101 et seq.  (“ERISA”). The Court \nhas reviewed the administrative record, made specifics findings of fact, and articulated \nconclusions of law. For reasons that fo llow, Plaintiff’s Motion [Doc. 25] will be  GRANTED .   \nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThe parties agree that the plan documents do no t include a valid grant of discretion to the \nplan administrator, so the de novo  standard of review applies. [Doc . 25 at 17; Doc. 29 at 20]. In \nthis context, the Court’s role “is to determin e whether the administrator . . . made a correct \ndecision.” Hoover v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co. , 290 F.3d 801, 808–09 (6th Cir. 2002). \nThe Court’s review is confined to the reco rd that was before the plan administrator. Wilkins v. \nBaptist Healthcare Sys., Inc. , 150 F.3d 609, 615 (6th Cir. 1998). \n To prevail on a claim for disability benefi ts under ERISA, a plaintiff must prove by a \npreponderance of the evidence that he was “dis abled” within the m eaning of the policy. Javery v. \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 1 of 36     PageID\n#: <pageID> \n2 Lucent Techs., Inc. , 741 F.3d 686, 700 (6th Cir. 2014). De novo  review requires the Court to take \na “fresh look” at the administrative record, “givi ng proper weight to each  expert’s opinion in \naccordance with supporting medical tests and underlying objective findings, and according no deference or presumption of correctness” to  the decisions of th e plan administrator. Id. (cleaned \nup).  \nII. FACTS \n Plaintiff applied for LTD benefits on May 2, 2019. Unum initially approved Plaintiff’s \napplication for benefits on September 27, 2019, and pa id LTD benefits to Pl aintiff until March 12, \n2021, finding that he no longer had any restric tions and/or limitations  preventing him from \nperforming his duties on a full-time  basis. Plaintiff subsequently  appealed the decision twice, \narguing that Unum did not properly identify the demands of hi s occupation or the effects of his \ndisabilities. Despite new eviden ce submitted by Plaintif f, Unum ultimately upheld its denial. A \ndetailed description of his medica l records and claim process follows. \na. Background  \n John Robert Logan is the former President and Chief Executive Officer of Osprey \nInformatics located in Calgary, Alberta. [ER 2204].\n1 Osprey Informatics (now Osperity, Inc.) is a \nsoftware company founded in 2012 that develops  and provides cloud-based, artificial intelligence-\ndriven visual monitoring solutions for industrial operations in North America. [ Id.]. Defendant \nPaul Revere Life Insurance Company, a who lly owned subsidiary of Unum Group Corp., \n(collectively “Unum”) is the underwriter of  LTD insurance policies numbers 0102644597 and \n0102755854 (collectively “The Policy’),  issued to Plaintiff via hi s former employer. [ER 277, \n303]. The Policy defines disability as follows: \n \n1 For ease of reference, the administrative record is cited as “ER,” referring to the dig its following Bates stamp UA-\nCL-LTD, filed as Docs. 21, 21-1, 21-2, 21-3, 21-4, and 21-5. \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 2 of 36     PageID\n#: <pageID> \n3 An individual is totally disabled when Paul Revere determines that because of \ninjury or sickness:   \n- You are unable to perform the important  duties of Your Occupation; and  \n- You are receiving Physician’s Care. We  will waive this requirement if We \nreceive written proof acceptable to Us that further Physician's Care would be \nof no benefit to You.  \n \n[ER 282, 309].   \n“YOUR OCCUPATION”  means the occupation or oc cupations in which You are \nregularly engaged at the time Disability begins. \n  “RESIDUAL DISABILITY” , prior to the Commencement Date, means that due \nto Injury or Sickness which begins prior to age 65:  \n \na. (1) You are unable to perform one or more of the important duties of Your \nOccupation; or  \n(2) You are unable to perform the important duties of Your Occupation for \nmore than 80% of the time normally  required to perform them; and  \n \nb. You are receiving Physician’s Care. We  will waive this requirement if We \nreceive written proof acceptable to Us that  further care would be of no benefit \nto You; and \n \nc. You are not Totally Disabled.  \n \n. . . .  \nResidual Disability must follow right af ter a period of Total Disability that \nlasts at least as long as th e Qualification Period, if any. \n [ER 283, 310].  \nb. Plaintiff’s Initial Claim \n On or about December 15, 1993, Plaintiff commenced his employment with Osprey \nInformatics as its Chief Executive Officer. [ER 5, 14]. In November 2017, Plaintiff suffered a \npulmonary embolism, which his cardiologist, Sa ndeep G. Aggarwal, MD, FRCP, indicated was \nlikely due to travel. [ER 399–401]. In addition, Plaintiff was diagnose d with the following \nconditions: (1) bicuspid aortic valv e; (2) severe aortic valve stenos is, (3) bicuspid aortopathy; (4) \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 3 of 36     PageID\n#: <pageID> \n4 pulmonary embolus, and (5) chronic renal insuff iciency. [ER 2205]. Due to his increasing heart \nproblems, Plaintiff decreased hi s work hours beginning April 1, 2019, and reported his last day of \nwork as April 30, 2019. [ER 10, 399–401]. On May 14, 2019, Plaintiff submitted his LTD claim, \nclaiming that he had a disability and listed his medical conditions as “severe valvular stenosis, \nmild left ventricular hypertrophy, and dilated ascending aorta.” [ER 52–59]. Plaintiff included his \nsymptoms as shortness of breath, lack of energy, confusion, dizzi ness, and anxiety. [ Id.]. In the \nbenefits application, Plai ntiff stated that he could not perfo rm the following occupational duties: \n“travel, long hours, presenta tions, complex decision-making, stress.” [ER 54]. Plaintiff \nsubsequently underwent open heart surgery on June  19, 2019, for an aortic valve replacement and \nan ascending aorta replaceme nt. [ER 1394]. After the surger y, Plaintiff’s recovery was \ncomplicated due to a wound infe ction requiring hospitalization from July 23, 2019, to July 26, \n2019, and a syncopal event with loss of consci ousness for which he was hospitalized from \nSeptember 5, 2019, to September 10, 2019. [ER 1284].  \n Due to Plaintiff’s limited ability to sustai n a consistent level of activity throughout his \nworkday, Unum granted LTD benefits on Sept ember 27, 2019, and decided to reevaluate \nPlaintiff’s claim beginning Ja nuary 1, 2020, by obtaining updated cardiac rehab records. [ER \n1290–91]. \nc. Defendant’s Termination of Plaintiff’s Claim \n On January 3, 2020, Defendant requested updated  medical info rmation to assist in its \ncontinued evaluation of Plaintif f’s LTD claim. [ER 1325]. In re viewing whether to terminate \nPlaintiff’s LTD benefits, Unum reviewed the following medical and voca tional information:  \n July 1, 2019: In a phone call betw een Plaintiff and the Disabil ity Benefit Specialist (DBS) \nreviewing his claim, Plaintiff provided details  about his disability and job duties. [ER 329–\nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 4 of 36     PageID\n#: <pageID> \n5 32]. Plaintiff reported that hi s duties included “supervising op erations, defusing strategy, \ncommunications with shareholders and board members, and meetings with/presentations \nfor clients and community stake holders.” [ER 331]. Moreover, Plaintiff claimed that travel \nwas a “significant portion of his duties.” [ Id.].  \n August 5, 2019: Unum conducted a forum discussi on and decided that it needed to “find \nout about travel and corroborate [Plaintiff’s] statement regarding his travel requirements.” \n[ER 465]. Unum explained that “the difference between c onsidering [Plaintiff’s] pre-\ndisability occ as a sedentary occ vs. a light oc c is dependent on whet her [Plaintiff] traveled \na lot.” [ Id.]. Based on that determination, Unum  decided that it needed a “better \nunderstanding of his row [sic], duties, and demands in this  role, both pre-disability and \nsince disability started.” [ Id.].  \n August 20, 2019: Senior Vocational Rehab Cons ultant, Arthur Dumont, MA MS. CRC, \nreviewed Plaintiff’s file to determine hi s pre-disability duties as CEO of Osprey \nInformatics. [ER 1124–27]. Mr. Dumont noted  that there was an “absence of \ndocumentation regarding the dut ies and travel demands of his occupation.” [ER 1125]. \nBased on the lack of information, Mr. Dumont  defined the position and duties of CEO as \nthe occupation is performed in the national economy. [ Id.]. These were found to include: \n(i) planning, developing, estab lishing, and overseei ng interpretation and implementation of \npolicies, and objectives of the organization in  accordance with the board of directors and \ncorporate charter; (ii) confer ring with organization leadership  to plan business objectives, \ndevelop organizational policie s, establish responsibilitie s and procedure to attain \nobjectives; (iii) review activity and financia l reports; (iv) directing and coordinating \nfinancial programs to provide  funding for operations to ma ximize return on investments \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 5 of 36     PageID\n#: <pageID> \n6 and increase productivity; (v) planning and de veloping industrial,  labor, and public \nrelations policies; and (v i) evaluating performance of executives. [ER 1125–26]. Mr. \nDumont also found the physical demands of the occupation to be in the sedentary range,2 \nthough he did note that a deter mination of strength demands is  partially dependent on the \ninsured’s travel demands. [ER 1126]. Mr. Dumont explained that  “frequent air travel would \nlikely require strength demands in the light range,3 where infrequent travel would be \nindicative of sedentary demands .” However, Mr. Dumont agai n explained that Plaintiff’s \ntravel could not be determined ba sed on the information provided. [ Id.].  \n August 21, 2019: Plaintiff was treated by Richar d Dear, MD, for his initial visit post-\nsurgery. [ER 1437–39]. Dr. Dear reported that  Plaintiff was “sta ble from a cardiac \nperspective” and “is encouraged  to continue with current exercise program.” [ER 1438]. \nPlaintiff also denied chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, PND, orthopnea, pre syncope or \nsyncope, but reported that he does get dizzy from time to time. [ER 1437].  \n August 30, 2019: In another follow up visit after his surgery, Pl aintiff was evaluated by his \ncardiac surgeon, Paul W.M. Fedak, MD, PhD, FRCSC. [E R 1328–33]. Dr. Fedak explained \nthat Plaintiff “has made a good recovery” and his complications following surgery are now \n“well healed.” [ER 1328]. In addition, Dr. Fedak included a return-to-work date of September 23, 2019, w ith no limitations. [ Id.].   \n September 9, 2019: After obtaining additional in formation from Osprey Informatics, Mr. \nDumont completed a second occupational analysis. [ER 1154–62]. Darrell Nimchuk, the \nInterim CFO of Osprey, provided Unum with in formation relating to Plaintiff’s job duties. \n \n2 An occupation in the “sedentary range” primarily involves “sitting, with brief periods of standing and walking, and \noccasional lifting or applying for ce up to 10 lbs.” [ER 1126].  \n \n3 An occupation in the “light range” includes “occasional lifting or applyi ng force up to 20  lbs.” [ER 1126].  \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 6 of 36     PageID\n#: <pageID> \n7 While Mr. Nimchuk could not re spond to most of the inform ation requested, he did note \nthat Plaintiff worked around 40 hours a w eek. [ER 1154]. In addition, on September 9, \n2019, Mr. Nimchuk sent an em ail to Unum stating,  \nAs i was not here during that time, i can c onclude that Osprey was a western Canada \nbased company with limited ot her clients. He may have ha d to travel to see potential \n/ current investors but again it would have  been minimal. I believe he spent most \nof his time in the office and a long- term employee confirmed that for me. \n \n[ER 1168]. In response to Unum seeking verification of Plaint iff’s travel at  Osprey from \nMr. Nimchuk, Plaintiff sent an ema il to Unum on August 27, 2019, explaining,  \nas Darrell wasn’t at Osprey when I was th ere it may be helpful for him to reference \na similar form that Celeste filled out re. the parallel claim with Wawanesa. As this \nwas completed separately by Celeste and sent  directly to Wawane sa I don’t have a \ncopy. Darrell should be able to acces s this via Osprey’s Dropbox system. \n \n[ER 1166]. With the updated in formation, Mr. Dumont again reported that there was not \nenough information to make a de termination on Plaint iff’s travel require ments and defined \nhis occupation as a CEO under the national standard. [ER 1154–62]. \n September 18, 2019: In a letter to Phnendren  Naidu, MD, MBCHB, Plaintiff’s primary \ncare physician, Dr. Aggarwal wrote that Pl aintiff’s recent echocardiogram “show[ed] a \nnormally functioning prosthetic aortic valve”  and recommended a follow-up appointment \nin one year. [ER 1397–98].  \n September 23, 2019: Unum conducted a forum disc ussion of Plaintiff’ s restrictions and \nlimitations and occupational demands. [ER 1175.]. Based on Mr. Nimchuk’s email, Unum \nvocational consultant Robert Rodecker conclu ded that Plaintiff performed a “sedentary \noccupation.” [ Id.]. The forum also included statemen ts from Unum’s internal clinical \nconsultant, Maureen Laprade, RN . Nurse Laprade reviewed Plaint iff’s file and concluded:  \nAs previously noted in the 8/5/19 forum “While a pers on can travel by air with \naortic stenosis they are at higher risk fo r a sudden cardiac arre st and it would be \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 7 of 36     PageID\n#: <pageID> \n8 prudent not to fly to allow for access to  immediate cardiac emergency services.” \nAir travel would be the only travel rest riction and would be supported through the \nrecovery period to 9/23/19 as would other R&L’s noted on the 6/20/19 APS. \n \n. . .  \n \nMedically [Plaintiff] does have suppor t from 04/01/2019 with R&L’s of no \nlifting/pushing pulling would likely be s upported. [Plaintiff] would also be \nprecluded from travel. It is reasonable that prior to and after the surgery of \n(04/01/2019 – 09/23/2019) [Plain tiff] may be supported fr om even sedentary work \n…Beyond 09/23/2019 we would need to clarify [Plaintiff’s] travel  duties before we \ncould understand if he would continue to be disabled. \n \n[ER 465, 1175–76]. Because Plaintiff planned to st art his 12 weeks of cardiac rehabilitation \non September 19, 2019, Nurse Laprade noted that “R  & L’s for limited ab ility to sustain a \nconsistent level of activity throughout the workday would be supported until completion \nof cardiac rehab.” ER 1286–1287. \n October 31, 2019: Plaintiff wa s treated by Shelley Krake,  MD. [ER 1394–95]. Dr. Krake \nindicated that Plaintiff was “stable from a ca rdiac perspective” and could “continue with \n[his] current exercise program . . . and the a ddition of light weight [resistance training].” \n[ER 1395]. Dr. Krake also noted that Plaint iff continued to have occasional light \nheadedness (often on rising fro m sitting or lying) and was under-hydrated. [ER 1394].  \n December 9, 2019: Plaintiff was treated by Alexandra Bell, MD. [ER 1390–92]. Dr. Bell \nreported that Plaintiff was “sta ble from a cardiac perspective” and “encouraged to continue \nwith their current exercise program. [ER 1391]. In addition, Dr. Bell reported that \nPlaintiff’s “orthostatic dizzi ness has improved.” [ER 1390].  \n December 10, 2019: As part of Pl aintiff’s cardiac rehabilitation  program, he was again seen \nby Dr. Aggarwal. [ER 1831–33]. Dr. Aggarwal reported that Pl aintiff “is doing well 18 \nmonths post-mechanical AVR,” has no cardiac or endocarditis symptoms, and is “stable \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 8 of 36     PageID\n#: <pageID> \n9 from a cardiac perspective.” [ER 1831]. Plaintif f reported still feeling “tired and not quite \nback to his best level of fitne ss but things are getting better.” [ Id.].  \n January 13, 2021: Plaintiff had a teleconsultati on with Dr. Aggarwal, who reported that \nPlaintiff “is clinically  stable without any evidence of  issues.” [ER 1829–30]. Dr. Aggarwal \nalso noted that he sent blood work to be te sted because he could not explain Plaintiff’s \n“poor exercise tolerance.” [ER 1829]. On  March 10, 2021, Plaintiff’s DBS called Dr. \nNaidu’s office to follow up on the blood wor k. [ER 1883]. An individual named Lyka \nanswered the phone and told th e DBS that, after reviewing th e results, she did not believe \nthat the blood work show ed anything significant. [ Id.]. In addition, she reported that \nPlaintiff did not have any further appo intments with Dr. Naidu scheduled. [ Id.]. \n February 1, 2021: Dr. Aggarwal, in an Attend ing Physician Statemen t, noted Plaintiff’s \nsymptoms as “severe generalized fatigue and decreased exercise tolerance,” but no formal \nfunctional assessment was completed. [ER 1815–16]. Dr. Aggarw al’s only listed \nrestriction and limita tion was no heavy lifting above 50 pounds. [ Id.].  \n February 19, 2021: Nurse Laprade again reviewed  Plaintiff’s claim an d concluded that the \n“basis for ongoing R&L’s is not well explai ned by the available information.” [ER 1867]. \nShe suggested that an in-house physician reviewer look at Pl aintiff’s R&Ls. [ Id.]. \n March 3, 2021: Unum’s on-site  physician (OSP), Frederick Sc hwartz, MD, contacted Dr. \nAggarwal to discuss Plaintif f’s R&Ls. [ER 1872–73]. Both Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Aggarwal \nagreed, from a cardiac perspective, “there is no reason he can not return to his work on a \nfull-time basis.” [ER 1873]. Both doctors’ opinion s were in relation to Plaintiff working a \njob in the sedentary rang e for 40 hours a week. [ Id.].  \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 9 of 36     PageID\n#: <pageID> \n10  After reviewing all the fore going information, Unum decided to terminate Plaintiff’s LTD \nbenefits on March 12, 2021. [ER 1940–44]. In its letter of denial sent to Plaintiff, Unum defined \nPlaintiff’s occupation as a CEO pe rformed in the national standard and explaine d that the “physical \ndemands of this occupation are in  the sedentary range.” [ER 1941]. Unum also found that travel \nwas a “minimal part” of Plaint iff’s occupation, which is indica tive of a sedentary occupation. [ Id.]. \nImportantly, Unum cited three pieces of evidence in support of its determination: (1) Dr. Aggarwal’s Attending Physician St atement, which only listed one  R&L of no heavy lifting above \n50 pounds; (2) the telephone call between Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Aggarwal on March 3, 2021, \nwhere both doctors agreed that there was no reason Plaintiff could not retu rn to work on a full-\ntime basis; and (3) Dr. Naidu’s report that th ere were no significant findings from the blood work \ncompleted in January 2021. [ER 1940–44].  \nd. Defendant Reevaluates Plaintiff’s LTD Claim \n On March 10, 2021, Plaintiff su bmitted a re-evaluation re quest, arguing that Unum \nincorrectly understood the specif ic demands of his position as  CEO of Osprey. [ER 1974]. In \nrelevant part, Plaintiff explai ned that “turning-around Osprey required 50+ hour, high stress \nworkweeks actively engaging employees, board-mem bers, clients, investors, regulators and \ntechnology experts as well as  travel into dangerous indus trial settings or demanding \nfinancing/technology forums.” [ Id.]. Plaintiff claimed that Unum’s  classification of his occupation \nwas clearly not the “‘9to5,’ sedentary occupati on that [Unum] imagined  in the preliminary \nclassification.” [ Id.]. On June 30, 2021, Plaintiff sent an em ail to Unum explaining, “I am no longer \ncapable of, and will be at-risk by, consistently  performing the key functional requirements \nof my Occupation either at-all or at  the levels expected.” [ER 2067.].  \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 10 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n11  Again, plaintiff provided a dditional documentation to support his disa bility. In its re-\nevaluation of Plaintiff’s claim,  Unum reviewed the following  additional information:   \n March 15, 2021: Plaintiff provid ed Unum with an Attending Physician Statement from Dr. \nNaidu, stating that she had ad vised Plaintiff “not to retu rn to the highly stressful \nenvironment and long hours of his previous employment.” [ER 1975].   \n April 1, 2021: OSP Dr. Schwartz contacted Dr . Naidu to discuss Plaintiff’s R&Ls. [ER \n1989–90]. Dr. Naidu confirmed that he continued to support Plai ntiff’s inability to return \nto the workplace on a full-time basis due to his recovery from cardiac valve replacement \nsurgery. [ER 1989]. Dr. Naidu explained how Plai ntiff had reported cogn itive decline with \nmemory impairment, chest pain, and dizziness with mental exertion. [ Id.]. Dr. Naidu also \nconfirmed that Plaintiff underwent a CT scan, which was unremarkable. [ Id.]. \n June 1, 2021: Unum received updated medical records from Dr. Naidu, including progress \nnotes, labs/diagnostics, and other nonmedic al information. [ER 2000–09]. Plaintiff \nreported to Dr. Naidu feelings of frustration and confusion wh ich led him to avoid social \ninteractions. [ER 2001]. He also  reported difficulty performin g familiar tasks from time to \ntime and noticeable changes to his behavior personality. [ Id.]. Plaintiff also reported a \n30/30 score on the Mini-Mental State Examin ation and a 25/30 score on the Montreal \nCognitive Assessment. [ER 2002–08].  \n June 21, 2021: Dr. Naidu completed another At tending Physician Stat ement and identified \ncoronary artery disease and valvular heart di sease as disabilities that impact Plaintiff’s \nfunctional capacity. [ER 2071–73]. Dr. Naidu did not  list any physical restrictions, physical \nlimitations, or behavioral heal th restrictions. [ER 2073].  \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 11 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n12  July 15, 2021: Dr. Schwartz again reviewed Plai ntiff’s LTD claim file and spoke to doctors \nAggarwal and Naidu. [ER 2093–95].  Dr. Schwartz examined each  of the following possible \nmedical disabilities: aortic stenosis, coronary artery di sease, pulmonary embolism, \ncognitive impairment, a nd bilateral knee pain. [ Id.].  After reviewing all the medical \nevidence available, Dr. Schw artz found “no medical condition, alone or in combination, \nthat would preclude the insured from perform ing the required tasks of his occupation as \noutlined by the [Vocational Rehabi litation Consultant].” [ER 2093].  \n July 19, 2021: Dr. Schwartz referred Plaintiff’s claim to  Designated Medical Officer, \nJoseph T. Palermo, DO, MBA, FACOI. [ER 2098–2100]. Dr. Palermo revi ewed Plaintiff’s \nLTD claim file and concluded that he “agree[ s] with the report of  [Dr. Schwartz] the \nclaimant was not precluded from meeting the listed occupational demands.” [ER 2100]. In \nreaching his conclusi on, Dr. Palermo noted: \nDr. Naidu appears to be the only phys ician opining ongoing restrictions. Dr. \nNaidu does not document an assessment  of any cognitive  impairment. No \nneurologic exam is documented, and the initial testing does not conform \ncognitive impairment. No cons ultation with Neurology or \nneuropsychological testing is done to  confirm cognitive impairment. [Dr. \nNaidu] appear to mention the claimant’s description of the symptoms and impairments. The record does not incl ude a detailed discussion of the \nclaimant’s symptoms and complaints. The examination does not document physical abnormalities, and there is no evidence of objective physical \nimpairments. [Dr. Naidu] has not disc ussed the demands of the claimant’s \noccupation. No functional assessment was performed.  \n  \n[ER 2099]. Dr. Palermo opines th at Dr. Naidu’s assessment  is “not supported” and \nconcludes that the asserted work restrictions are “inconsistent with the insured’s reported \nsymptoms, physical exam findings, diagnostic te sting, reported activities, and intensity of \nmanagement reflected in the file.”  \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 12 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n13  July 27, 2021: Mr. Dumont, Unum’s vocational rehabilitation consulta nt, again reviewed \nPlaintiff’s file and performed a third voca tional assessment. [ER 2103–06]. Since the prior \nvocational assessment, Plaintiff submitted the following additional evidence documenting \nhis occupational duties: (1) an April 27, 2020 email sent to Unum in which Plaintiff \nreported that he signed a thr ee-month consulting contract  beginning in May 2020; (2) a \nnarrative statement by Plaintif f describing his duties as “working 50+ hour work weeks, \ninvolving actively engaging empl oyees, board-members, clients, investors, regulators, and \ntechnology experts; and travel into ‘da ngerous industrial settings or demanding \nfinancial/technology forums;’” (3) a June 30, 2021 email sent to Unum in which Plaintiff \ndescribed his job as requiring “‘top-decile  mental acuity,’ long hours, high stress, and \n‘material amount of travel;’” (4) a document listing the Boar d of Directors from another \ncompany which identified Plaintiff as the CE O of Osprey and listed his experience as \n“serving as an executive with Canadian and a US multinational Bank; and CEO of two Alberta-based technology companies.” [ER 2104].   After reviewing Plai ntiff’s file and the \nadditional documentation, Mr. Dumont conclu ded that there was not enough evidence to \nconfirm his duties and continued to define it as performed in the national economy. [ Id.]. \nHe also determined that the strength demands of Plaintiff’s occupation would be in the \n“sedentary range” and, continuing to rely on the response from Osprey on September 9, \n2019, significant travel was not  a part of his duties. [ER 2105]. Mr. Dumont added, \nhowever, that “the work of a CEO, as noted by the insured in his 3/18/21 statement would \nrequire work hours in excess of 40 hours/week on a regular basis.” [ Id.]. \n \n After reviewing all the a dditional documentation, Unum upheld its decision to deny \nPlaintiff’s LTD benefits claim on September 29, 2021. [ER 2124–27]. Unum informed Plaintiff, \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 13 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n14 that while it is reasonable for a CEO to work in  excess of 40 hours/week , his job demands were \nstill consistent with the “seden tary range.” [ER 1215]. Unum also noted that Plaintiff’s employer \n“described travel to be minimal.”  [ Id.]. Based on this vocational de termination and the existing \nmedical evidence, Unum concluded that Plaintiff had no disabilities that would prevent him from \nperforming all of the important dut ies of his occupation. [ER 2126].  \ne. Plaintiff’s First Appeal  of Unum’s Decision \n On May 12, 2022, Plaintiff, through counsel, of ficially appealed the denial of his LTD \nbenefits. [ER 2203–07]. Unlike in Plai ntiff’s initial claim for benefits, which listed only “severe \nvalvular stenosis, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and dilated ascending aorta” [ER 52–59], \nPlaintiff claimed in his appeal le tter that he stopped working as President and CEO of Osprey in \nApril 2019 due to “the functional effe cts of valvular heart disease, bilateral knee osteoarthritis, and \ncervical degenerative disc disease. ” [ER 2204]. Along with the evidence  already in Plaintiff’s file, \nhis appeal highlights (1) a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) by Ryan Montemurro, BMR OT: \nCEES, (2) a sworn declaration by Os prey Interim COO Paul Ritchie,  (3) an independent vocational \nevaluation report by Dr. Bentley Hankins, and (4) additional medi cal records from Dr. Fedek, Dr. \nAggarwal, Dr. Steve Martin, and Dr. Eldridge Batuyong.  \n1. Functional Capacity Evaluation: On January 17, 2022, Mr. Montemurro performed an FCE on \nPlaintiff. [ER 2212–39]. Mr. Montemurro  concluded, among other things:  \nIn terms of overall working tolerance, based on his perform ance during the FCE, \nMr. Logan would have diffic ulties with prolonged neck flexion, prolonged sitting, \nand prolonged standing. Based upon hi s overall functioning during 5.25 hours of \ntesting as well as his reported symptom impa ct, he would be fit to work part-time \nin his pre-heart surgery capacity. However,  a job as a CEO is not part-time work. \nIn the opinion of this Evaluator, Mr. L ogan would not be sustainable were he to \nreturn to working his pre- heart surgery hours and physical  demands as a CEO. In \naddition to the physical and functional diffic ulties, there are also difficulties that \nappear to be related to the residual symptoms post-heart surgery. These would revolve around symptoms of fa tigue experienced with work ing at least twelve hours \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 14 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n15 per day, plus additional time on weekends , and with fatigue experiences with \nworking those hours that are generally higher stress. Additionally, Mr. Logan was noted to experience mild shortness of br eath with speaking for extended periods of \ntime during the FCE as we ll as during activity.  \n There are difficulties in provi ding an opinion of Mr. Logan’ s fitness to work at the \nsame capacity that he did prior to going off work prior to heart surgery. Firstly, there were no medical prognoses in the medical documentation reviewed by this \nEvaluator, from either a cardi ac or orthopaedic (knee) pers pective. With regard to \nMr. Logan’s knees, prognoses will not li kely be provided until after the knee \nreplacement surgeries have been comp leted, recovery fro m surgery, and post-\nsurgical rehabilitation is completed. Sec ondly, Mr. Logan is set to have right knee \nreplacement surgery in the next few mont hs (date not yet determined). Following a \nsuccessful knee replacement and time for reco very and post-surgical rehabilitation, \nit would be expected that his functional abilities woul d improve to an extent. \nHowever, his left knee may also need to be replaced given the reported “moderate \nto severe” level of osteoarthritis in th at knee. Again, following successful knee \nreplacement surgery and recovery/rehab ilitation afterword, Mr . Logan’s overall \nlevel of function should improve. The timeline for a possible left knee replacement is unknown to this Evaluator.   With regard to Mr. Logan’s residual sy mptoms of fatigue, decreased exercise \nendurance/tolerance, and shor tness of breath, Dr. Aggarw al, in January 2021, stated \nhe “is clinically stable w ithout any evidence of issues” related to his heart, but \ncannot “explain his poor exercise tolera nce.” Dr. Aggarwal recommended blood \nwork to see if that may explain that issue. There was no documentation regarding \nthis blood work or follow- up with his cardiologist.  \n [ER 2226]. The FCE also revealed that  Plaintiff has the ability to oc casionally lift and carry up to \n10 to 15 pounds, which falls within the category of sedentary to light exer tional activity. [ER 2212–\n39]. 2. Paul Ritchie’s Sworn Declaration: On Februa ry 2, 2022, James Paul Ritchie, then serving as \nOsprey’s Chief Operating Officer, submitted a sw orn declaration detailing Plaintiff’s job duties. \n[ER 2566]. Mr. Ritchie worked with Plaintiff while he was CEO at Osprey and, subsequently, took \nover some of Plaintiff’s respons ibilities after he departed. [ Id.]. Based on his familiarity with the \nrole of CEO at Osprey, Mr. Ritchi e testified that, on average, “the role of CEO at Osperity can be \nexpected to work 60 hours per week, sometimes more on a busier week.” [ Id.]. He also testified \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 15 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n16 that the role requires “extensive travel totaling a pproximately 1/3 of the workdays during a typical \nyear” and regularly requires “trave l to industrial sites such as util ities, oil/gas, and hydroelectric \nsites” that are often not located near ai rports, requiring driving long distances. [ Id.]. \n3. Independent Vocational Evaluation: On Marc h 25, 2022, Dr. Hankins, a ce rtified rehabilitation \ncounselor and vocational evaluati on specialist, complete d a vocational evaluation report regarding \nPlaintiff’s occupational duties. [ER 2621–36]. Afte r reviewing Plaintiff’s medical and work \ndocumentation, along with the FCE report and Mr . Ritchie’s sworn declaration, Dr. Hankins \nopined:  \nIn conclusion, available ev idence strongly suggests that  Mr. Logan meets his long-\nterm disability insurance policy’s defi nition of residual disability. Though Mr. \nLogan retains the capacity to engage in sedentary to light exertional activity, he is only able to do so on a part-t ime basis. He is accordingly unable to consistently \nengage in full-time work activity, particular ly in the highly st ressful position of a \npresident and chief executiv e officer that, though typical ly sedentary in terms of \nphysical demands, requires extensive travel and 60-hour work weeks. While Mr. \nLogan does continue to engage in part-t ime employment as a consultant/advisor, \nhis injury or sickness (a combination of his valvular heart disease, bilateral knee \nosteoarthritis and cervical degenerative disc disease) and resulting diminished \nfunctional capacity render him unable to perform the important duties of his \nprevious occupation as president and chief executive officer of Osprey Informatics \nfor more then 80% of the time normally required to perform such duties (i.e. which would require upwards of 50 hours of work activity per week).  \n \n[ER 2632]. In reaching his conclusion regarding Pl aintiff’s occupational duties, Dr. Hankins relied \non Plaintiff’s own statements and Mr. Ritchie’s sworn declaration. [ Id.]. Moreover, Dr. Hankins \nexplained that “this significant workload (asi de from the inherent st ress of a chief executive \nposition) is consistent with a study published in  the Harvard Business Review (Porter & Norhia, \n2018) which found that chief executive officers sp end an average of 62.5 hours per week engaged \nin work activity.” [ Id.].  \n4. Additional Medical Records: Al ong with many of the same documents that Unum had already \nreceived, Plaintiff also submitte d the following medical records:  \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 16 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n17  January 27, 2020: Plaintiff provided medical record s regarding a right hernia repair surgery \nperformed by Dr. Steven A. Martin. [E R 2310–19]. The last record provided is a \nhandwritten note by Dr. Martin to Dr. Naidu wh ich reports that Plaintiff “feels well” and \nhas “no concerns.” [ER 2310].  \n July 27, 2021: In a letter sent to Dr. Aggarw al, Dr. Fedak stated th at Plaintiff’s recent \nechocardiogram shows “a very low gradient and no concern with his value.” [ER 2302]. \nDr. Fedak reports that Plaintiff is “clinically well” and “will make an  effort to follow up \nwith him in 2-3 years’ time with a repeat echocardiogram and MRI to look at any residual \naortopathy.” [ Id.].  \n September 23, 2021: Orthopedic su rgeon Dr. Eldridge Batuyong wrote a letter to Dr. Naidu \nexplaining his recommended treatment for Plaintiff’s knees. [E R 2321–24]. Dr. Batuyong \nreported that Plaintiff has “bil ateral knee significant end-stag e osteoarthritis, right more \nsymptomatic than left, in the setting of pr evious right ACL recons truction and retained \nhardware.” [ER 2321]. Dr. Batuyong confirmed that he had received informed consent \nfrom Plaintiff to proceed with total knee replacement of both knees. [ER 2322].  \n December 22, 2021: In a letter to Dr. Naidu, Dr. Aggarwal reported that Plaintiff “is stable \nand needs knee surgery in Ontario” and “is stable for non-cardiac surgery.” [ER 2365–70]. \nDr. Aggarwal also noted that  Plaintiff has “limited func tional capacity based on his \ncombined diseases (pulmonary embolism, aortic stenosis, knee joint issues requiring surgery). [ER 2365].  \n With all the foregoing inform ation, Senior Vocational Rehabilitation Consultant, Shannon \nO’Kelley, M. Ed., CRC, CEAS, reviewed Plai ntiff’s LTD claim on June 1, 2022. [ER 2670–73]. \nMs. O’Kelley concluded that Dr. Hankins’ report,  while providing “additiona l demands to include \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 17 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n32 Case No. 1:18-cv-248, 2022 WL 966848, *15 (E.D. Tenn. March 30, 2022) (citing Kalish v. \nLiberty Mut./Liberty Life Assur. Co. of Bos. , 419 F.3d 501, 510 (6th Cir.  2005)). And there is no \n“heightened burden of explanation on administrat ors when they reject a treating physician’s \nopinion,” Kalish , 419 F.3d at 508 (quoting Black & Decker Disability Plan , 538 U.S. 822, 831 \n(2003)). At the same time, “when a plan administr ator’s explanation is based on the work of a \ndoctor in its employ, we must view th e explanation with some skepticism.” Moon v. Unum \nProvident Corp. , 405 F.3d 373, 381-82 (6th Cir. 2005). \n Here, as the Court has explaine d, while Unum’s physicians clea rly disagree with Dr. Naidu, \nthey did so on the assumption that  Plaintiff’s occupation fell into the sedentary range. Unum has \nnot provided a single physician that  reviewed Plaintiff’s disabiliti es in the context of a 60-hour \nwork week with frequent travel. Therefore, altho ugh one medical opinion is not ordinarily entitled \nto greater weight than another, the Court finds Dr. Naidu’s opinion particularly persuasive because \nit evaluates Plaintiff’s disability in th e context of his actu al job duties.   \n Unum argues that Dr. Naidu’s opinion is unreliable because it is unsupported by objective \nmedical findings. [Doc. 29 at 22–23]. However, the record demonstrates that Dr. Naidu’s \nconclusions are grounded in her l ongstanding treatment of Plaintif f and her continuous evaluations \nof his condition throughout surgery and the post-surgical recovery period. [ See ER 2807–08]. To \ncombat this, Unum cites three case s in its support, each are disti nguishable from this  case. First, \nin Creech v. UNUM Life Ins. Co. , 162 Fed. Appx. 445, 453 (6th Cir. 2006 ), the court found that it \nwas not arbitrary and capr icious for the plan ad ministrator to discount the attending physician’s \nopinion, noting that it lacked supporting data, was inc onsistent over time, and conflicted with other \nclinic reports. The plan administrator in that case also had other reliable medical opinions available \nto support its decision.  Id. at 457. By contrast, Dr. Naidu’s opinion has remained consistent \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 32 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n33 throughout this case and is grounded in  his annual physical examinati ons and review of Plaintiff’s \nmedical records. No comparable medical opinions exist here to discredit Dr. Naidu’s opinion other \nthan those given in the context of  Plaintiff working less than 60 hour s a week with minimal travel.  \n The same rationale can be used to distinguish Maleszewski v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. , \nNo. 2309-13926, 2010 WL 1416995 at *10 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 8, 2010). In that case, the court found \nthe attending physician’s opinion entirely unreliable b ecause of his bare assertion that the plaintiff \nwas “totally and permanently disabled.” The cour t took issue with the fact that the opinion was \ngiven without any detail. Id. at * 30. Similarly, in Crider v. Highmark Life Ins. Co. , 458 F. Supp. \n2d 487, 506 (W.D. Mich. 2006), the c ourt rejected the attending phys ician’s opinion because it \n“did not state a clear opinion of disability, but rather expressed frustratio n at the decision of the \ninsurance company and puzzlement at the source of plaintiff’s back pain, which the doctor clearly \nexpected should have been re solved by that time.” Unlike the attending physicians in Maleszewski \nand Crider , Dr. Naidu explained the evidence she used to come to her conclusions and clearly \nstated Plaintiff was disabled.  \n Beyond Dr. Naidu’s consistent opinions throu ghout the record, Plaintiff also produces \nobjective evidence of his inability to perfo rm his duties in the form of an FCE. See Huffaker v. \nMetro. Life Ins. Co. , 271 F. App'x 493, 499–500 (6th Cir. 2008) (“One method of objective proof \nof disability, for instance, is a functional capacity ev aluation, a ‘reliable a nd objective method of \ngauging’ the extent one can complete work-related tasks.”); Barnes v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am. , \nNo. 1:19-CV-138, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 256497, 2020 WL 10221073, at *3 (E.D. Tenn. Nov. \n24, 2020) (“And [the plaintiff] al so provided objective proof of his disability by providing the \nFCE.”).  \n After performing the FCE, Mr. Montemurro concluded,  \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 33 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n34 In the opinion of this Evaluator, Mr. L ogan would not be sustainable were he to \nreturn to working his pre- heart surgery hours and physical  demands as a CEO. In \naddition to the physical and functional diffic ulties, there are also difficulties that \nappear to be related to the residual symptoms post-heart surgery. These would revolve around symptoms of fa tigue experienced with work ing at least twelve hours \nper day, plus additional time on weekends , and with fatigue experiences with \nworking those hours that are generally higher stress. Additionally, Mr. Logan was noted to experience mild shortness of br eath with speaking for extended periods of \ntime during the FCE as we ll as during activity.  \n \n[ER 2212–39]. The FCE highlights Plaintiff’s residual symptoms related speci fically to his heart \nsurgery. These findings, relating to his post-heart su rgery issues, are consistent with Dr. Naidu’s \nconclusion that “given [the] severi ty of his medical issues and si de effects of his lifelong [post-\nheart surgery] medication he canno t function in his prev ious occupation due to  the extreme mental \nand physical stressors requi red for a CEO.” [ER 2808].  \n Furthermore, the absence of specific restri ctions and limitations from Dr. Naidu and Mr. \nMontemurro does not demonstrate th at Plaintiff is not disabled. See Wilkinson v. Unum Life Ins. \nCo. of Am. , No. 1:24-cv-205, 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS  122592, at *25–26 (E.D. Tenn. June 27, \n2025) (“Second, the fact that Plaintiff's cardiologi st and rheumatologist did not provide opinions \nas to her restrictions and limitations is not evidence that she is not disabled. There is no evidence \nin the record as to why these doc tors did not give opinions. The l ack of response c ould be due to \nvarious reasons, including the fact physicians  have busy schedules  with many different \nresponsibilities and obligations.”). Like Wilkinson , nothing in the record shows why Dr. Naidu did \nnot provide specific restrictions and limitations. The very fact th at Dr. Naidu and Mr. Montemurro \nconcluded Plaintiff could not return to work sugge sts they likely deemed specific restrictions and \nlimitations unnecessar y. In any event, Dr. Naidu’s opinion, c oupled with the objec tive findings in \nthe FCE, demonstrate that Plaintiff has a disability relating to his heart that restricted his ability to \nperform the important job duties of his occupation. \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 34 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n35  While the Court recognizes that Plaintiff ha s not produced the volum e of evidence offered \nby Defendant, the applicable standard requires on ly a preponderance of th e evidence. Considering \nthe FCE report, Dr. Naidu’s medical opinions, and the absence of any contrary medical opinions \nrelating to Plaintiff’s actual job duties, the Court finds that Plaintiff has established by a \npreponderance of the evidence that he is disabled  due to his cardiac condition as defined under the \nPolicy.  \n Second, Plaintiff’s reported  leisure and household activi ties, including skiing, golfing, \npickleball, and similar activities, are not cred ibility-shattering. [Doc. 29 at 21–22]. Plaintiff \ngenerally cites these activities as  either aspirational hobbies or t hose he used to perform prior to \nhis disability. For instance, U num cites medical screening form s listing Plainti ff’s hobbies as \nevidence that he is not disabled. [ See ER 2001–02, 2395]. Merely lis ting hobbies on a medical \nintake form does not demonstrate a lack of a di sability. People may list hobbies they previously \nenjoyed or want to enjoy sometime in the futu re on medical intake forms. Additionally, Unum \ncites the FCE report as additional evidence of Plaintiff’s reported leisure activities; however, the \nFCE clearly states, “Mr. Logan reported he has had to reduce his participation in previously \nenjoyed leisure activities due to both his residual symptoms following heart surgery as well as with \nhis knee symptoms. These activities include downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, playing tennis, hiking, taking his dog for daily walks, and play ing pickleball.” [ER 2579- 80]. Finally, Plaintiff \nsubmitted a sworn declaration stating that the leis ure activities listed in the FCE were “intended to \nbe recorded as aspirational activities to be fully resumed once I’m recovered.” [ER 2747].  \n In any event, Plaintiff’s hobbies and househol d activities, whether they  are aspirational or \nnot, are not enough to disp rove his disability.  \nCase 1:24-cv-00113-CEA-CHS     Document 32     Filed 09/24/25     Page 35 of 36 \nPageID #: <pageID> \n36  As to Unum’s third argument relating to Pl aintiff’s other purported disabilities, the Court \nhas already found that Plaintiff is  disabled under the Policy due to his cardiac condition alone. A \nreview of Plaintiff’s other disabi lities is therefore unnecessary.  \n In weighing the evidence relevant to Plaint iff’s actual important job duties, as the Court \nhas defined them, the record demo nstrates that Plaintiff has carri ed his burden of proof. Plaintiff \nhas shown, by a preponderance of th e evidence, that he meets the de finition of having a “residual \ndisability” as define d under the Policy.  \n    V.       CONCLUSION  Upon a de novo  review of the record, the Court finds  Plaintiff has properly shown he was \ndisabled under the Policy and Unum incorrectly terminated his long-term  disability benefits. \nTherefore, the Court will GRANT  Plaintiff’s Motion fo r Judgment on the Plea dings [Doc. 25] and \nENTER  judgment in his favor. It will be ORDERED that Plaintiff's long-ter m disability benefits \nbe reinstated retroactive to March 12, 2021, th rough the date of the Judgment Order.   \n AN APPROPRIATE JUDGMENT  ORDER WILL ENTER. \n SO ORDERED. \n \n/s/ Charles E.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiff Joshua Haltom filed a lawsuit against several defendants, including the City of Henderson Police Department and a judge, alleging constitutional violations, including infringement of religious liberties, following traffic citations and the seizure of a self-printed license plate. The court recommended dismissing the case as the allegations did not establish plausible claims under the law. While there was a mention of screenshots of conversations with AI programs, these were irrelevant to the legal issues at hand.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the actions of the City of Henderson Police Department and other defendants constituted violations of the First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, ADA, and other statutory laws based on the alleged unlawful seizure of a self-printed license plate and subsequent legal proceedings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The magistrate judge recommended dismissing all of the Plaintiff's claims against the defendants, citing a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The court found that the Plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to establish violations of constitutional rights and that law enforcement officers were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you got a ticket for using a fake license plate on your car and then tried to sue the police saying they violated your rights. The court said, \"Sorry, but the law is clear—you need a real, state-issued plate to drive, and your complaints don't show the police did anything wrong.\" The judge said your case should be dismissed because the police weren't breaking any rules by doing their job.",

The Plaintiff apparently presented the officers with a “clergy ID” that \nwas not issued by the State of Tennessee and appears to be issued by the “Haltom Family \nMinistries and Consultants.”  (D.E. 1 -1 at 1 –2.)  Plaintiff received traffic citations for this incident.  \n(Id. at 2.)  During  the traffic stop, Plaintiff alleges that law enforcement officers “escalated tensions \nthrough excessive force, resulting in physical injury to my mother and her wrongful arrest.”  (D.E. \n33 at 2, PageID 218; see D.E. 17 at 1, PageID 73.)  \nOn May 6, 2024, Plaintiff’s wife , Lady Lyn Haltom (“Mrs. Haltom”) , was stopped in a \nvehicle bearing a self -printed license plate, reading “ 1611 - KJV - NOT FOR COMMERCIAL \nUSE - Clergy ” (herein “the License Plate”).   (D.E. 12 at 1, PageID 58 ; see D.E. 21 at 4, PageID \n87 (picture of license plate provided by Plaintiff )).  Plaintiff alleges that Officer Norwalk of the \nHenderson Police Department then seized the License Plate  without due process or consent.  ( Id.)       \nAccording to a statement submitted by Plaintiff , but authored by M rs. Haltom, both the \nPlaintiff and M rs. Haltom attended traffic court on June 19, 2024 , to dispute their traffic citations .  \n(D.E. 9 -2 at 1.)  The undersigned is unclear on exactly what occurred during traffic court but \nproposes the following reasonable inferences made from M rs. Haltom’s observations.  Judge \nSherrod, a named Defendant in this case, opened court by explaining the straightforward nature of \nthe forthcoming proceedings.  ( Id. at 1–2; D.E. 24 -1 at 1, PageID 95.)  When Plaintiff appeared Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 2 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>3 \n before Judge Sherrod to dispute the citations, he also requested that the License Plate  be returned, \nas it “is personal property and a symbol of [] religious identity ” and “personal conviction.”  (D.E. \n9-2 at 2.)   Judge Sherrod allegedly asked court personnel where the License Plate was and received \nan inconclusive response.  ( Id. at 2.)  Plaintiff and a uniformed police officer then had a  brief verbal \nexchange.  ( Id.)  Plaintiff reportedly stated that he needed the License Plate and would place  it \nback on his vehicle.  ( Id.)  The police officer allegedly said something akin to “if you put that back, \nwe will pull you over.”  ( Id.)  At some point, the Plaintiff apparently approached the bench to \nreturn a “pink paper” and to retrieve the License Plate.  (Id. at 2–3.)  Judge Sherrod then issued a \n$125 penalty for the traffic ticket, plus two $50 contempt penalties.  ( Id.) \nB.  Procedural Background  \n 1.  Complaint and Initial Filings  \n Plaintiff filed his complaint on October 2, 2024.  (D.E. 1.)  He alleges that “[a]gents for \n[the Henderson Police Department] were given my lawful Clergy ID when they requested ID but \nall refused numerous times, given notice in court to which unfair trial were ignored.”  ( Id. at 2.)  \nThe Defendants allegedly seized his “property unlawfully, demanding fees for allegations that are \ncontrived, commercial profit pursuits,” which he did not consent to.  ( Id.)  Defendants “also caused \nmy licenses to be suspended  on account of bogus scheme of lies.”  ( Id.)  Plaintiff appears to assert \nhis claim as a deprivation of “religious freedom” and a violation of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct (“ADA”).  ( Id. at 3.)  As to relief, Plaintiff demands acknowledgment of “lawful ID and \nevidence of law” and compensation for “my family’s account for pain and suffering and [] \ndeprivation of rights” in the amount of “2 million USD or troy silver.”  ( Id. at 3.)    \n According to a return of service filed with the Court on October 23, 2024, service was \neffected on the Henderson Police Department  on October 7, 2024. (D.E. 6 , 7.)  The Henderson Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 3 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>4 \n Police Department did not file a timely answer, so this court issued an order, directing the Plaintiff \nto show cause why claims against the Henderson Police Department should not be dismissed for \nfailure to prosecute according to Rule 55 of the Federal Rul es of Civil Procedure.  (D.E. 8.)  On \nNovember 25, 2024, Plaintiff submitted a notice of filing, providing seven (7) documents of \npurported  evidence supporting his claim.  (D.E. 9.)  Finding that this notice was insufficient under \nRules 41(b) and 55 of the  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court issued a second order \nrequiring Plaintiff to show cause why his claims against  the Defendant s should not be dismissed \nfor failure to prosecute.  (D.E. 10.)   Plaintiff then filed eight (8) documents, none of which were a \nmotion for entry of default.  (D.E. 11 , 12, 15 –21.)  During this flurry  of filings, counsel entered a \nnotice of appearance on behalf of all Defendants .  (D.E. 13 , 14.)  Finding that Plaintiff \n“demonstrate[d] his intent to move forward with this c ase, despite confusion,”1 the undersigned \nordered the Henderson Police Department to show cause why default should not be entered against \nthem .  (D.E. 22.)  All Defendants then immediately filed a response to the show cause order and a \nmotion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).  (D.E. 23, 24.)  \n 2.  Motion to Dismiss   \n Defendants ’ motion to dismiss attempts to address all claims raised in Plaintiff’s Complaint \nand his other  miscellaneous filings.  For clarity, the Court will summarize all the Defendants’ \nrebuttals.  First, the Defendants encourage this Court to interpret the First Amendment as a bar to \nconsidering “church doctrine or ecclesiastical law” in this matter.  (D.E . 24-1 at 3, PageID 97  \n(citing Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese  for U.S & Can.  v. Milivojevich , 426 U.S. 696, 724 –25 \n(1978))).  Next, Plaintiff failed to establish the essential element s of a barratry claim because he \n \n1  Of note, the undersigned ordered Plaintiff “to familiarize himself with the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure , as “ failure to comply with this Court’s orders and/or the Federal Rules of Civil  \nProcedure may result in sanctions, including dismissal. ”  (D.E. 22 at 2.)  Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 4 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>5 \n did not allege facts that Defendants “stir[red] up baseless litigation.”  ( Id. at 3–4, PageID 97 –98.)  \nPlaintiff also cannot bring a claim against the “City of Henderson, Tennessee Police Department” \nbecause police departments “are not legal entities capable of being sued.”  ( Id. at 4, PageID 98  \n(citing Taylor v. City of Jackson , No. 12 -1221, 2013 WL 5781680 (W.D. Tenn. Oct. 24, 2013) \n(citation cleaned up))).  To the extent this Court construes the claims against the Henderson Police \nDepartment as claims against the City of Henderson, Defendants argue that “[m]unicipalities are \nnot liable under § 1983 merely because they employ tortfeasors[,]” and Plaintiff “has  not alleged \nany facts from which this Court could reasonably infer that the City of Henderson, Tennessee, had \na policy, custom, or procedure that caused a violation  of [his] civil rights.”  ( Id. at 4–5, PageID \n98–99 (citation omitted)).   Furthermore, the Plaintiff has not alleged any purported violation of a \nsales or commercial transaction, so he cannot bring any claims under the Uniform Commercial \nCode.  ( Id. at 9, PageID 103.)  \nConcerning the License Plate, Defendants note that Plaintiff’s willful violation of \nTennessee’s car registration and license plate laws means that “he has no cause of action for his \nfailure to display a properly issued license plate.”  ( Id. at 5, PageID 99 (Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 55 -\n4-101, 55 -5-114(d))).  Similarly, Plaintiff “does not have a First Amendment right to display an \nunapproved license plate of his own creation” and confiscating the License Plate “did not violate \nthe free exercise clause” because Defendants  did not interfere “with the practice of his religion.”  \n(Id. at 5–6, PageID 99 –100.) \nRegarding immunity, Defendants argue that Judge Sherrod and the individual officers are \nall immune from the claims alleged.  Judge Sherrod claims absolute immunity because “[i]t is well \nestablished that Judges enjoy judicial immunity from suits arising out  of the performance of their \njudicial duties.”  ( Id. at 6, PageID 100  (citing Brookings v. Clunk , 389 F.3d 614, 617 (6th Cir. Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 5 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>6 \n 2004) ).  Defendants note that Plaintiff’s allegations against Judge Sherrod are derived from Mrs. \nHaltom’s statement and not the complaint, and the statement clearly “show [s] that Judge Sherrod \nwas presiding over the court and [Plaintiff]’s dealings with [Judge Sherrod] were part of the \nadjudicatory process.”  ( Id. at 6–7, PageID 100 –01.)  Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot bring \nthe claims against the individual officers under § 1983, as the officers each claim qualified \nimmunity.  ( Id. at 7–9, PageID 101–103.)  Under Sixth Circuit precedence, Defendants claim that \nthe officers should be found immune because Plaintiff has not alleged with specificity that the \nindividual officers violated a clearly established constitutional right.  ( Id. at 9, PageID 103.)  \n3.  Other Motions to Date  \n Since Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss was filed, the parties have exchanged several \nmotions and filings.  (D.E. 25 –47.)  In summary, Plaintiff has filed a n apparent  response to \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss, notices for submission of evidence, motions regarding production \nof evidence by the Defendants, and motions to strike.  ( See generally  D.E. 25, 27 –29, 33 –36, 38 –\n42, 44, 46, 48.)  Other filings include Plaintiff ’s attempt s to provide additional evidence in the \nform of radio broadcasts, Bible verses, letters to the Mayor of Henderson, Vatican  law, and \nscreenshotted conversations with Artificial Intelligence programs .  (See generally D.E. 25, 27 –29, \n33–36, 38 –42, 44, 46 , 48.)  Nearly all motions and filings have, to some degree, been o pposed by \nthe Defendants as premature, frivolous, or otherwise irrelevant to the case at its current pre -\ndiscovery stage.  ( See generally D.E. 26, 30, 32, 37, 43, 45, 47.)  \n Relevant to the analysis below , Plaintiff filed a brief rebuttal to Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss, which outlines legal arguments that he believes support his claims.  (D.E. 27.)  Plaintiff \nalso offered a “Memorandum in Support of Opposition to Motion to Dismiss .”  (D.E. 31.)  This \nfiling is starkly different from Plaintiff’s other filings in that it refers to the Plaintiff in the third Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 6 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>7 \n person, presents Mrs. Haltom’s narrative of traffic court that Plaintiff previously entered, provides \nadditional details regarding Plaintiff’s alleged disability, and presents new legal arguments for the \nfirst time.  ( Id.)  Critically, this document is signed by “Lady Lyn C. Haltom”  along with “Joshua \nAdam Haltom” in a separate  signature  block .  (Id.)  Reading the memorandum in context with \nother filings, it is clear that this document was authored, argued, and signed by Mrs. Haltom.  ( Id.)  \nDefendants obje cted to the exhibits provided and the memorandum itself on several grounds.  (D.E. \n32 (citing Jackson v. Law Firm of O’Hara , 875 F.2d 1224, 1228 –29 (6th Cir. 1989) ). \nII. PROPOSED CONCLUSIONS OF LAW  \n“In determining whether a complaint fails to state a claim, the court must construe the \ncomplaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff[.]”  Payne  v. Sec’y  of Treasury , 73 Fed. App’x \n836, 837 (6th Cir. 2003).  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint need only \ncontain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  It need not contain  “detailed factual allegations,” Bell Atl. Corp.  v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007), but it must assert “more than an unadorned, the -defendant -unlawfully -\nharmed -me accusation.”  Ashcroft  v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “Following Twombly  and \nIqbal , it is well settled that a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible  on its face[.]”  Ctr. for Bio-Ethical  Reform,  Inc. v. \nNapolitano , 648 F.3d 365, 369 (6th Cir. 2011) (emphasis added).  A claim is plausible  when the \nalleged fact “allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  \nPro se complaints must also meet this plausibility standard. They are “not exempt from the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.”  Selmon -Austin  v. Wells  Fargo  Bank , No. 2:21 -cv-02724, 2022 \nWL 18141470, at *1 (W.D. Tenn. Sep. 7, 2022) (citing Wells  v. Brown , 891 F.2d 591, 594 (6th Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 7 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>8 \n Cir. 1989)).  Although “ pro se complaints are held to less stringent standards” and “should be \nliberally construed,” Williams  v. Curtin , 631 F.3d 380, 383 (6th Cir. 2011), courts do not “abrogate \n[the] basic pleading essentials in pro se suits.”  Wells , 891 F.2d at 594.  If essential elements are \nmissing, dismissal is warranted as a matter of law.  See Mayer  v. Mylod , 988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th \nCir. 1993) (explaining that the “purpose of Rule 12(b)(6) is to allow a defendant to test whether, \nas a matter of law, the plaintiff is entitled to legal relief even if everything alleged in the complaint \nis true.”).  \nAs a threshold matter, Plaintiff’s claims are limited to those provided  in his Complaint.2  \nThus, the claims are construed as violations of § 1983, the First Amendment, the Fourteenth \nAmendment, the ADA, UCC § 1-308, 18 U.S.C § 242 , barratry, and the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights, Article 13 .  (D.E. 1, 21.)   Plaintiff , through additional filings,  attempts to add Mrs. \nHaltom as a litigant  (D.E. 34 at 1, PageID 220 (citing D.E. 31)) , make a claim on behalf of his \nmother  (D.E. 17 at 2, PageID 74) , and bring additional claims that are not related to the original  \nComplaint . (D.E. 18; D.E. 33 at 1, PageID 217 .)  These claims  are disregarded because  he did not \nmove to amend his Complaint in accordance with Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) ( when a party fails to amend its pleading within 21 days of service, that “party \nmay amend its pleading only with the opposing party’s consent or the court’s leave.” (emphasis \nadded)).  This Court previously ordered Plaintiff to familiarize himself with the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure and he is “not exempt from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure”  simply based \non his pro se status.   Selmon -Austin , 2022 WL 18141470, at *1 ; (D.E. 22 at 1 –2.)  As such, there \n \n2  In light of  the less stringent  pleading  standard afforded  under Williams , 631 F.3d at 383, the \nundersigned finds that Plaintiff’s “Motion to Strike Color of Law Violations and for Relief in \nSupport of Constitutional Rights and Religious Freedom” clarifies some of the  legal theories \nPlaintiff likely intended to raise in his Complaint .  (D.E. 21.)   Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 8 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>9 \n is no excuse for Plaintiff to be unaware of his obligation to assert new claims on behalf of himself \nor for any other person in a manner  that compl ies with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.   \nThis Court disregards Plaintiff’s pleas to consider ecclesiastical and divine law because \n“[c]ivil judges obviously do not have the competence of ecclesiastical tribunals in applying the \n‘law’ that governs ecclesiastical disputes .”  Serbian E. Orthodox , 426 U.S. at 714, n. 8; see also \nMd. & Va. Eldership of Churches of God v. Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc. , 396 U.S. 367, 369 \n(1970) (Brennan, J. concurring) (“ To permit civil courts to probe deeply enough into the allocation \nof power within a church so as to decide where religious law places control over the use of church \nproperty would violate the First Amendment in much the same manner as civil determination of \nreligious doctrine .” (emphasis added)).   \nAdditionally, this Court disregards  Plaintiff’s “Memorandum in Support of Opposition to \nMotion to Dismiss.”  (D.E. 31.)  This memorandum was  clearly authored and  signed  by Mrs. \nHaltom, who is neither a party in this case nor is she an attorney representing the Plaintiff.   (Id. at \n11, PageID 190. )  “A non -lawyer may not represent another non -lawyer in connection with a \nmatter pending in federal court.  This is so even if such representation is purportedly authorized \nby a power of attorney or other agreement.”  Brown v. Bobbett , No. 2:20 -cv-01278 -JDT-cgc, 2021 \nWL 982335, at *1 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 16, 2021) (collecting cases); Carouthers v. Comm'r of Soc. \nSec., No. 2:20 -CV-02705 -TLP-atc, 2023 WL 2028934, at *11 (W.D. Tenn. Jan. 23, 2023), report \nand recommendation adopted , No. 2:20 -cv-02705 -TLP-atc, 2023 WL 2024293 (W.D. Tenn. Feb. \n15, 2023).  Under 28 U.S.C. § 1654, “[i]n all courts of the United States the parties may plead and \nconduct their own cases personally or by counsel . . . .”   Because Mrs. Haltom is neither a party in \nthis case, nor is she Plaintiff’s  attorney, the response she signed must be disregarded .  See Fed. R. Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 9 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>10 \n Civ. P. 11(a)  (“The court must strike an unsigned paper unless the omission is promptly corrected \nafter being called to the attorney’s or party’s attention.”)3   \nBecause the response authored by Mrs. Haltom to Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is \ndisregarded , the Court liberally construes the numerous  post-motion  filings by the Plaintiff as a \ncollective response to the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.  (See D.E. 25, 27, 33, 34, 38, 39, 44 , \n48.)  However, d iscovery has not initiated in this case , so all motions filed by Plaintiff concerning \ndiscovery or other tangential evidentiary disputes are disregarded as moot in light of the \nrecommendation provided below.   (See D.E. 28, 29, 35, 36, 39, 41, 42, 46.)    \n The Court first turns to the constitutional  claims, before addressing the remaining claims.  \nA.  City of Henderson, Tennessee, Police Department  \n 1.  Henderson Police Department is not a Suable Entity  \nPlaintiff’s claims against the Henderson Police Department  fail because  a police or \nsheriff’s department “is not a suable entity under Tennessee law.”   Boyd v. City of Millington , No. \n15-cv-2642 -SHL -cgc, 2015 WL 13080882, at *1 (W.D. Tenn. Dec. 9, 2015).  The Sixth Circuit \nhas held “that ‘[s]ince the [p]olice [d]epartment is not an entity which may be sued, [the] [c]ounty \nis the proper party to address the allegations of [the plai ntiff's] complaint.’”  Kindle v. City of \nJeffersontown, Ky. , 374 Fed.Appx. 562 , 570 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Matthews v. Jones , 35 F.3d \n1046, 1049 (6th Cir. 1994) ); see also Jones v. Union Cnty. , Tenn., 296 F.3d 417, 422 –23 (6th Cir. \n2002) (explaining that the plaintiff, who conceded in her response to the defendants' motion for \nsummary judgment that a Tennessee county “[s] heriff's [d]epartment could not be sued,” did not \n \n3  Mrs. Haltom’s filing would not change  the legal analysis provided herein  even  if it were \nconsidered.  The filing merely restates Mrs. Haltom’s court observations and provides additional \ninformation on Plaintiff’s ADA claim.  For the reasons provided below, Plaintiff’s ADA claim fails \nbecause he was never barred from meaningful acce ss to traffic court a public entity.  Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 10 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>11 \n appeal the district court's “ruling that [the] [p]laintiff's 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim against the \n[s]heriff's [d]epartment was dismissed because under Matthews v. Jones , 35 F.3d 1046, 1049 (6th \nCir. 1994), a county sheriff's department could not be sued”).  \nAt the district court level, “Tennessee federal courts have routinely held that police \ndepartments cannot be sued.”  Moore v. Henderson Cnty. Sheriff's Dep't , No. 13 -1243, 2014 WL \n1745017, at *13 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 30, 2014) (collecting cases) (granting the “[d]efendants ’ motion \nfor summary judgment on all claims against the [city] [p]olice [d]epartment” because “the [c]ity . \n. . and not the [p]olice [d]epartment, is ‘the proper party to address the allegations of [the] \ncomplaint’” (quoting Matthew v. Jones , 35 F.3d at 1049)); see Grace v. City of Ripley, Tenn. , No. \n2:16-cv-02395 -JPM-dkv, 2017 WL 835206, at *5, n.2 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 2, 2017) (“Since the Sixth \nCircuit's decision in Matthews, district courts in Tennessee have frequently and uniformly held \nthat police departments and sheriff's departments are not pr oper parties to a § 1983 suit.”).  “Under \nTennessee law, a police department is not an entity separate from a municipality that is capable of \nbeing sued.”  Boyd , 2015 WL 13080882, at *2 (citation omitted ) (ruling that “as a mere municipal \ndepartment with no legal identity separate from that of the [c]ity .  . . [its] [p]olice [d]epartment \n[was] not a proper defendant”).   For this reason, it is recommended that Plaintiff’s claims against \nthe Henderson Police Department be dismissed.   \n2.  Any Construed Monell Claim is Fatally Flawed  \nTo the extent that this Court could construe Plaintiff’s claim s to be  Monell  claim s against \nthe City of Henderson, the Plaintiff never amended his complaint to bring claims against the City \nof Henderson, Tennessee.  In fact, in the Complaint and most filings, Plaintiff consistently asserts \nthat his claims are directed toward the Henderson Police Department, and not the City of \nHenderson itself.  (D.E. 1, 11, 12, 16, 17, 19, 25, 33, 35, 36, 38, 42, 44, 46.)  Even if Plaintiff had Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 11 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>12 \n amended the Complaint , as required by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendants properly \nnote that he has not presented any sufficiently alleged facts  that the City of Henderson has a policy, \ncustom, or procedure that caused a violation of a constitutional right.  D’Ambrosio v. Marino , 747 \nF.3d 378, 386 (6th Cir. 2014); Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of N.Y.C. , 436 U.S. 658, 694 –95 \n(1978); see Ctr. for Bio-Ethical  Reform , 648 F.3d at 369 (“it is well settled that a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible  on its \nface[.]”); (D.E. 24 -1 at 4 –5, PageID 98 –99.)   \nPlaintiff’s only factual basis for a Monell  claim, provided in a request for expedited relief  \nrather than  his Complaint , alleges  that the Henderson Police Department “denied Plaintiff’s \nlawfully obtained clergy identification, burdening his religious exercise” rights and accepts “non -\ngovernmental IDs from others, signaling discriminatory intent. ”  (D.E. 41 at 1.)   A municipality  \ncannot be sued under  Monell  based on the theory that the city employs a party that caused injury ; \nrather, a Plaintiff must assert that the municipality is the “moving force behind the injury.”  Fox. \nv. Van Oosterum , 176 F.3d 342, 348 (6th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation omitted) (citing Bd. Of \nCnty. Comm’rs of Bryan Cnty ., Okla. v. Brown , 520 U.S.  397, 403 (1997) ; Yahoshua -Yisrael: \nYahweh v. City of Memphi s, No. 12 -2897, 2014 WL 1689715, at *7 (W.D. Tenn. Apr. 29, 2014).   \nPlaintiff specifically alleges that “ CHPD [ Henderson Police Department ] rejected Plaintiff’s \ncredentials while accepting non -governmental IDs from others.”  (D.E. 41 at 1.)  However, t here \nis no allegation  by the Plaintiff  that the City of Henderson is the moving force behind the  purported  \ndiscriminatory treatment , meaning that his Monell claim is insufficient on its face .  Additionally, \nthere is no underlying constitutional deprivation from the traffic stop because under Tennessee \nState law and Sixth Circuit precedence, no individual has a right to operate a motor vehicle wit hout \na valid, state -issued license.  Duncan v. Cone , No. 00 -5705, 2000 WL 1828089 (Table) , at *2 (6th Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 12 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>13 \n Cir. Dec. 7, 2000); Dunn v. Post , No. 21 -1412, 2022 WL 1297586, at *2 (6th Cir. Jan. 27, 2022);  \nsupra Section II.C.  See generally State v. Booher , 978 S.W.2d 953, 955 –957 (Tenn. Crim. App. \n1997).    \nHere, all of Plaintiff’s  claims against the Henderson Police Department should  be \ndismissed.  First and foremost, t he Henderson Police Department is not an individual entity that \nmay be subject to a lawsuit .  Second,  there are insufficient factual or legal grounds to construe any \nof the claims against the Henderson Police Department as Monell  claim s against the City of \nHenderson .   \nB.  Judge Chip Sherrod  \nIt is well established that judicial officers are generally entitled to absolute immunity from \nsuits arising out of the performance of their judicial functions.   Brookings v. Clunk , 389 F.3d 614, \n617 (6th Cir. 2004) .  They are accorded this broad protection , in part,  to ensure that the independent \nand impartial exercise of their judgment in a case is not impaired by the exposure to damages by \ndissatisfied litigants.  Barnes  v. Winchell , 105 F.3d 1111,  1115  (6th Cir. 1997) .  For this reason, \nabsolute immunit y is overcome only when (1) the conduct alleged is performed at a time when the \ndefendant is not acting as a judge; or (2) the conduct alleged, although judicial in nature, is taken \nin complete absence of all subject matter jurisdiction of the court over w hich he or she presides.  \nBrookings , 389 F.3d at 617;  Mireles , 502 U.S.  9, 11–12 (1991) ; Barnes , 105 F.3d at 1116.  A judge \nwill not be deprived of immunity even if the action at issue was performed in error, done \nmaliciously, or was in excess of his or he r authority.   Stump v. Sparkman , 435 U.S. 349, 356 \n(1978); Sevier v. Turner , 742 F.2d 262, 271 (6th Cir. 1984) (holding that merely acting in excess \nof authority does not preclude immunity).  Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 13 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>14 \n Looking to the Complaint and relevant  filings, there are no factual allegations that Judge \nSherrod took any adverse actions against the Plaintiff outside the context of the June 19, 2024, \ncourt proceedings.  Plaintiff ’s claims  appear to  solely  take umbrage with the Judge’s management \nof the courtroom, decision to render a judgment as to the traffic violations, and the  issuance of \ncontempt penalties .  (D.E. 1; D.E. 9 -2.)  The first two issues clearly qualify as judicial functions.  \nThe issuance of a contempt  fine during a state court proceeding is  also clearly within the proscribed  \npowers of  a judicial officer  in state court matters.  See Tenn. Code Ann. §  29-9-102(1) (explaining \nthat the power of the court to inflict punishments for contempt of court extends to “[t] he willful \nmisbehavior of any person in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct the \nadministration of justice .”)  Therefore, Plaintiff  has not established that Judge Sherrod  acted \noutside of the subject matter jurisdiction of the court over which he preside s.  Judge Sherr od is  \ntherefore absolutely immune from  all claims against him.   Brookings , 389 F.3d at 617.  \nC.  Officers Cook, Holloway, and Heathcock  \n Plaintiff alleges various constitutional claims against the individual officers, appearing to \nbring the claims  under 42 U.S.C. § 1983  and Ex parte Young .  (D.E. 21 at 2, PageID 85; D.E. 44 \nat 2–3, PageID 257 –258.)   As demonstrated by the analysis provided herein, Plaintiff’s  claim s for \ninjunctive relief against the Officers  are frivolous and thus do not fall within Ex parte Young .  See \nPearlman v. Vigil -Giron , 71 Fed. App’x 11, 14 (10th Cir 2003) (holding that if a claim is barred \nunder the Eleventh Amendment because it is frivolous, then the claims will fall outside the scope \nof Ex parte Young .  Further, “[a] claim is insubstantial and frivolous if it is obviously without merit \nor foreclosed by prior authoritative decisions .” (emphasis added) (internal quotation omitted) ).  \nThe anal ysis herein clearly demonstrates that Plaintiff’s  claims are “ foreclosed by prior \nauthoritative decisions .”  Id. Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 14 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>15 \n To successfully plead a § 1983 claim, a plaintiff must allege (1) a deprivation of a right \nsecured by the Constitution or laws of the United States and (2) the deprivation was caused by a \nperson acting under color of state law.  Tahfs v. Proctor , 316 F. 3d 584, 590 (6th Cir. 2003).  \nSection  1983 does not create substantive rights, but it “provides remedies for deprivations of rights \nestablished elsewhere.”   Flint v. Kentucky Dep't of Corr. , 270 F.3d 340, 351 (6th Cir.2001) (citing \nOkla . City v. Tuttle , 471  U.S. 808 (1985)).   As far as the undersigned can determine, the Plaintiff  \nalleges that the Officers were acting under color of law when they stopped his vehicle, issued \ntickets to him and his family members, refused to accept his “clergy ID,” and seized the License \nPlate.  (D.E. 1; D.E. 21 ).  Plaintiff alleges that there were deprivations of his rights secured by the \nConstitution via restrictions on his right to travel, interference with the exercise of his religion, and \nviolation of equal protection on account of religious identity and disa bility.  (See D.E. 21 at 2, \nPageID 85.)     \nPublic officials may raise the affirmative defense of qualified immunity in cases seeking \ncivil damages when the official’s conduct does not violate “clearly established statutory or \nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.”  Pearson v. Callahan , 555 \nU.S. 223, 231 (2009).  Qualified immunity is examined under a two-step analysis , which may be \nconducted in any order.  Id. at 236.  That two -step analysis requires the court to determine (1) \nwhether  “the facts alleged show the office r’s conduct violated a constitutional right” and (2) \nwhether the right was “clearly established” at the time of the alleged violation.  Godawa v. Byrd , \n798 F.3d 457, 463 (6th Cir. 2015) (citing Cass v. City of Dayton , 770 F.3d 368, 374 (6th Cir. \n2014)).   A right is clearly established if “it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct \nwas unlawful in the situation he confronted .”  Humphrey v. Marby , 482 F.3d 840, 847 (6th Cir. \n2007) (internal quotation omitted).  Once qualified immunity is raise d, the plaintiff bears the Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 15 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>16 \n burden of showing that the officer is not entitled to qualified immunity.  Campbell v. Mack , 777 \nFed. App’x 122, 131 (6th Cir. 2019).     \n 1.  Officers did not Violate Plaintiff’s Right to Travel  \nThe Plaintiff has no constitutional or statutory right to drive with an unofficial or \nunauthorized license plate.  In Tennessee, an individual’s vehicle must be registered and must have \na displayed, state -issued license plate.  Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 55 -4-101, 55-5-114(d).  No vehicle \nmay be operated on the roadways absent a properly displayed “registration plate,” and a violation \nof the statute is “a Class C misdemeanor.”  Tenn . Code Ann. § 55 -5-114(d).   No individual has a \nright , constitutional or otherwise,  to operate a motor vehicle without a valid, state -issued license.   \nDuncan , 2000 WL 1828089 (Table) , at *2; Dunn 2022 WL 1297586, at *2 ; United States v. \nWarfield , 404 F. App'x 994, 996 (6th Cir. 2011) ; cf. Yashar’al v. City of Indianapolis , No. 1:20 -\ncv-02988 -SEB-MPB, 2022 WL 22381338, at *2 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 7, 2022) (“ Plaintiffs have no \nconstitutional or statutory right to drive with an unofficial, unauthorized license plate.  . . . the act \nof displaying a fictitious license plate is a class C infraction und er Indiana law. ”).  See generally \nBooher , 978 S.W.2d at 955–957. \nPlaintiff incorrectly states that Tenn. Code Ann. §  55-4-252 allows for individuals to self -\nissue “clergy license plates.”  (D.E. 27 at 1, PageID 151.)  After a thorough review of Tennessee \nlicense plate laws, Plaintiff appears t o misunderstand the laws .  First, the current iteration of § 55 -\n4-202 concerns “Special License Plates” for United State s military members, not clergy members.  \nTenn. Code Ann.  § 55 -4-252.  Second, a cross  Tennessee’s special license plate code , there is \nabsolutely no reference to c lergy license plates.  Tenn. Code Ann. §§  55-4-201–299.  The only \nreference the undersigned could find related to clergy license plates comes from a now -removed  \namendment from 1998 which allows the state “to authorize the issuance of special license plates Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 16 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>17 \n for members of the clergy.”  SB 1651, 100th Gen. Assem. (1998) (enacted).  Section 3 of the \namending bill specifically states: “[m] embers of the clergy . . ., upon complying with state motor \nvehicle laws relating to registration and licensing of motor vehicles , and paying the regular fee \napplicable to motor vehicles and the fee provided for in Section 55 -4-203, shall be issued a special \nlicense plate  authorized by this section .”  Id. (emphasis added).  It appears that the Tennessee code \nhas never allowed for clergy members to self -issue license plates, as Plaintiff did here .  Id.; See \nTenn. Code Ann. §§ 55 -4-201–299.    \n Plaintiff alleg es that the Officers violated his constitutional rights by pulling him over, \nseizing the License Plate , and  issuing citations for failure to possess and display a state -issued tag \nand a state -issued driver’s license.  This does not  establish that the Officers  violate d his \nConstitutional right to travel.  Although Plaintiff states, “[c]hurches are [] able to travel without \ngovernment interference,” Plaintiff clearly confuses the right to travel with the privilege to drive \nan automobile.  Yaho sua-Yisrael: Yahweh , 2014 WL 1689715, at *7.  “A burden on a single mode \nof transportation simply does not implicate the right to interstate travel.”   Duncan , 2000 WL \n1828089 (Table) , at *2.  Traffic citations issued against an individual for offenses committed while \ndriving an automobile in violation of the law do not impinge upon a person's —or a church’s —\nconstitutional right to travel.   See, e.g., Murphy v. Koster , No. 5:10 CV 2095, 2010 WL 5147215, \nat *5 (N.D.  Ohio Dec. 13, 2000).   Plaintiff has no const itutional right to operate a vehicle without \na state -issued license plate or a state -issued identification , so the Officers are entitled to qualified \nimmunity because the facts alleged show the Officers’ conduct did not violate a constitutional \nright.4  Accordingly, it is recommended that Plaintiff’s claim that the Officers violated his \n \n4  Because one prong of the qualified immunity analysis fails, the Court need not analyze whether \nthe right was “clearly established” at the time of the alleged violation.  Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 17 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>20 \n Equal Protection Clause safeguards against the disparate treatment of similarly situated individuals \nas a result of government action that ‘either burdens a fundamental right, targets a suspect class, \nor has no rational basis.’” Paterek v. Vill. of Armada, Mich ., 801 F.3d 630, 649 (6th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting Ctr. for Bio –Ethical Reform, Inc , 648 F.3d  at 379).      \nFirst and foremost, Plaintiff fails to provide a plausible factual basis that he was treated \ndifferently than a similarly situated person.  Regardless of Plaintiff’s framing of the relevant traffic \nstops, citations, and seizure of his clergy identification and License Plate, the reality is that Plaintiff \nwas pulled over for violating Tennessee motor vehicle laws.  (D.E. 9 -2, at 2 (“the officer [] cited \nhim [for] crossing the right line[.]”); D.E. 9 -3 at 2 (showing a citation on May 19, 2024, for \n“DRIVING ON  RIGHT SIDE OF ROA[D]”).  He does not provide any factual basis that other \nmotorists presenting self -printed driver’s licenses or displaying self -printed licenses plates are \ntreated differently than he is.  In fact, this District has ruled on similarly situated individuals that \nfail to produce state -issued license plates and identifications.  Yahoshua -Yisrael: Yahweh , WL \n1689715; Eshleman v. Chester County , No. 1:15 -cv-1106 -JDT-egb, 2015 WL 13744665 (W.D. \nTenn. Nov. 17, 2015).  These individuals faced the same consequences, indicating that Plaintiff \nwas treated the same as others that fail to follow Tennessee’s motor vehicle registration laws.  \nEven if there were facts indicating an Equal Protection violation, Plaintiff  fails to provide \nany factual nexus tying his religion or his disability to the reason for the traffic stop  or the reason \nfor the seizure of his unlawful identification and license plate .  This means that Plaintiff could not \nprove that the Officers violated a clearly established constitutional Equal Protection right.  As \npreviously stated, no individual has a right , constitutional or otherwise,  to operate a motor vehicle \nwithout obeying the general criminal prohibitions on driving a car without a  valid, state -issued \nlicense  and license plate .  Duncan , 2000 WL 1828089 (Table) , at *2; Dunn , 2022 WL 1297586, Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 20 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>21 \n at *2 . See generally Booher , 978 S.W.2d at 955–957.  It is obvious to a reasonable observer that \nPlaintiff’s religion and disability were entirely unknown to police officers when they conducted \nthe traffic stop  on May 19, 2024 .6  For that reason, it cannot be reasonabl y argued that it was “clear \nto a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.”  Humphrey \nv. Marby , 482 F.3d 840, 847 (6th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation omitted).   \nFor these reasons,  qualified immunity shields the Officers from liability and Plaintiff fails \nto provide sufficient facts leading to a plausible Equal Protection claim .  Thus, it is recommended \nthat the Plaintiff’s Equal Protection claim be dismissed . \nD.  Miscellaneous Remaining Claims  \n 1.  18 U.S.C. §242  \n18 U.S.C. § 242 provides, in relevant part:  \nWhoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, \nwillfully subjects any person in any State… to the deprivation of any rights, \nprivileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the \nUnited States, . . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one \nyear, or both; and if bodily injury results from the acts committed in violation of \nthis section or if such acts include the use, attempted use, or threatened use of a \ndangerous weapon, explo sives, or fire, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned \nnot more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in \nviolation of this section . . . shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned for any \nterm of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.  \n \nWhile 18 U.S.C. § 242 makes it a crime for someone acting under color of law to willfully deprive \na person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, Plaintiff  \nlacks standing to bring an 18 U.S.C. § 242 claim.   Only the United States Attorney can initiate \n \n6  Generally, an officer may stop a vehicle for a civil infraction, such as a traffic violation, based \nupon probable cause.  United States v. Collazo , 818, F.3d 247 253 –54 (6th Cir. 2016).  Probable \ncause exists when facts and circumstances within an officer’s knowledge are sufficient to lead a \nreasonable person to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.  Campbell v. Mack , \n777 Fed. App’x 122, 131 (citing Safford Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 v. Redding, 557 U.S. 364, 370 \n(2009).    Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 21 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>22 \n criminal charges in federal court.  28 U.S.C. § 547; Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c).   For this reason, it is \nrecommended that Plaintiff’s 18 U.S.C. § 242  claim be dismissed.  \n2.  UCC § 1 -308 \nPlaintiff’s allegations that the Henderson Police Department is violating the UCC is also \nentirely devoid of merit.  The Court is entirely unable to infer a plausible cause of action under the \nUCC because there is no factual basis to conclude that a contra ctual or sales transaction is at issue \nbetween Plaintiff and the Henderson Police Department.  See e.g. Pounds v. Charter Twp. Of \nKalamazoo , 1:25 -cv-187, 2025 WL 977487, at *1, n. 1 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 5, 2025) (“[T] he Court \nnotes that including ‘UCC 1 -308’ i s a frequent and common tactic by those who adhere to the \nsovereign citizen movement.   This reference ‘appears to refer to some sort of reservation of rights. ’  \nThe purpose of Rule 11 is undermined when filers, such as plaintiff, seek to ‘reserve [his] rights’ \nand thereby avoid the penalty such consequences.   See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) –(c).”) (internal \nquotations and citations omitted).   Thus, it is recommended that Plaintiff’s UCC claim be \ndismissed.   \n3.  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  \nPlaintiff’s claim under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights fails to state a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not a treaty or \ninternational agreement that imposes legal obligations. See Sosa v. Alvarez -Machain , 542 U.S. \n692, 734 (2004) (“[T]he Declaration does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of \ninternational law.”).   Thus, it is recommended that this claim dismissed.  \n 4.  Title II of the ADA  \nPlaintiff ’s ADA claim fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Plaintiff most \nlikely intended to bring a Title II claim, which specifics that “no qualified individual with a Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 22 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>23 \n disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination \nby any such entity.”   42 U.S.C § 12132.  Here, Plaintiff d oes not allege  that he was excluded from \nparticipation of a service, program, or activity ; instead,  Plaintiff s allegations appear twofold.  First, \nit appears  that Plaintiff is arguing that his disability  absolves him of  the traffic court’s finding of \ncontempt .  This argument is denied on its face as devoid of merit.  Second, Plaintiff seems to allege \nthat the Defendants failed to provide reasonable accommodations .  (D.E. 1, D.E. 34, at 2, PageID \n221.)   \nThe Sixth Circuit has held:  \nTitle II does not require a plaintiff to receive [his] “preferred” \naccommodation, but merely a reasonable one that provides “meaningful access” to \nthe public entity. The determination of what constitutes a reasonable \naccommodation is highly fact -specific, requiring case -by-case inquiry.  \n \nBennett v. Hurley Med. Ctr. , 86 F.4th 314, 326 (6th Cir. 2023) (internal quotations and citations \nomitted ).  Looking to the facts of this case, Plaintiff was issued citations for traffic violations.  \nThese violations were clearly communicated in an  effective manner, as Plaintiff arrived at traffic \ncourt  on the designated date , and he was  prepared to present argument protesting the citations.  \n(See generally D.E. 9 -2.)  Plaintiff sat patiently  and waited for his case to be called .  (Id.)  When \nhis case was called, Plaintiff apparently pleaded his religious objections to the court .  (Id.)  The \ncourt was unconvinced by his argument and ruled against him.  (Id.)  Plaintiff, understanding that \nthe citations would stand, then asked for  the License Plate  to be returned  while professing his intent \nto flout the law in the future.  (Id.)  These facts all clearly indicate that Plaintiff was provided with \nmeaningful access  to traffic court to plead his case .  Whatever Plaintiff’s preferred accommodation \nwas at the time is irrelevant because only “meaningful access” is necessary.  Id.   None o f the facts Case 1:24-cv-01215-STA-jay     Document 49     Filed 05/13/25     Page 23 of 24 \nPageID <pageID>24 \n alleged give rise to plausible ADA claim; thus, it is recommended that the Plaintiff’s ADA claim \nbe dismissed.  \n 5.  Barratry  \n Plaintiff asserts that the Defendants committed barratry against him, but Plaintiff fails to \npoint to any federal or Tennessee law that allows for a civil action of barratry.  This Court notes \nthat a federal court in Tennessee previously held that a criminal barratry statute  was \nunconstitutional.  See generally ACLU of Tenn. v. Tennessee , 502 F. Supp. 388 (M.D. Tenn. 1980).  \nPlaintiff has therefore failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.  It is recommended \nthat Plaintiff’s barratry claim be dismissed.   \nIII. RECOMMENDATION  \nFor the above stated reasons, all of Plaintiff’s claims fail to state a plausible claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted.  Thus, the undersigned RECOMMENDS that Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss be GRANTED  and Plaintiff’s suit be DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE . \n \nRespectfully submitted, this, the 13th day of May 2025.  \ns/Jon A.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Shanicqua Bryant brings multiple claims against the Pottsgrove School District and Dr. Ann Marie Lucas, alleging constitutional violations, defamation, and other wrongs following incidents involving her disabled son, a false police report, and proselytization by a teacher. The use of AI tools was highlighted in the case as Bryant, a frequent pro se litigant, quickly filed a response that raised concerns about the reliance on AI like ChatGPT for legal drafting, which could generate unreliable content. The court dismissed some claims but allowed others to proceed, particularly focusing on due process violations and retaliation claims under the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Bryant has standing to bring claims against the school district and its officials for alleged constitutional violations and other disputes, and the sufficiency of her complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court partially granted the motion to dismiss, rejecting claims under the Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses for failure to state a claim, retaining due process and § 504 retaliation claims against the school district, and granting qualified immunity on certain claims for Dr. Lucas. Claims against the school district under state law torts were dismissed with prejudice due to immunity under the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're a parent who believes your child's school did some bad things, like lying and trying to convert your child to a different religion. You decide to take the school to court without a lawyer, but your legal paperwork isn't super clear or detailed. The judge throws out some of your complaints because they aren't backed up well, but lets you keep arguing that the school didn't treat you fairly in some ways. Throughout all this, the court pretty much says: using computer programs to write legal stuff might help, but they can't replace a real lawyer's understanding.",
    "full_text": "1 \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA  \n \nSHANICQUA BRYANT,  \nPlaintiff , \n \nv. \n \nPOTTSGROVE SCHOOL DISTRICT and  \nANN MARIE LUCAS in her personal and \nofficial capacities,  \nDefendants . CIVIL  ACTION  \n   \n \nNo. 25-3140 \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nPlaintiff Shanicqua Bryant, proceeding pro se , brings this case against Defendants \nPottsgrove School District (the “School District” or “District”) and Dr. Ann Marie Lucas in both \nher personal and official capacities  asserting:1 (1) constitutional claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983 for violations of her Establishment Clause, equal protection, and due process rights ; (2) a \nclaim under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a) ; (3) statutory perjury \nclaims under 18 U.S.C. § 1621 and 18 Pa.

However, v iewing \nthe allegations in a light most favorable to her, it could be concluded that she is bringing all of them  against both \nDefendants.  Moreover, because Bryant sued Lucas in both her personal and official capacities, the official -capacity \nclaims will be treated as claims against Lucas’ municipal employer, the School District.  See Kentucky v. Graham , \n473 U.S. 159, 165 -66 (1985) (“Official -capacity suits . . . ‘generally represent only another way of pleading an \naction against an entity of which an officer is an agent.’” (quoting Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. of N.Y. , 436 U.S. \n658, 690 n.55 (1978)) ); see e.g., Byars v. Sch. Dist. of Phila. , 942 F. Supp.2d 552, 569- 70 (E.D. Pa. 2013) (assessing \nFirst Amendment claims brought against school district employees in their official capacity as claims against the \nschool district itself) . \n2 It is unclear whether Bryant seeks to raise these claims on her own behalf  or on behalf of her minor child.  To the \nextent Bryant seeks to raise any claims on behalf of her minor child, she is prohibited from doing so.  A pro se  \nlitigant who is not an attorney may not pursue claims on behalf of anyone other than herself.  Accordingly, because \nBryant is appearing pro se  and is not an attorney, she may not bring claims on behalf of her minor child.   See Osei -\nAfriyie ex rel. Osei -Afriyie v. Med. Coll. of Pa. , 937 F.2d 876, 882- 83 (3d Cir. 1991) .  Bryant, who has filed many \nsuits concerning the education of her son, has been told repeatedly that she cannot sue on her son’s behalf.  See, e.g. , \n Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 1 of 242 \n Defendants have filed a Motion to D ismiss premised on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rules \n12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).3  For the following reasons, the Court will grant  in part  and deny in part \ntheir motion.  \n FACTUAL  BACKGROUND \nThe following allegations are taken from Bryant ’s Amended  Complaint, well- pleaded \nallegations from which are taken as true at this stage.  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, \n210-11 (3d Cir. 2009).  \n The Amended Complaint is about as  bare bone s as it can be, setting out a number of \nincidents without any great detail:  \n• Bryant has a disabled son whom  she enrolled in the District for the 2023- 24 school year .  \n• On or about September 20, 2024, Lucas  directed one of her subordinates to file a false \npolice report with the Lower Pottsgrove Police against Bryant .  The District denied \nresponsibility for making the statements in the report  and accused the police of false \n \nBryant v. Pottstown Sch. Dist. , 2025 WL 602160, at *1 n.1 (3d Cir. Feb. 25, 2025); Bryant v. Pottstown Sch. Dist. , \n2022 WL 3722084 , at *2 n.4 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 29, 2022) ; Bryant v. Pottstown Sch. Dist. , 2021 WL 4893368 , at *3 n.3 \n(E.D. Pa. Oct. 20, 2021); Aponte v. Pottstown  Sch. Dist. , 2019 WL 3080938, at *1 (E.D. Pa. July 12, 2019).  \n3 Defendants filed their M otion to D ismiss on July 17, 2025.  Bryant filed her response just two days later.  To \nrespond so quickly would be a remarkable feat if done by a lawyer.  When done by a pro se  litigant, it strains \ncredulity.  \nThe proliferation of artificial intelligence tools, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT product, will undoubtedly change the \nlegal profession.  The technology is poised to facilitate legal research, drafting, and compliance with the law.  But a \nmachine is no substitu te for a lawyer, or even for a frequent pro se litigant such as Bryant .  ChatGPT has a well -\ndocumented tendency of generating fake cases in response to law -related prompts.  See, e.g. , Bunce v. Visual Tech. \nInnovations, Inc. , 2025 WL 662398, at *1, 4 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 27, 2025) (sanctioning a lawyer who relied on ChatGPT \nbecause two separate motions contained “hallucinat[ed]” and misrepresented cases).  Moreover, even when ChatGPT generates real cases, those cases may be inapplicable because th e technology does not , for example, \nautomatically grasp common law principles, our system of authorities , or the nuances that divide distinguishable \nfrom on -point cases .   \nDangers lurk, and pro se litigants without legal training are especially vulnerable to being misled.  Yet, like \nattorneys, they still must comply with court rules and orders.  Mala  v. Crown Bay Marina, Inc. , 704 F.3d 239, 245 \n(3d Cir. 2013) (“ At the end of the day, [pro se  litigants]  cannot flout procedural rules —they must abide by the same \nrules that apply to all other litigants. ”); accord Ross -Briscoe v. Klaus , 538 F.3d 252, 258 (3d Cir. 2008) (concluding \na pro se plaintiff was personally responsible for their failure to attend a pretrial conference or otherwise comply with \na court order); Campbell v. LVNV Funding, LLC , 2022 WL 6172286, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 7, 2022) (“[ P]ro se  \nlitigants must generally comply with local rules .” (citations omitted)).  That compliance includes ensuring that “ the \nclaims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for \nextending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law .”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2).  Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 2 of 243 \n reporting.  Bryant, however, received assurance from the police department that the \naccusations were documented as reported by the District.  \n• In November 2024, there was a “due process” hearing regarding Bryant’s  son’s education \nand the police report.4  Bryant alleges that Lucas  and other individuals from the District \nperjured themselves at that hearing by lying “under oath.”  Bryant seems to allege that their conduct was part of a broader conspiracy by Lucas  and district staff to target her  and \nher son through lies and other unarticulated conduct.  \n• Bryant further alleges that the District allowed a teacher to proselytize Islam to her son.   \nWhile  the District does not offer classes on Islamic studies , the teacher bought her son \nIslamic clothing and items .  Bryant says her son “brought those ideas and belief s to my \nhome,” which led to distress and arguments with her son about religion. \n DISCUSSION  \nA. 12(b)(1)  \nThe gist of Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(1) argument is that Bryant does not have standing to \npursue her Establishment Clause claim.5 \n \n4 The Amended Complaint states the hearing was in November 2025, but because that date has yet to occur , the \nCourt assumes Bryant  meant November 2024.  Moreover, given the paucity of the Amended Complaint’s \nallegations, the Court  can only make an  educated guess that the “due process” hearing Bryant refers to is that \nprovided for by  the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq.  (“IDEA”).   See 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1415(f) . \n5 Defendants also move to dismiss Bryant’s § 504 and perjury claims under Rule 12(b)(1).  They contend that \nBryant lacks standing to pursue her § 504 claim because she fails to allege the elements for such a claim.  Similarly, \nthey argue she lacks standing to pursue a perjury claim because there is no private cause of action for such a claim.  \nAlthough nominally attacks to jurisdiction, these arguments fundamentally challenge the sufficiency of Bryant’s \nallegations; they are more appropriately raised under R ule 12(b)(6).  \nThe choice of which rule to apply is significant because of the “myriad procedural differences” between 12(b)(1) \nand 12(b)(6), such as when a motion  can be raised and who bears the burden of persuasion.  Potter v. Cozen & \nO’Connor , 46 F.4th 148, 155  (3d Cir. 2022) .  More importantly, the question raised by a 12(b)(1) motion—whether \na federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over a claim —is “antecedent to [ a court’s] power to reach the merits of \nthat claim” under a 12(b)(6) motion.  Finkelman v. NFL , 810 F.3d 187, 193 (3d Cir. 2016) .  Accordingly, because \nDefendants’ § 504 and perjury arguments are not challenges to the Court’s “very power to hear the case,” Mortensen \nv. First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass ’n, 549 F.2d 884, 891 (3d Cir. 1977) , they are improperly raised under Rule 12(b)(1).  \nSee Davis v. Wells Fargo , 824 F.3d 333, 346 -50 (3d Cir. 2016) ( holding that the district court “erroneously \naccepted” the argument that a plaintiff lacked standing because he had sued the wrong corporate entity, framing the issue of whom the plaintiff could hold responsible as a “merits question” to be addressed under  12(b)(6)); cf. Off. \nComm. of Unsecured Creditors v. R.F. Lafferty & Co. , 267 F.3d 340, 346 (3d Cir. 2001) (“Whether a party has \nstanding to bring claims and whether a party’ s claims are barred by an equitable defense are two separate questions, \nto be addressed on their own terms.”) .  Nevertheless, because Defendants repeat their contentions under 12(b)(6), \nthey will be evaluated under that framework.  \nBy contrast, Defendants properly move under 12(b)(1) to dismiss Bryant’s Establishment Clause claim .  Their \n Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 3 of 244 \n i. Legal Standard  \nRule 12(b)(1) allows a defendant to move to dismiss a complaint for “lack of subject -\nmatter jurisdiction.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  W ant of Article III standing is properly brought \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) because Article III provides “jurisdictional limitation[s]” that implicate \n“the Court ’s power to hear” claims.  Potter , 46 F.4th at 154- 57; Ballentine v. United States , 486 \nF.3d 806, 810 (3d Cir. 2007).  Here, Defendants launch a facial attack on Bryant’s standing to pursue her Establishment Clause claim in that they “contest [] the sufficiency of the pleadings.”   \nIn re Schering Plough Corp. Intron/Temodar Consumer Class Action, 678 F.3d 235, 243 (3d Cir. 2012); see also  In re Horizon Healthcare Servs. Inc. Data Breach Litig., 846 F.3d 625, 632- 33 \n(3d Cir. 2017).  S uch an attack focuses on the face of the complaint, assert ing that “it is \ninsufficient to invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the court ” because there is a \n“jurisdictional defect.”  Const. Party of P a. v. Aichele, 757 F.3d 347, 358 (3d Cir. 2014).  Here, \nDefendants argue that Bryant’s Establishment Clause claim is jurisdictionally defective because \nher alleged injuries do not give her a  “concrete stake” in the litigation.  Freedom from Religion \nFound. Inc. v. New Kensington Arnold Sch. Dist ., 832 F.3d 469, 476 (3d Cir. 2016); see also \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , 594 U.S. 413, 423- 24 (2021) (explaining that “ federal courts do not \nadjudicate hypot hetical or abstract disputes ,” only suits where the plaintiff demonstrates “their \npersonal stake” in the resolution of an issue).  \nIn evaluating a facial attack, “the same standard of review ” as a motion to dismiss for \nfailure to state a claim  is applied .  Finkelman , 810 F.3d at 194.  In other words, the  “well -pleaded \nfactual allegations” in the complaint  are presumed to be true , “conclusory statements” are \n \nargument, that Bryant fails to allege an Article III injury, concerns the heart of subject matter jurisdiction —“the \ncategory of litigants empowered to maintain a lawsuit in federal court to seek redress for a legal wrong.”  Spokeo, \nInc. v. Robins , 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016).  Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 4 of 245 \n ignored, and then a determination is made as to whether the allegations  “plausibly” establish \nstanding.  Id.  (citing  In re Schering, 678 F.3d at 243).   \nIn the 12(b)(1) context, the burden of establishing the elements of standing  is on the \nplaintiff , and “ each element must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the \nplaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e. , with the manner and degree of evidence required at the \nsuccessive stages of the litigation.”  FOCUS v. Allegheny Cnty. Ct. of Common Pleas , 75 F.3d \n834, 838 (3d Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). \nii. Establishment Clause  \n“Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  They possess only that power \nauthorized by Constitution and statute  . . . .”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 \nU.S. 375, 377 (1994) (citations omitted) .  Under Article III of the Constitution, federal courts \nmay only resolve “cases” and “controversies.”  TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 423.  “ For there to be a \ncase or controversy under Article III, the plaintiff must have a personal stake in the case —in \nother words, standing.”  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  To establish \nstanding, “ a plaintiff must show (i) that [s]he suffered an injury in fact that is concrete, \nparticularized, and actual or imminent; (ii) that the injury was likely caused by the defendant; \nand (iii) that the injury would likely be redressed by judicial relief.”  Id. (citation omitted).  \n“[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross,” but rather “a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each \nclaim [s]he seeks . . . .”  Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., Inc., 581 U.S. 433, 439 (2017) (citations \nomitted).  \nDefendants argue that , with respect to her Establishment Clause claim,  Bryant fails to \nmeet the first element of standing, the injury -in-fact requirement.  Citing Freedom from Religion \nFoundation Inc. v. New Kensington Arnold School District , they contend that standing “in this Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 5 of 246 \n context” turns on whether a plaintiff alleges “direct and unwelcome personal contact with the \nalleged establishment of religion.”  832 F.3d at 476- 77 (citations omitted).  Noting that Bryant \nalleges only that she received secondhand information from her son about his engagement with his teacher about Islam, Defendants argue she has not established the essential component of \n“direct” contact with the establishment of religion.  \nTheir argument might have merit if Freedom from Religion Foundation supplied the \ncontrolling standard, but it does not.  The Third Circuit made clear that Freedom from Religion Foundation’s test applies in a different “context” —to challenges of religious displays under the \nEstablishment Clause.  Id.  at 476 (“ We first address what a plaintiff must show to have standing \nto challenge a religious display under the Establishment Clause and then examine whether standing exists  . . . .”).  By contrast, Bryant’s al legations are about allegedly coercive religious \ninstruction given to her son.  \nThus, the question really at issue here  is whether Bryant suffered a cognizable injury \nattributable to the religious teaching provided to her son.  See Fleischfresser v. Dirs. of Sch. Dis. 200, 15 F.3d 680, 683 (7th Cir. 1994) (observing that where “parents, not the students by their parents,” have brought an Establishment Clause challenge to allegedly unconstitutional religious instruction, a court “must be sure that the parents are raising rights personal to them and not the rights of their children”).  \nThe Supreme Court has long recognized that parents have an interest in their children’s \nreligious education and therefore have standing in their own right to challenge actions of their children’s school  that interfere with that interest .  See, e.g., Sch. Dist. of Abington Twp. v. \nSchempp, 374 U.S. 203, 224 n.9 (1963); Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 309 n.4 (1952); Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Bd. of Educ., 333 U.S. 203, 206 (1948); see also Donovan ex rel. Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 6 of 247 \n Donovan v. Punxsutawney Area Sch. Bd., 336 F.3d 211, 217 n.2 (3d Cir. 2003) (“ We do note \nthat parents independently have standing to bring constitutional challenges to the conditions in \ntheir children ’s schools. ”).  In Schempp, the Supreme Court considered an Establishment Clause \nchallenge to a state statute requiring school prayer.  Schempp, 374 U.S. at 205.  The Schempp family —husband, wife, and two of their children —brought suit to enjoin the statute’s \nenforcement.  Id.   Quite obviously, the Schempp parents were not themselves subject ed to the \nschool prayer requirement.  See id.  at 206- 08.  While this might have suggested that they lacked \nstanding to sue in their own right, the  Supreme  Court wrote:  \nIt goes without saying that the laws and practices involved here can be challenged only \nby persons having standing to complain. . . . The parties here are school children and their parents, who are directly affected by the laws and practices against which their complaints are directed. These interests surely suffice to give the parties standing to complain. \nId. at 224 n.9 (citation omitted).  As later clarified in Valley Forge Christian College v. \nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., the Schempp plaintiffs had standing \n“because impressionable schoolchildren were subjected to unwelcome religious exercises or \nwere forced to assume special burdens to avoid them.”  454 U.S. 464, 486 n.22 (1982).   \nIn light of Schempp , courts have held that where parents are “directly affected” by \nreligious practices at their children’s school, the parents independently “have standing to raise their claim alleging a violation of the Establishment Clause because the impermissible establishment of religion might inhibit their right to direct the religious training of their children.”  Fleischfresser , 15 F.3d at 684; accord  Grove v. Mead Sch. Dist. No. 354, 753 F.2d \n1528, 1532 (9th Cir. 1985), cert. denied , 474 U.S. 826 (1985); Dobrich v. Walls , 380 F. Supp.2d \n366, 372- 73 (D. Del. 2005) . \nTurning to this case, Bryant alleges that the unconsented religious instruction caused \ndisputes about religion between her and her son.  She now seeks damages for this alleged Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 7 of 248 \n interference with her religious training of her son, whom she notes is particularly vulnerable \nbecause of his disability.  Accepting these allegations as true, they are sufficient for standing.  See, e.g., Dobrich, 380 F. Supp.2d at 370- 73 (concluding that parents had standing to seek \ndamages after a dispute about school -sponsored prayer and religious “privileges” triggered \npublic harassment and forced some family members to relocate); Separation of Hinduism from our Schs . v. Chi . Pub. Schs., 2021 WL 2036536, at *7 (N.D. Ill. May 21, 2021) (determining that \nparent had standing where he alleged he was “angered by the intrusion into his child’ s religious \neducation and coercion toward a belief system that he believed was inconsistent with Christianity ” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Doe v. Heritage Acad., Inc., 2017 WL \n6001481, at *5- 6 (D. Az. June 9, 2017) (concluding that a father had standing to challenge \n“unwanted religious instruction”  at his son’s public charter school because he alleged it \nundermine d “his responsibility . . . to provide for his child or children’s religious education” ).  \nAccordingly, Defendants’ motion will be denied to the extent it is premised on lack of standing.  \nB. 12(b)(6)  \nTurning to Defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) contentions, they argue that the Amended \nComplaint , with its dearth of facts, fails to state a ny claim.  In addition, Lucas argues she is \nentitled to qualified immunity  with respect to any claims brought against her in her personal \ncapacity .  Because the qualified immunity analysis turns in part on whether she adequately states \nher claim s, the sufficiency of Bryant’s allegations will be considered first. \ni. Legal Standard  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 8 of 249 \n U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content \nthat allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by \nmere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id.   When analyzing a motion to dismiss, a  \ncomplaint must be construed “in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,” with the question being “whether, under any reasonable re ading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to \nrelief.”  Fowler , 578 F.3d at 210 (citation omitted).  Legal conclusions are disregarded, well -\npleaded facts are taken as true, and a determination is made as to whether those facts state a “plausible claim for relief.”  Id.  at 210- 11 (citation omitted).   \nBecause Bryant  is proceeding pro se , her allegations must be construed liberally at this \nstage.  See Vogt v. Wetzel , 8 F.4th 182, 185 (3d Cir. 2021) (citing Mala , 704 F.3d at  244- 45).  \nThe “relevant legal principle” therefore will be applied “even when the complaint has failed to name it.”  Id.   “[E]ven if it is vague, repetitious, or contains extraneous information, a pro se \ncomplaint’s language will ordinarily be ‘plain’” in satisfaction of Rule 8 “if it presents cognizable legal claims to which a defendant can respond on the merits.”  Garrett v. Wexford \nHealth , 938 F.3d 69, 94 (3d Cir. 2019) (citations omitted). \nii. Constitutional Claims  Pursuant to  § 1983  \nBryant’s claims alleging violations of the Establishment Clause and her Fourteenth \nAmendment rights  are governed by § 1983, the statutory vehicle by which federal constitutional \nclaims may be heard in federal court.  Section 1983 provides in part:  \nEvery person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of \nany State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction ther eof to the \ndeprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.  Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 9 of 2410 \n 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  “To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right \nsecured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.”  West v. Atkins , 487 U.S. \n42, 48 (1988). \na. Establishment Clause  \nBryant ’s Establishment Clause claim is premised on her contention that the School \nDistrict violated her Establishment Clause rights by allowing a teacher to proselytize to her son.  \nThe Establishment Clause, applied to the States and their political subdivisions through \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, provides that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.”  U.S. Const. amend. I; Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 49-50 (1985).  To prevail on an Establishment Clause claim, a plaintiff must show that the challenged government action “resemble[s] a traditional hallmark of religious establishment.”  See Hilsenrath ex rel. C.H. v. Sch. Dist. of Chathams , 136 F.4th 484, 486 (3d Cir. 2025), petition for \ncert. filed , No. 25-256 (Sept. 4, 2025).  The Third Circuit has identified  six such hallmarks : \nFirst, the government exerted control over the doctrine and personnel of the established \nchurch.  Second, the government mandated attendance in the established church and punished people for failing to participate.  Third, the government punished dissenting churches and individuals for their religious exercise.  Fourth, the government restricted political participation by dissenters.  Fifth, the government provided financial support for the established church, often in a way that preferred the established denomination over other churches.  And sixth, the government used the established church to carry out certain civil functions, often by giving the established church a monopoly over a specific function. \nId. at 491 ( citing  Shurtleff v. City of Boston , 596 U.S. 243, 286 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in \nthe judgment)).  Courts are to draw comparisons between these hallmarks and the challenged \ngovernment conduct.  Id.\n6 \n \n6 Judge Phipps note s that  there are two outstanding questions regarding Hilsenrath ’s hallmark s test: “ (i) whether \n Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 10 of 2411 \n  The second Hilsenrath hallmark —“the government mandat[ing] attendance in the \nestablished church and punish[ing] people for failing to participate” —reflects that the \nEstablishment Clause prohibits the government, including public schools, from coercing \nindividuals into religious  practice.  Id. at 491- 92.  Indeed, “ coercion was one of the one of the \n‘foremost hallmarks of religious establishments’ at the founding . . . .”  Id. at 492 (quoting Kennedy  v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, 537 (2022) ).  The “government may not, \nconsistent with a historically sensitive understanding of the Establishment Clause, ‘make a religious observance compulsory.’”  Kennedy, 597 U.S. at 537 (quoting Zorach, 343 U.S. at 314).  “[N]or may it force citizens to engage in ‘ a formal religious exercise.’”  Id.  (quoting Lee v. \nWeisman , 505 U.S. 577, 589 (1992)).  So, for instance, a public school violates the Establishment \nClause by permitting a student to deliver a prayer over a public address system before each varsity football game because of the prayer’s coercive effect on spectators .  See Santa Fe Indep. \nSch. Dist. v. Doe , 530 U.S. 290, 311- 12 (2000) ; see also Lee, 505 U.S. at 593 (holding \nunconstitutional a religious benediction given at a high school graduation ceremony because of “heightened concerns with protecting freedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in the  \nelementary and secondary public schools ”).\n \nIn assessing a  motion to dismiss  an Establishment Clause claim , a court’s role is to \nidentify a standard— adduced from factually similar Establishment Clause  cases —and  ask \nwhether a complaint’s well -pleaded allegations  state a facially plausible claim.  See, e.g., \nFreedom from Religion Found., Inc. v. New Kensington- Arnold Sch. Dist., 919 F. Supp.2d 648, \n \ngovernmental action that offends only one of the hallmarks is sufficient for an Establishment Clause violation, or \nwhether the hallmarks should be considered in the aggregate; and (ii) if one or more of the hallmarks of an \nestablished church are present, w hether that is dispositive  of an Establishment Clause violation, or whether the \ngovernment can justify its offending practice as comporting with history and tradition. ”  Id. at 494 -95 (Phipps, J., \nconcurring in the judgment).  These questions need not be addressed here because, as discussed below,  Bryant’s \nallegations do not plausibly state a claim under any  of the Hilsenrath  hallmark s. Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 11 of 2412 \n 652-61 (W.D. Pa. 2013); Tearpock -Martini  v. Borough, 98 F. Supp.3d 697, 700- 02 (M.D. Pa. \n2015); Fields  v. Speaker of the Pa. House of Representatives , 251 F. Supp.3d 772, 789- 91 (M.D. \nPa. 2017). \nHere, Bryant alleges that her son’s public school coerced him into Islam.  In Hilsenrath , a \ncase also involving allegations of Islamic proselytization at a public school, the Third Circuit  \nconsidered a parent’s Establishment Clause challenge to curriculum in her son’s  mandatory \n“Word Cultures and Geography” class.  Hilsenrath , 136 F.4th at 486- 87.  The curriculum \nassigned videos that, in addition to covering the five pillars of Islam, contained messages \ndescribing Allah as “the one God” and Islam as “the tr ue faith.”  Id.  at 487- 88.  The parent \nalleged that the school board “did something like mandat[ing] attendance in the established church” by requiring her to son to watch  these videos.   Id. at 491 (alteration in original) (internal \nquotation marks  omitted ).   \nAddressing her argument, the court distinguished “permissible curricular materials from \nimpermissible proselytization.”  Id.  at 493.  On the unconstitutional  side of the  line are instances \nwhere a public school opens its doors to clergy -led religious instruction during school hours, see \nMcCollum , 333 U.S. at 206- 09, or organizes  an orthodox devotional practice , such  as student \nreading s from the  Bible and recitation s of the Lord’s Prayer at the start of the school day, see \nSchempp, 374 U.S. at 207, 223.  On the  constitutional  side of the line are instances where \nstudents encounter  religious material  for legitimate “academic ” purposes.  Hilsenrath , 136 F.4th \nat 492.  The videos in Hilsenrath fell on this side of the line.   They  were instructional, not \ncoercive, because t he school board had assigned the m to help students “ explore the 5 Pillars of \nFaith and be able to explain the impact/significance of them in the Muslim culture ,” as well as  to \nlearn  the benefits and consequences of generalizations.  Id. at 493.  Moreover , the unit on Islam Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 12 of 2413 \n was part of the class’s larger exploration of world history and culture, which included \nintroductions to several other faiths, including Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism.  Id.  The court therefore  authorized public school curriculum incorporating ostensibly religious \ndoctrine into “an appropriate study of history, civilization, and comparative religion.”  Id. at 493 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   The court affirmed that “[w]hile there may be \ncircumstances in which public schools violate the Establishment Clause by subjecting students to proselytizing materials,” it also “cautioned against ‘ [f]ocus[ing] exclusively on the religious \ncomponent of any activity.’”  Id. at 492 (second and third alteration s in original) (citing Lynch  v. \nDonnelly , 465 U.S. 668, 680 (1984)). \nThe facts that Bryant provides in support of her Establishment Clause claim are spare, \ni.e., one of her son’s teachers gave him Islamic teaching and religious items , and  the District \ndoes not offer an Islamic studies  class .  Nothing is known beyond that.  Indeed, there is not even \nan allegation that the complained -of interaction  occurred  at school.  Apart from the conclusory \naccusation that the teachings were “forced” on her son, Bryant provides no plausible facts from \nwhich it could be concluded that the District sanctioned the proselytization of her son.  Accordingly, her Establishment Clause claim against the District will be dismissed  without \nprejudice. \nb. Equal Protection Clause  \nBryant’s second constitutional claim, also brought pursuant to § 1983, arises under the \nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe Equal Protection Clause commands: “No State shall . . . deny to any person within its \njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV.  A plaintiff can state a n \nequal protection claim under either a protected classification or “class of one” theory.  See Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 13 of 2414 \n Echevarria v. Cnty. of Bergen, 2025 WL 517955, at *9 (D.N.J. Feb. 18, 2025) (citing Vill. of \nWillowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 563 (2000)).  Under a protected  classification theory, a \nplaintiff must allege “[s]he was treated differently than other similarly situated [individuals], and that this different treatment was the result of intentional discrimination based on [her] membership in a protected class.”   Mack v. Warden Loretto FCI , 839 F.3d 286, 305 (3d Cir. \n2016) (citing Hassan v. City of N.Y., 804 F.3d 277, 294, 298 (3d Cir. 2015)) .  To state a claim \nunder a “class of one” theory, “ a plaintiff must allege that (1) the defendant treated [her] \ndifferently from others similarly situated, (2) the defendant did so intentionally, and (3) there was no rational basis for the difference in treatment .”  Hill v. Borough of Kutztown, 455 F.3d 225, \n239 (3d Cir. 2006).   \nCommon to both theories is the requirement  that a n individual  be treated differently \nrelative to “similarly situated individuals.”   At the pleadings stage, this is not a demanding \nrequirement.  A plaintiff need not “name names” or identify “specific instances where others \nhave been treated differently.”  Phillips v. Cnty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 244- 45 (3d Cir. \n2008) (citing DeMuria v. Hawkes , 328 F.3d 704, 707 (2d Cir. 2003)).  Rather , “[she] must allege \nfacts sufficient to make plausible the existence of . . . similarly situated parties ,” Perano v. Twp. \nof Tilden , 423 Fed. App’x 234, 238 (3d Cir. 2011), who are “alike ‘in all relevant aspects’” to \nher, Startzell v. City of Phila. , 533 F.3d 183, 203 (3d Cir. 2008) (quoting Nordlinger v. Hahn, \n505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992)).  “ [T]he failure to identify similarly situated persons dooms an equal -\nprotection claim.”  Stradford v. Sec ’y Pa. Dep’ t of Corrs ., 53 F.4th 67, 74 (3d Cir. 2022)  (citing \nHill, 455 F.3d at 239) . \nBryant has failed to meet this low burden.  She alleges that Lucas  “targeted” her  and, \nmore broadly, engaged in a conspiracy with other staff members to defame her and suppress her Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 14 of 2415 \n ability to be an active parent within the District.  But “[s]he does not allege the existence of \nsimilarly situated individuals ,” and she does not allege  they were treated differently than her.  \nHill, 455 F.3d at 239 (citation omitted) .  For this reason alone , her claim must fail.  See id.  \n(granting a motion to dismiss because the complaint did not allege that a mayor treated other borough employees differently) ; Akil v. City of Phila. , 2023 WL 8548743, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Dec. \n11, 2023) (dismissing an e qual protection claim where the complaint  did not identify any \ncomparators) . \nDefendants also argue that h er claim under a protected classification theory require s \ndismissal  for an additional  reason .  Alleging “intentional discrimination” under that theory \nrequires  facts indicating a “state actor meant to single out a plaintiff because of the protected \ncharacteristic itself.”  Hassan , 804 F.3d at 297 (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).   \nBryant , however, does not allege  a protected characteristic.  A liberal reading of the Amended \nComplaint suggests she believes that being the parent of a disabled child qualifies as a protected \ncharacteristic.  But the Equal Protection Clause does not provide heightened protections to individuals with disabilities, let alone to parents of such individuals.  See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 442- 47 (1985) (holding that persons with disabilities are not \na suspect classification for the purposes of an equal protection challenge).  The closest Br yant \ngets to alleging a protected characteristic is her statement that she suffers “from anxiety of known police brutality against people of color .”  She, however, does not identify her race in the \nAmended Complaint .  Nor does she allege that any discrimination she faced from the District \nwas because of her race.\n7  Accordingly, her  equal p rotection claim against the District will be \n \n7 In her response in opposition, Bryant states the District “targeted Bryant due to her race.”   Her contention, \nhowever, cannot be considered because “ courts generally consider only the allegations contained in the complaint, \nexhibits attached to the complaint and matters of public record” in deciding a motion to dismiss.  Pension Benefit \n Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 15 of 2416 \n dismissed  without prejudice. \nc. Due Process  Clause  \nBryant ’s due process claim pursuant to § 1983 will, however, not be dismissed.  The Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides : “No State shall . . . deprive any person \nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”  U.S. Const. amend. XIV.  \nAs an initial matter, Defendants fault Bryant for not expressly invoking the Due Process \nClause in her complaint.  She complains only of her “civil rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.”  While Rule 8 does require “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2),  it “do[es]  not countenance dismissal of a \ncomplaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted ,” Johnson v. \nCity of Shelby , 574 U.S. 10, 11 (2014) (per curiam) (citations omitted), particularly when th e \nplaintiff is representing herself.  Indeed, in Johnson, where the lower court had dismissed a Fourteenth Amendment due process claim against a municipality because the complaint failed to mention it was brought pursuant to § 1983, the Supreme Court reversed .  Id. at 11.  Likewise, it \nwould be inappropriate to grant dismissal here just because Bryant, proceeding pro se , did not \ninvoke the magic words of “due process.” \nTurning now to the allegations that underpin her due process claim, Bryant says that the \nDistrict, by way of one of Lucas’ subordinates, filed a false police report against her .  Separately, \nshe says that Lucas and other district employees perjured themselves at an IDEA “due process” hearing. \nDefendants do not meaningfully engage with these allegations.  Instead, they make \nconclusory assertions that these “violations” are “speculative” and that Bryant “does not allege a \n \nGuar. Corp. v. White Consol. Indus., Inc. , 998 F.2d 1192, 1196 (3d Cir. 1993) (citations omitted).   Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 16 of 2417 \n deprivation of procedural rights, which would require an allegation that (1) she was deprived of \nan individual interest ‘encompassed within the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of life, liberty, or property; and (2) the procedures available to [her] did not provide due process of law.’”  Defs.’ Br. 8 (quoting Battle v. Marchese, 2025 WL 1710538, at * 18 (M.D. Pa. May 27, 2025)).  Merely repeating keywords from Twombly and stating the due process standard, coupled with a bare assertion that it is unmet, doe s not satisfy Defendants’ burden of showing the \nAmended Complaint fails to state a claim.\n 8  Hedges v. United States , 404 F.3d 744, 750 (3d Cir. \n2005) (“ The defendant bears the burden of showing that no claim has been presented. ” (citing  \nKehr Packages, Inc. v. Fidelcor, Inc., 926 F.2d 1406, 1409 (3d Cir. 1991) )); see, e.g., Doe v. \nWozniak , 2009 WL 10715510, at *9 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 3, 2009) (concluding defendants failed to \nmeet their burden when their argument was simply: “Plaintiff has failed to make any allegations of a conspiracy or agreement to act to deprive her of her civil rights.  Therefore, Plaintiff ’s claim \nfor conspiracy pursuant to § 1983 must be dismissed.” ).  Accordingly, Defendants’ Motion to \nDismiss Bryant’s due process claim against the District will be denied . \niii. Perjury Claims  \nTurning now to Bryant’s perjury claims stemming from her allegations that Lucas and \nother district employees lied “ under oath”  at her son’s IDEA hearing:  she does not specify \nwhether they  arise under federal or state law, so they  will be analyzed under both the federal \ncriminal perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1621(1), and Pennsylvania criminal perjury statute, 18 Pa. C.S.A.  § 4902(a).  \n \n8 In a similar vein, Defendants state, without argument, that Bryant’s due process and equal protection claims should \nbe dismissed because Bryant  “has failed to allege a state- created danger theory or a theory of municipality liability \nsupported by Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services , 436 U.S. 658 (1978) and its progeny.”  Absent \nadvocacy to support a position, the Court has not been provided with the tools to make a decision on this point and, \nthus, Bryant’s due process and equal protection claims will not be dismissed on this argument.  Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 17 of 2420 \n participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this part . \n34 C.F.R. § 100.7(e).10   \n Bryant’s claim is premised on her allegations that the District retaliated against her for \nenforcing her son’s § 504 rights: specifically, that the District retaliated by filing a false police \nreport.  Defendants did not address Bryant’s retaliation claim in their brief and, accordingly, it will not be dismissed against the District.   See Hedges , 404 F.3d at 750 (“ The defendant bears \nthe burden of showing that no claim has been presented.” (citing Kehr , 926 F.2d at 1409)).  \nv. Qualified Immunity  \nTo the extent she is sued in her personal capacity, Lucas argues that she has qualified \nimmunity as a government official .\n11  Qualified immunity “ balances two important interests —\nthe need to hold public officials accountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment, distraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably .”  Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009) .  It “protects government officials \n‘from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established \nstatutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’”  Id. (quoting \nHarlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)).  A two-part framework is used to evaluate \nwhether a defendant is protected by the qualified immunity doctrine : (1) whether the facts as \nalleged constitute a violation of a constitutio nal or statutory right, and (2) whether the right at \nissue was “ clearly established ” at the time of the alleged misconduct.  See id. at 231- 32.  A \ngovernment official bears both the burden of pleading the defense, Thomas v. Indep. Twp., 463 \n \n10 34 C.F.R. § 1007(e) is the “ anti-retaliation regulation implementing section 504 .”  Lauren W. ex rel. Jean W. v. \nDeFlaminis , 480 F.3d 259, 266 n.5 (3d Cir. 2007) . \n11 Although Lucas appears to raise the defense to all claims again st her , qualified immunity is a defense to federal \nclaims only.  See El v. City of Pittsburgh , 975 F.3d 327, 334 n.3 (3d Cir. 2020).  Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 20 of 2421 \n F.3d 285, 293 (3d Cir. 2006), and the burden of persuasion, see Burns v. Pa. Dep’t of Corrs., 642 \nF.3d 163, 176 (3d Cir. 2011) (“ The burden of establishing qualified immunity falls to the official \nclaiming it as a defense. ” (citing Harlow , 457 U.S. at 819)) ; see also Reedy v. Evanson, 615 F.3d \n197, 223 (3d Cir. 2010) (“The burden of establishing entitlement to qualified immunity is on [the defendant].” (citing Harlow , 457 U.S. at 808)).  \na. Establishment Clause and Equal Protection Clause Claims  \nWith respect to Bryant’s § 1983 claims premised on the Establishment and Equal \nProtection Clauses, Lucas has qualified immunity.  Under prong one of the qualified immunity framework, a  well -pleaded complaint “necessarily alleges a constitutional violation for purposes \nof qualified immunity, while a complaint that fails to plausibly plead the violation of a right does not.”  Stringer v. Cnty. of Bucks , 141 F.4th 76, 85 (3d Cir. 2025).  Accordingly, because the \nAmended Complaint does not plead a plausible violation of Bryant’s Establishment Clause  and \nequal protection rights, Lucas is entitled to qualified immunity on those claims as currently pleaded.  See A.W., 486 F.3d at 806; George v. Rehiel , 738 F.3d 562, 579 (3d Cir. 2013) \n(granting qualified immunity after concluding the complaint did not establish a First Amendment retaliation claim).  \nb. Due Process Clause and § 504 Retaliation Claims \nLucas also argues she has qualified immunity as to Bryant’s due process and § 504 \nretaliation claims.  As a threshold issue, the Court notes that Third Circuit has recognized qualified immunity applies to individual- capacity claims under federal statutes, including the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.  See Mack v. Yost , 63 F.4th 211, 224 (3d Cir. 2023); see also Lue v. \nMoore , 43 F.3d 1203, 1205 (8th Cir. 1994) (“Four other courts of appeals . . .  have applied the \nqualified immunity defense in lawsuits filed under the Rehabilitation Act.  We think this result is Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 21 of 2422 \n sensible.   The broad language of Harlow v. Fitzgerald . . . suggests qualified immunity should \nnormally be available in civil damages lawsuits unless Congress has stated otherwise .” (citations \nomitted)).  \nAs explained above, Defendants have not shown that the Amended Complaint fails to \nstate a due process  or § 504 retaliation claim.  By that same logic, Lucas has not met her burden \nof establishing she is entitled to qualified immunity on these claim s, at least under prong one of \nthe analysis.  \nThat means the success of Lucas’ defense turns on the second prong—whether the rights \nwere “clearly established” at the time of the alleged violations.  Lucas, in essence, argues she is \nentitled to immunity because “ the complaint does not contain any factual allegations that would \nnegate [her] qualified immunity defense. ”  Thomas , 463 F.3d at 291.  Specifically, she argues: \n“On the face of Plaintiff’s complaint, it is not clear which constitutional or statutory right Lucas is alleged to have violated, nor has Plaintiff made sufficient allegations that Lucas understood \nthat her actions violated that right such to remove the shield of qualified immunity.”  Lucas’ argument is “legally unsound,” id., and squarely foreclosed by Third Circuit precedent.   \nTo reiterate, “the ‘ burden of pleading a qualified immunity defense,’  like any other \naffirmative defense, ‘ rests with the defendant.’”  Stringer , 141 F.4th at 86 (quoting Thomas , 463 \nF.3d at 293).   Lucas’ argument flips the qualified immunity burden.  Qualified immunity is not, \nas Lucas characterizes it, a “shield” that Bryant must “remove” by pleading a violation of clearly law established law.  Nor is “qualified immunity” a “ a talismanic phrase that relieves Defendants \nof their burden to show that their actions did not violat e . . . clearly established constitutional [or \nstatutory]  rights.”  Jennings v. Borst , 2019 WL 4447593, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 16, 2019) .  As \nrecently reaffirmed by the Third Circuit,  “a plaintiff ‘ has no pleading burden to anticipate or Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 22 of 2423 \n overcome a qualified immunity defense.’”  Stringer , 141 F.4th at 86 (quoting Thomas , 463 F.3d \nat 289). \n Quite apart from Lucas’ incorrect understanding of the burden in a qualified immunity \ndefense, Lucas’ argument for qualified immunity as to Bryant’s due process and § 504 claims is “conclusory and undeveloped.”  Id.   She neither defines the rights  allegedly violated  nor \ndemonstrates that they were clearly established.   Accordingly, her request for qualified immunity \nas to these claims will be denied.  \nIf appropriate, Lucas may raise this defense again at summary judgment, when she will \nstill have the burden of establishing immunity.  See Yost , 63 F.4th at 227 (“‘ [T]he party asserting \nthe affirmative defense of qualified immunity ’ bears the burden of persuasion on both prongs at \nsummary judgment.” (quoting Halsey v. Pfeiffer , 750 F.3d 273, 288 (3d Cir. 2014)).  \nvi. State Law Tort Claims  \nFinally, the School District move s to dismiss Bryant’s  claims for defamation, intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress, and false light—e ach of which are brought  under Pennsylvania \nlaw—on the grounds that they are barred by the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims \nAct (“PSTCA”), 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 8541 et seq .\n12  The PSTCA declares that “ no local agency shall \nbe liable for any damages on account of any injury to a person or property caused by any act of the local agency or an employee thereof or any other person.”  Id.  Although the re is an \nexception for negligent acts involving nine enumerated categories,\n13 the PSTCA  completely bars \n \n12 Defendants moved to dismiss these claims against Lucas in her official capacity only.  Thus, these  claims remain \nagainst her in a personal capacity.  \n13 The enumerated exceptions include : (1) vehicle liability; (2) care, custody, or control of personal property; (3) real \nproperty; (4) trees, traffic controls, and street lighting; (5) utility service facilities; (6) dangerous conditions of \nstreets; (7) dangerous conditions of sidewalks; (8) care, custody, or control of animals; and,  (9) sexual abuse .  Id. § \n8542(b) .  Case 2:25-cv-03140-WB     Document 23     Filed 09/19/25     Page 23 of 2424 \n liability for intentional torts.  See id. § 8542(b) ; see also West  ex rel. S.W.  v. Pittsburgh Pub. \nSchs., 327 A.3d 340, 346 (Pa. Commw . 2024) (“[T he law is settled that . . . liability may be \nimposed on a local agency only for negligent acts. ”).  A s chool district is a “local agency” for \npurposes of the PSTCA.  See West  ex rel. S.W. , 327 A.3d at 346.  Accordingly, Bryant’s claims \nagainst the District for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and false light \nshall be dismissed with prejudice.  \nAn appropriate Order follows. \nBY THE COURT:  \n \n       __/s/ Wendy Beetlestone__________ \nWENDY BEETLESTONE, C.

Case 5:22-cv-00268-TES     Document 47     Filed 07/18/23     Page 1 of 14shall be designated CONFIDENTIAL or CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY prior \nto, or contemporaneously with, the production or disclosure of the documents. If timely corrected, \nan inadvertent failure to designate qualified information or items as CONFIDENTIAL or \nCONFIDENTIAL-ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY does not, standing alone, waive the Designating \nParty's right to secure protection under this Order for such material. Upon timely correction of a \ndesignation, the Receiving Party must make reasonable efforts to assure that the material is treated \nin accordance with the provisions of this Order. The Receiving Party shall not be responsible for \nany use or dissemination of such document which occuned prior to such correction but shall take \nall reasonable steps necessary to retrieve any and all copies of such document or materials and \ninform any individuals to whom the documents or materials were disclosed that they were disclosed \nin error and are subject to the provisions of this Order. \n3. Documents Which May be Designated. \na. Documents Which May be Designated Confidential. Any party or non-party may \ndesignate documents as CONFIDENTIAL but only after review of the documents \nby an attorney who has, in good faith, determined that the documents contain \ninformation protected from disclosure by statute, sensitive personal information, \ntrade secrets, or confidential research, development, or commercial information. The \ncertification shall be made concurrently with the disclosure of the documents, using \nthe form attached hereto at Attachment A which shall be executed subject to the \nstandards of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Information or \ndocuments which are available in the public sector may not be designated as \nconfidential. \n2 Case 5:22-cv-00268-TES     Document 47     Filed 07/18/23     Page 2 of 14b. Documents Which May be Designated Confidential Attorneys' Eyes Only. \nCONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY classification, being more \nhighly protective of disclosure than the \"CONFIDENTIAL\" classification, governs \ninformation that an attorney, in good faith, determines would materially damage or \nadversely impact the business, financial, or commercial interests of the party, non­\nparty, or person producing such material if such information is disclosed to another \nparty or non-party. The certification shall be made concurrently with the disclosure \nof the documents, using the form attached hereto at Attachment D which shall be \nexecuted subject to the standards of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \nInformation or documents which are available in the public sector may not be \ndesignated as confidential. Materials entitled to protection under CONFIDENTIAL \n-ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY designation may include, but are not limited to, \nconfidential research and development, financial, technical, marketing, sensitive \ntrade secret information, proprietary procedures, customer lists that have not been \npublished on the disclosing party's or non-party's website or otherwise publicly \ndisclosed, confidential information about the disclosing party's/non-party's \ncustomers or employees, and documents that identify principals, customers, or \nsuppliers of the producing party, non-party, or person that have not been published \non the disclosing party's/non-party's website or otherwise publicly disclosed. \nInformation or documents that are available in the public sector, which do not meet \nthe description of CONFIDENTIAL, or which have been previously available to a \nrequesting party or which were authored by, intended for, or received by a requesting \n3 Case 5:22-cv-00268-TES     Document 47     Filed 07/18/23     Page 3 of 14party/non-party may not be designated as CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' \nEYES ONLY. \nc, Documents Which May Be Designated CONFIDENTIAL- ATTORNEYS' \nEYES ONLY CLASS INFORMATION. If the Court certifies a class, Defendant \nmay designate documents CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY­\nCLASS INFORMATION based on a determination through review by an attorney \nor artificial intelligence that the document contains the information regarding class \nmembers, including their names, business names, emails, or phone numbers. \nPlaintiffs' counsel must treat documents designated CONFIDENTIAL . \nATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY-CLASS INFORMATION consistent with documents \ndesignated CONFIDENTIAL-ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY. \ni. Information or documents which are available in the public sector may not \nbe designated as confidential. \n4. Depositions. Portions of depositions shall be deemed confidential only if designated \nas such when the deposition is taken, within twenty business days after receipt of the transcript, or \nas soon as reasonably practicable before the close of discovery, whichever is shorter. Such \ndesignation shall be specific as to the portions to be protected. If timely corrected, an inadvertent \nfailure to designate qualified information or items does not, standing alone, waive the Designating \nParty's right to secure protection under this Order for such material. Upon timely correction of a \ndesignation, the Receiving Party must make reasonable efforts to assure that the material is treated \nin accordance with the provisions of this Order. The Receiving Party shall not be responsible for \nany use or dissemination of such document which occurred prior to such conection. \n4 Case 5:22-cv-00268-TES     Document 47     Filed 07/18/23     Page 4 of 145, Protection of Confidential Material. \na.

Counsel shall \nretain the certification together with the form signed by the party, non-party or employee. \n6 Case 5:22-cv-00268-TES     Document 47     Filed 07/18/23     Page 6 of 14d, Copies. All copies, duplicates, extracts, summaries, or descriptions (hereinafter \nreferred to collectively as \"copies\"), of documents or any portion of a document \ndesignated under this Order shall be immediately affixed with the designation \n\"CONFIDENTIAL\" or \"CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\" if the \nwords do not already appear on the copy. All such copies shall be afforded the full \nprotection of this Order. \n6. Filing of Confidential or Confidential Attorneys' Eyes Only Materials. In the \nevent a party or non-party seeks to file any material that is subject to protection under this Order \nwith the Court, that party or non-party shall take appropriate action to insure that the documents \nreceive proper protection from public disclosure including: (I) filing a redacted document with the \nconsent of the paity who designated the document as confidential; (2) where appropriate ( e.g. in \nrelation to discovery and evidentiary motions), submitting the documents solely for in camera \nreview; or (3) where the preceding measures are not adequate, seeking permission to file the \ndocument under seal. Nothing in this Order shall be construed as a prior directive to the Clerk of \nCourt to allow any document be filed under seal. The parties and non-parties understand that \ndocuments may be filed under seal only with the permission of the court. The party designating the \nmaterial as subject to protection under this order retains the burden to demonstrate that any \ndocument filed with the Court should remain (in whole or in part) under seal. \n7, Greater Protection of Specific Documents. No party or non-party may withhold \ninformation from discovery on the ground that it requires protection greater than that afforded by \nthis Order unless the party or non-party moves for an Order providing such special protection. \n7 Case 5:22-cv-00268-TES     Document 47     Filed 07/18/23     Page 7 of 148, Challenges to Designation as Confidential or Confidential Attorneys' Eyes \nOnly, Any CONFIDENTIAL or CONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY designation \nis subject to challenge. The following procedures shall apply to any such challenge. \na. The burden of proving the necessity of a Confidential designation remains with the \nparty or non-party asserting confidentiality. \nb. A party or non-party who contends that documents designated CONFIDENTIAL or \nCONFIDENTIAL -ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY are not entitled to confidential \ntreatment shall give written notice to the party or non-party who affixed the \ndesignation of the specific basis for the challenge. The party or non-party who so \ndesignated the documents shall have fifteen ( 15) days from service of the written \nnotice to determine if the dispute can be resolved without judicial intervention and, \nif not, to move for an Order confirming the Confidential designation. \nc, Notwithstanding any challenge to the designation of documents as confidential, all \nmaterial previously designated CONFIDENTIAL or CONFIDENTIAL -\nATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY shall continue to be treated as subject to the full \nprotections of this Order until one of the following occurs: \ni. the party or non-patiy who claims that the documents are confidential \nwithdraws such designation in writing; \nii. the party or non-party who claims that the documents are confidential fails \nto move timely for an Order designating the documents as confidential as set \nforth in paragraph 8.b. above; or \niii. the Court rules that the documents should no longer be designated as \nconfidential information. \n8 Case 5:22-cv-00268-TES     Document 47     Filed 07/18/23     Page 8 of 14d. Challenges to the confidentiality of documents may be made at any time and are not \nwaived by the failure to raise the challenge at the time of initial disclosure or \ndesignation. \n9. Inadvertent Production of Privileged or Other Protected Material. When a \nProducing Party gives notice to Receiving Parties that certain inadvertently produced material is \nsubject to a claim of privilege or other protection, the obligations of the Receiving Parties are those \nset forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b )(5)(B). Further, no party shall be held to have \nwaived any right or legally-cognizable privilege or evidentiary protection by such inadvertent \nproduction, provided the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 502(b) are satisfied. Pursuant \nto Federal Rule of Evidence 502( d) and ( e ), insofar as the parties reach an agreement on the effect \nof disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work \nproduct protection, the parties may incorporate their agreement in the stipulated protective order \nsubmitted to the court. \n10.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The court case involves Plaintiff Robert Thackston, who alleged disability discrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment under the Rehabilitation Act after not being promoted at the Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC). The court recommended granting the Secretary of the Army’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing Thackston's claims for lack of standing, as he failed to demonstrate that any requested injunctive relief would redress his injuries. Notably, the case involved artificial intelligence, as Plaintiff’s counsel was suggested to have improperly used generative AI tools, leading to inaccurate legal citations in the submitted materials.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The primary legal issue is whether Thackston’s claims, particularly for injunctive relief, can redress his alleged injuries, thereby granting him standing to pursue the action under the Rehabilitation Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that Thackston lacked standing because he failed to propose any remedy that would appropriately redress his alleged injuries within the constraints of federal regulations, leading to the recommendation for dismissal of the case. Additionally, the court suggested that Plaintiff's counsel might face Rule 11 sanctions for inaccuracies in legal citations that appeared to result from improper use of generative AI.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** The court is saying that Thackston, the person suing, doesn't have the right (standing) to continue his lawsuit because he didn't show how what he's asking the court to do—like making the Army give him better job training or a promotion—would actually fix the problems he says he has. Also, the lawyer might be in trouble for copying information from an AI tool without checking if it's correct, like someone turning in homework with made-up answers.",

Driscoll’s \nResponse to Plaintiff’s Injunctive Relief Statement and Renewed Motion for Judgment on the \nPleadings  [#41]. All pretrial matters  in this case  have been referred to the undersigned for disposition \npursuant to Western District of Texas L ocal Rule CV -72 and Appendix C [#18]. The undersigned \nhas authority to enter this recommendation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  636(b)(1)(B).  For the reasons set \nforth  below, it is recommended that the motion  [#41] be GRANTED . The undersigned also notifies \nthe District Court that Rule 11(c) sanctions may be appropriate in this matter.  \nI.       Background  \n Plaintiff Robert Thackston has worked in the Brooke Army Medical Center Pharmacy  \n(“BAMC”)  since April 2011. (Am. Compl. [#14], ¶ 12.)  He filed this suit against the Secretary of the \nArmy, d/b/a BAMC, alleging discrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment under the \nRehabilitation Act. (Am. Compl. [#14], ¶ 5.) The Secretary previously filed a motion to dismiss \n[#15], which the undersigned recommended be granted in part and denied in part [#27]. The Court Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 1 of 162 \n adopted the Report and Recommendation on March 27, 2025 [#30]. As such, Plaintiff’s disability \ndiscrimination claims under the Rehabilitation Act based on failure -to-promote incidents in July \n2021, May 2022, and August 2022 survived the motion to dismiss; his other discrimination claims \nwere dismissed. (Order Adopting Report and Recommendation [#30], at 2.) Similarly, his \nRehabilitation Act retaliation claims based on internal complaints and failure -to-promote incidents in \nJuly 2021, May 2022, and August 20 22 survived the motion to dismiss, but his other retaliation \nclaims were dismissed. (Order Adopting Report and Recommendation [#30], at 2.) Plaintiff’s hostile \nwork environment claim was dismissed. (Order Adopting Report and Recommendation [#30], at 2.)  \n The Secretary subsequently filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [#31] claiming that \nPlaintiff lacks standing and that, as such, this Court lacks jurisdiction. The undersigned \nrecommended that the motion be granted as to Plaintiff’s claim for damages  [#39]. The undersigned \nalso recommended denying  the motion as to Plaintiff’s claim for injunctive relief but ordered \nPlaintiff to file a More Definite Statement clarifying the injunctive relief he is seeking and how such \nrelief would not violate federal  statutes or regulations. (Report and Rec. [#39], at 5.)  ] The District \nCourt adopted the undersigned’s Report and Recommendation  as to the Motion for Judgment on the \nPleadings  [#42].  Plaintiff filed his Injunctive Relief Statement  [#40], the Secretary  filed a Response \nand Renewed Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [#41] , Plaintiff replied  in support of his \nInjunctive Relief Statement and responded to the renewed motion  [#43] , and the Secretary filed a \nreply  [#44]. The motion is therefore ripe for the Cou rt’s review.  \nII.       Legal Standard  \nRule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides: “After the pleadings are \nclosed —but early enough not to delay trial —a party may move for judgment on the pleadings.”  Fed. Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 2 of 163 \n R. Civ. P. 12(c). The standard for dismissal under Rule 12(c) is the same as that for dismissal for \nfailure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). Johnson v. Johnson , 385 F.3d 503, 529 (5th Cir. 2004 ).  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain sufficient \nfactual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). “A \nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. Although a \ncomplaint “does n ot need detailed factual allegations,” the “allegations must be enough to raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555. The allegations pleaded must \nshow “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  \n Furthermore, a court must accept “all well -pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light \nmost favorable to the plaintiff.”  Martin K. Eby Const. Co. v. Dall.  Area Rapid Transit , 369 F.3d \n464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004). However, a court need not credit conclusory allegations or allegations that \nmerely restate the legal elements of a claim. Chhim v. Univ. of Tex . at Austin , 836 F.3d 467, 469 (5th \nCir. 2016) (citing Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678). In short, a claim should not be dismissed unless the court \ndetermines tha t it is beyond doubt that the plaintiff cannot prove a plausible set of facts that support \nthe claim and would justify relief. Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570.  \nIII.    Notification to the District Court of a Potential Violation of Rule 11(b)  \n The undersigned notifies the District Court that Plaintiff’s Reply In Support Of Plaintiff's \nInjunctive Relief Statement And Opposition To Defendant ’s Renewed Motion For Judgment On The \nPleading [#43] is rife with citations to cases that do not exist and mischaracterizations of other cases . \nMore specifically, two citations are to cases that do not exist . And alt hough many of the other cases  \nhe cites are real cases, he materially misrepresents the propositions these cases stand for, often Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 3 of 164 \n providing “hallucinated” quotes. It therefore appears that Plaintiff’s counsel likely used generative \nartificial intelligence (“ GenAI”) to assist in his research and, even more strikingly, did not bother  to \ncheck whether the GenAI-generated content was accurate.  \nFor instance, in support of his argument that it is permissible for the Court to order the Army \nto promote him, Plaintiff includes a material misstatement of the law. He writes : \nThe Fifth Circuit, which includes the Western District of Texas, has recognized that a \nrestorative assignment can be an appropriate remedy for discrimination. In the case \nof Palmer v. Shultz , 815 F.2d 84 (D.C. Cir. 1987), the court held that a restorative \nassignment was an appropriate remedy for a violation of the Rehabilitation Act. The \ncourt stated, “The Rehabilitation Act authorizes ‘affirmative action’ in favor of \nhandicapped individuals, and we see no reason why such action may not include an \norder requiring the agency to give the plaintiff a job for which he is qualified and \nwhich he was denied because of his handicap.”  \n \n(Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  20.) There are multiple problems with this paragraph. First, of course, a D.C. \nCircuit case does not support Plaintiff’s assertion that the Fifth Circuit  has recognized such a \nremedy.  Second, though Palmer is a real case, it is a Title VII  case about sex discrimination —not a \nRehabilitation Act case. Palmer , 815 F.2d at 89. In fact, the Palmer court never even mentions the \nRehabilitation Act. Third, the quote attributed by Plaintiff to Palmer is not in Palmer , nor is it \nfrom any case by any court  found in the undersigned’s search of multiple legal databases .1  \n The above quotation is not the only hallucinated quote or legal contention in the Reply brief . \nThere are several : \n• “In EEOC v. WC&M Enterprises, Inc. , 496 F.3d 393 (5th Cir. 2007), the court held that \nan employer's failure to provide training can constitute an adverse employment action \nunder Title VII. The court noted that ‘an employer's decision to deny training can be an \nadverse employment action if it affects an employee's compensation, terms, conditions, \nor privileges of employment. ’ Id. at 401. ” (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  14.)  \n \no The WC&M  Enterprises case is not about adverse employment actions . It does \nnot contain the quote cited by Plaintif f, and neither does any other  federal case . \n \n1 The Secretary represents in his Reply  [#44] that he also could not identify where this quote \ncame from.  Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 4 of 165 \n  \n• “The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that ‘an employer ’s refusal to make reasonable \naccommodations for a disabled employee constitutes discrimination under the ADA. ’ \nSee Delaval v. PTech Drilling Tubulars, L.L.C., 824 F.3d 476, 481 (5th Cir. 2016). ” (Pl. \nReply [#43], ¶  16.) \n \no Although this is a correct statement of law under the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, 42 U.S.C.  § 12112(b)(5)(A), and th e Delaval  case does involve  a failure -to-\naccommodate claim, this quote does not appear in the cited case.  \n \n• “The court has also recognized that retaliation claims under the ADA are cognizable \nwhen an employer takes adverse employment actions in response to an employee's \nrequest for reasonable accommodations. See E.E.O.C. v. LHC Group Inc., 773 F.3d 688, \n697 (5th Cir. 2014). ” (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  16.)  \n \no The LHC Group  case is not about a retaliation claim .  \n \n• “Moreover, the Fifth Circuit, which includes the Western District of Texas, has \nrecognized that anti -retaliation protections are essential to ensure that employees can \nassert their rights without  fear of reprisal. In Fabela v. Socorro Independent School \nDistrict, the court held that an employer ’s failure to implement an effective anti -\nretaliation policy could be evidence of a hostile work environment (329 F.3d 409 (5th \nCir. 2003)) .” (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  25.)  \n \no The Fabela  case did not involve a hostile work environment  claim  and does not \ndiscuss anti -retaliation policies.  \n \n• “In the case of EEOC v. AutoZone, Inc., No. 14 -1687 (7th Cir. 2015), the court approved \na consent decree that included the appointment of a third -party monitor to ensure \ncompliance with the decree ’s provisions. ” (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  27.)  \n \no 7th Circuit case no. 14 -1687 is an entirely different case ; that case number refers \nto Miller v. Greenleaf Orthopedic Assocs., S.C.  Although there are Seventh  \nCircuit opinions where the parties are the EEOC and AutoZone, Inc., these \nopinions do not discuss the appointment of a third -party monitor  related to a \nconsent decree.2 \n \n• “The Defendant ’s argument that the requested relief improperly asks the Court to usurp \nthe responsibilities of the Executive Branch is flawed. The Court ’s role in enforcing \n \n2 See E.E.O.C. v. AutoZone, Inc. , 707 F.3d 824 (7th Cir. 2013)  (not pertaining to a consent \ndecree or a third -party monitor); E.E.O.C. v.

In fact, the Supreme Court has held that ‘the \ncourts have been given a role in the enforcement of federal anti -discrimination laws, and \nit is not a minor one. ’ (Alexander v. Gardner -Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 56 (1974)). ” (Pl. \nReply [#43], ¶  30.)  \n \no The Alexander  case does not contain this quote, and neither does any other  \nfederal case (let alone a Supreme Court case).  \n \n• “In its Compliance Manual, the EEOC states that ‘courts have broad equitable powers to \nfashion remedies that will ensure compliance with the Act. ’ (EEOC Compliance Manual, \nSection 3: Remedies) .” (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  32.) \n \no This quote does not appear to exist in any EEOC document . Moreover, Section 3 \nof EEOC Compliance Manual  is about “Employee Benefits,”3 not “remedies ” as \nrepresented by Plaintiff.   \n \n• “In the case of Armstrong v. Turner Industries, Group, LLC, 141 F.3d 554, 562 (5th Cir. \n1998),4 the Fifth Circuit held that a court may order remedies to ensure compliance with \nthe Rehabilitation Act. The court stated, ‘The Rehabilitation Act is a broad mandate to \neliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities  . . . We have held that courts \nhave wide discretion to fashion remedies that ensure compliance with the Act. ’” (Pl. \nReply [#43], ¶  33.) \n \no This Armstrong  case is  not about the Rehabilitation Act. The above quote does \nnot appear in this case or any other  federal case.  \n \n• “The Defendant ’s argument also fails to recognize the role of the court in interpreting \nand applying federal regulations. In Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 -44 (1984), the Supreme Court held that courts must \ndefer to an agency ’s interpretation of a statute it administers unless the interpretation is \nunreasonable. ” (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  34.) \no Setting aside that this is a misstatement of Chevron ’s holding, Chevron  has been \nexplicitly overruled. Loper Bright Enter. v. Raimondo , 603 U.S. 369, 412 (2024) \n(“Chevron  is overruled.”).  \n \n• “The Court has the authority to order remedies that ensure compliance with federal anti -\ndiscrimination law. This authority is well established in case law. For example, in United \nStates v. City of Los Angeles, 595 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth Circuit held that \nthe district court had the authority to order the City of Los Angeles to comply with the \n \n3 See U.S. Equal Emp. Opportunity Comm’n, EEOC Compliance Manual: Section 3 \nEmployee Benefits  (Oct. 3, 2000), https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/section -3-employee -\nbenefits .  \n \n4 Although this is a real case, the correct name is Armstrong v. Turner Industries, Inc.  141 \nF.3d 554 .  Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 6 of 167 \n RA and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The court stated, ‘The district court has \nbroad discretion to fashion remedies once it has found a violation of law. ’” (Pl. Reply \n[#43], ¶  37.)  \n \no This opinion , “United States v. City of Los Angeles, 595 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. \n2010),”  simply does not exist . No case exists with that reporter citation . Nor \ndoes the quote come from any other federal case.  \n \n• “The Plaintiff has clearly articulated the specific actions required to remedy the \ndiscriminatory conduct, including targeted training, restorative assignment, and anti -\nretaliation measures. These requests are not vague but are specific actions that the Army \ncan take to remedy the alleged discriminatory conduct. See, e.g., EEOC v. AutoZone, \nInc., 707 F.3d 824, 840 (7th Cir. 2013) (upholding an injunction requiring specific anti -\ndiscrimination measures). ” (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  40.) \n \no Though this opinion does affirm in part a permanent injunction  related to \ndisability discrimination , the provided pincite does not include any holding by \nthe court. Moreover, the injunctive relief pertained solely to accommodations for \nemployees with disabilities —not to targeted training, restorative assignments, or \nanti-retaliation measures. See id.  at 841 –44. \n \n• “Further, the relief sought by the Plaintiff is consistent with the law and jurisdiction of \nthe Texas Western District. The Texas Western District has recognized that injunctive \nrelief can include specific measures to remedy discriminatory conduct. See, e.g., EEOC \nv. Exxon Mobil  Corp., No. SA -03-CA-159-FB, 2006 WL 2616827, at *1 (W.D. Tex. \nSept. 11, 2006) (granting an injunction requiring specific anti -discrimination measures). ” \n(Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  43.) \n \no This opinion —which Plaintiff represents was written by this very District \nCourt —does not exist. Moreover, no case is assigned the Westlaw citation \nprovided.  \n \nBeyond the extreme pattern of hallucinated legal citati ons summarized above , it appears that \nPlaintiff’s counsel may have utilized GenAI to write some or all of his brief.  For instance , Plaintiff’s \nReply uses the phrase “The Fifth Circuit, which includes the Western District of Texas, has \nrecognized . . .” three separate times. (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶¶ 14, 20, 25.) The Court is well aware that it \nis within the Fifth Circuit. Such repetitive, redundant language makes the undersigned  suspicious \nthat Plaintiff use d a gen AI tool in an inappropriate manner . It strains credulity that an attorney would Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 7 of 168 \n feel the need to inform  judge s in the Western District of Texas of the Circuit in which they sit —let \nalone three times .  \n Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), by presenting this brief to the Court , Plaintiff’s \ncounsel has “certifie[d] to the best of [his] knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an \ninquiry reasonable under the circumstances,” that the “legal contentions are warranted by existing \nlaw.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b). Plaintiff has not lived up to this certification with this brief. T he District \nCourt  should consider whether it is appropriate to sanction Plaintiff’s counsel under Rule 11(c)  \nbased on his inappro priate use of GenAI . Appropriate sanctions may include a monetary penalty  \nand/or a requirement to attend a continuing legal education course on the topic of generative AI . See \nGauthier v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. , No. 1:23 -CV-281, 2024 WL 4882651 , at *3  (E.D. Tex. \nNov. 25, 2024)  (requiring an attorney who cited quotes and cases that do not exist to pay a $2000 \npenalty to the Court , attend a generative AI continuing legal education course , and send a copy of the \ncourt’s order to his client ).  \nPlaintiff’s conduct in this case  may also  violate the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional \nConduct. The Professional Ethics Committee for the State Bar of Texas has provided the opinion \nthat a “ lawyer’s failure to verify generative AI outputs can implicate a host of Rules, including Rule \n1.01 (Competent and Diligent Representation), Rule 3.01 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions), \nRule 3.03 (Candor Toward the Tribunal), and Rule 3.04 (Fairness in Adjudicatory Proceedings), \namong others. ” The Professional  Ethics Committee for the  State Bar of Texas , Opinion No. 705 \n(Feb. 2025),  https://tcle -web.s3.amazonaws.com/public/documents/Opinion_705.pdf .  \nIV.       Analysis  of the Pending Motion  \n The Secretary argued in his Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings [#31] that Plaintiff’s \nsought -after remedies do not redress his injuries and that he therefore does not have standing. See Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 8 of 169 \n Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 559 –61 (1992) (explaining that a redressable injury is \nrequired for Article III standing, which is itself a requirement for a federal court to have \njurisdiction) ; TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) (discussing that it is the \nplaintiff’s burden to show that his injury would likely be redressed by judicial relief).  Plaintiff’s \nclaims are brought under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, codified at 29 U.S.C. §  794(a). As \nexplained in the undersigned’s previous Report and Recommendation [#39], §  504 does not “waive \nthe Federal Government’s sovereign immunity against monetary damages awards for Executive \nagencies’ violations of § 504(a).” Lane v. Pena , 518 U.S. 187, 192 –93 (1996).  Plaintiff’s claims for \ndamages were therefore dismissed [#42].  \nThere is still the possibility, however, that injunctive relief is available and would redress \nPlaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff’s Injunctive Relief Statement  [#40]  and Reply in Support [#43]  explain \nthat he is seeking four types of injunctive relief: (1) “comprehensive and up -to-date training in the \nDefense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) system and other relevant supply -related \nsystems ”; (2) a “restorative assignment,” i.e., a promotion to a position comparable to the positions \nhe had applied for  but was denied ; (3) “the appointment of a neutral third party, such as an Equal \nEmployment Opportunity (EEO) officer or a Human Resources (HR) official” to ensure compliance \nwith the Court’s orders on injunctive relief ; and (4) anti -retaliation protections, including mandatory \ntraining on preventing retaliation and discrimination, a monitoring system to track adverse \nemployment actions taken against Plaintiff, a reporting mechanism for Plaintiff to report any \nincidents of retaliation or discrimination , and  a prohibition on individuals who previously \nparticipated in discriminatory decisions against Plaintiff from participating in future employment \ndecisions about Plaintiff.  (Pl. More Definite Statement [#40], at 1 –3; Pl. Reply [#43], at 4–8.)  \nA.        Updated training would  not redress Plaintiff’s  alleged injuries.  Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 9 of 1610 \n As to Plaintiff’s request for updated training, the undersigned agrees with the Secretary that \nsuch a remedy would not redress Plaintiff’s injuries. He pleaded that the failure -to-promote incidents \nwere caused solely by his disability and that he had been more qualified than the applicants selected \nover him. Under Plaintiff’s theory of the case, additional training was unnecessary for a promotion .5 \nAdditional training would therefore not remedy Plaintiff’s alleged injuries.  \nB.        Plaintiff has not met his burden to explain how the Court may order the Secretary to  \npromote him without violating federal statutes.  \n \nNext, Plaintiff  requests a “restorative assignment,”6 which he describes  as a “comparable \nposition” to the positions for which he had applied and was denied, allegedly due to discrimination \nor retaliation .7 The Secretary represented  in his Reply in Support of his original  Motion for \nJudgment on the Pleading s that the positions Plaintiff applied for a re “competitive service” positions . \n(Secretary Reply [#35], at 4.) Federal regulations mandate that vacancies  in such positions must be \nfilled “by any method authorized in this chapter, including competitive appointment from a list of \neligibles, noncompetitive appointment under special authority, reinstatement, transfer, reassignment, \nchange to lower grade, or promotion. ” See 5 C.F.R. §  330.102. Moreover, the Office of Personnel \nManagement ensures that federal agencies  comply with “open competition principles,” as mandated \nby federal regulation s. See 5 C.F.R. §  330.503.  The undersigned therefore ordered that Plaintiff’s \n \n5 To the extent Plaintiff pleaded that he was denied training as part of a hostile -work -\nenvironment claim, his hostile -work -environment claim was dismissed by the District Court as \nrecommended by the undersigned [#30].  \n \n6 The Secretary takes issue with the term “restorative,” as Plaintiff has maintained his job \nwith the Army ; he has not been demoted or discharged . (Secretary Reply  [#44], at 4.)  \n \n7 Plaintiff’s Injunctive Relief Statement [#40] asked for the “identification and availability of \na comparable position within the pharmacy supply sector, with salary and responsibilities similar to \nthose previously denied.” His Reply in Support [#43] clarifies that he is intending to ask for \nplacement in such a position.  Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 10 of 1611 \n More Definite Statement on what injunctive relief he is seeking explain how his sought -after relief \nwould not violate federal  statutes or  regulations. (Report and Recommendation [#39], at 5.)  \nPlaintiff ’s Injunctive Relief Statement [#40] does not even attempt  to explain how promoting \nhim would not violate these regulations . Nor does Plaintiff provide legal authority for his contention \nthat this is an appropriate injunctive remedy under the Rehabilitation Act. In fact, the only legal \nprecedent he cites in his Reply in Support [#43]  to support his argument for this injunctive remedy is \na made -up quotation, as discussed in Section III, supra . Beyond the “hallucinated” legal contention, \nPlaintiff does not cite to any other case law supporting that the Court may order the Army  to \npromote him  without violating federal regulations , nor has the undersigned found  case law  from any \njurisdiction  in support of such a remedy.  \nC.        Plaintiff’s request for “clear safeguards” is moot or otherwise impermissible .  \nAs to Plaintiff’s request for “clear safeguards against any adverse actions influenced by \nindividuals involved in prior discriminatory or retaliatory conduct,” these requested  remedies are \nmoot or otherwise impermissible. Plaintiff’s request that the Army require its employees to \nparticipate in mandatory training on preventing retaliation and discrimination is moot, as the Army \nalready provides such training. See Army Regulation 690 –12, Civilian Personnel Equal Employment \nOpportunity Programs (Feb. 6, 2025), located at \nhttps://api.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/2025/02/21/551aeef9/ar -690-12-civilian -personnel -equal -\nemployment -opportunity -programs.pdf .8 Chapter 7 of this regulation requires that EEO training be \nprovided to all civil ian employees and that this training must include “the provisions of the Federal \nEmployee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation (No FEAR) Act. ” Id. at 7-2. Moreover, the Army is \nalready required to have an affirmative action  program  plan in place for individuals with disabilities \n \n8 The undersigned may take judicial notice of matters of public record. Norris v. Hearst \nTrust , 500 F.3d 454, 461 n.9 (5th Cir. 2007) . Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 11 of 1612 \n and already may not retaliate against those who make complaints related to disability discrimination. \nSee 29 U.S.C. §  791 (requiring federal agencies to have an affirmative action program plan for the \nhiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities); 29 C.F.R.  § 1614.102 (same); \n29 U.S.C. §  794(d) (explicitly incorporating the Americans with Disabilities Act’s anti -retaliation \nprovisions into the Rehabilitation Act). The affirmative action program  must include reviewing \nmanagerial and su pervisory performance to ensure “vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal \nopportunity.” 29 C.F.R.  § 1614.102(a)(5).  \nPlaintiff fails to explain how the above regulations regarding training on anti -discrimination \nand anti -retaliation principles are not sufficient. As pointed out by the Secretary, he does not make \nany allegations regarding these policies, i.e., that the training is insufficient or was not followed with \nrespect to his applications. Moreover, this Court may not grant an injunction “simply telling a party \nto ‘obey the law,’” and Plaintiff does not provide the Court with any specific proposed relief that \nwould go beyond the Army’s already -existing regulatory obligations. See Carter v. Loc. 556, \nTransport Workers Union of Am. , 138 F.4th 164 , 204  (5th Cir. 2025)  (citing Payne v. Travenol \nLab’ys, Inc. , 565 F.2d 895, 897 –98 (5th Cir. 1978) (“ . . . [O]ur court has long held that injunctions \nsimply telling a party to ‘obey the law ’ are improper. ”). Plaintiff himself represents that he “is not \nasking the Court to dictate policy but rather to enforce existing federal law, specifically the \n[Rehabilitation Act].” (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  36.)  \nAs to Plaintiff’s proposed injunctive relief of ordering the Army to create a  reporting \nmechanism for him “to report any incidents of retaliation or discrimination”  and a “monitoring \nsystem to track adverse employment actions ” against him,  these suggestions also appear to be \nimpermissible under federal regulations. 29 C.F.R. §  1614.103 requires Rehabilitation Act claims to \n“be processed  in accordance with this part.” Plaintiff does not attempt to explain  how his having a Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 12 of 1613 \n reporting mechanism  specifically designed for his personal use  would be  permissible under t his \nregulation. Similarly, 29 C.F.R.  § 1614.102 (a) requires federal agencies to “[a]ppraise its personnel \noperations at regular intervals to assure their conformity with its” affirmative action program , “[t]ake \nappropriate disciplinary action against employees who engage in discriminatory practices,” and \n“[r]eview, evaluate and control managerial and supervisory performance in such a manner as to \ninsure a continuing affirmative application and vigorous enforcement of the policy of equal \nopportunity .” Again, Plaintiff does not state why a personalized monitoring system is permissible or \nnecessary based on the already -existing requirements.  \nPlaintiff is also requesting that Army employees who he contends discriminated against him \nbe prohibited from participating in decisions related to his employment. Again, Plaintiff has cited no \nauthority for his contention that this is an injunctive remedy that this Court is empowered to order  \nunder the Rehabilitation Act, even assuming that Plaintiff  could prevail on his Rehabilitation Act  \nclaim. And, of course, any Army employees who engage in illegal discrimination are already subject \nto “appropriate dis ciplinary action .” See 29 C.F.R.  § 1614.102(a)(6) . The Army must comply with \nthe applicable regulations on employee discipline in such circumstances.  \nD.        Plaintiff’s request for appointment of a neutral third party is moot.  \nThe final equitable remedy requested by Plaintiff —the appointment of a neutral third party to \nensure compliance with the other injunctive relief granted by the Court —is moot, as none of the \nother types of proposed injunctive relief are permissible.  \nE.         Plaintiff’s overall argument as to why federal regulations do not restrain this Court is\n inapposite.   \n Finally, Plaintiff asserts in his Reply in Support [#43] of his Injunctive Relief Statement that \nthe Secretary cannot rely on regulatory mandates to argue that the Court has no authority to order \ncertain remedies. He cites as support  Alexander v. Gardner -Denver Co. , 415 U.S. 36 , 56 (1974) , and Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 13 of 1614 \n Armstrong v. Turner Indus. , Inc. , 141 F.3d 554 (5th Cir. 1998) . But as noted in Section III, supra , \nthe quote s Plaintiff attributes to those two cases are made -up quote s not found in those cases  or any \nother case. He then cites to the Rehabilitation Act itself and its remedies provisio n. This provision \n(29 U.S.C. §  794a(a)(2)) points to the remedies provision in  Title VI (42 U.S.C. §  2000 d). Plaintiff \ndoes not provide any (real)  case law supporting that promotion is a permissible remedy under either \nstatute, either for private employers or the federal government.   \n Plaintiff also references  Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , \n467 U.S. 837, 843 –44 (1984) . As stated previously in Section III, supra , this case has been \noverturned. Loper Bright Enter ., 603 U.S. at 412. Yet, even if Chevron were still good law, \nPlaintiff’s argument is inapposite; Chevron is about interpretation of regulations. What is at issue \nhere is compliance with regulations —and Plaintiff provides no support on this topic.  \n Plaintiff subsequently attempts to distinguish Scott v. Schedler , 826 F.3d 207, 213 (5th Cir. \n2016) , which the Secretary cites as support for his argument that the Court cannot rewrite federal \nregulations and “act as an executive or legislative agent of the state.” Plaintiff responds that his case \nis different because he is “not asking the Court to dictate policy but rather to enforce existing federal \nlaw, specifically the [Rehabilitation Act].” (Pl. Reply [#43], ¶  36.) What  Plaintiff fails to understand , \nhowever, is that the primary concern at issue here is not whether the Court can generally order the \nExecutive Branch to act —rather, the primary concern is whether the Court can order the Executive \nBranch to take actions that are inconsistent with statutory and regulatory requirements  that apply to \nthe Executive B ranch . Plaintiff has not provided the Court with any precedent showing it may do so.  \nThus, Plaintiff has failed to request any injunctive relief that would be permissible and would \nredress his injuries. He therefore lacks standing, and the Court should grant the Secretary’s Renewed \nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings [#4 1]. Case 5:24-cv-00276-FB     Document 45     Filed 08/28/25     Page 14 of 1615 \n V.     Conclusion  and Recommendation  \nPlaintiff has failed to demonstrate that there are any permissible remedies that would redress \nhis injuries. He therefore lacks standing to bring this action.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Leila Kasso, a former Minneapolis Police officer, filed a motion to compel the City of Minneapolis to produce documents related to her Title VII discrimination lawsuit against the Police Officers’ Federation of Minneapolis. The court addressed 23 requests for documents and electronically stored information, granting only one of them while finding the others irrelevant, overly burdensome, or beyond the permissible scope of a subpoena. Artificial intelligence plays a role in the case as the City accused Kasso of using fictitious case law likely generated by AI to support her claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether the City of Minneapolis, a non-party to Kasso’s discrimination lawsuit against the Police Federation, should be compelled to produce the requested documents and electronically stored information.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted in part and denied in part Kasso's motion to compel. It allowed the request for certain disciplinary files covering 2018 to 2020 but denied the other 22 requests due to their irrelevance, undue burden on the non-party City, or non-compliance with procedural rules. The court also denied Kasso’s additional requests for costs and fees, waiver of the City's objections, and an adverse inference instruction. Additionally, the court criticized the use of fictitious legal citations that appeared to be generated by AI.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: A former police officer named Leila Kasso asked the court to make the City of Minneapolis give her a bunch of papers and electronic records to help her case against a police union. The court decided she could only get one set of specific files. Most of her requests were too much work for the City, weren't useful enough for her case, or didn't follow the rules. The court also said it seems like she might have used fake legal information made by a computer program, which is a problem because you can't use made-up stuff in court.",
    "full_text": " \n1 \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nDISTRICT OF MINNESOTA  \n \nLeila Kasso ,  \nPlaintiff,  \nv. \nPolice Officers’  \nFederation of Minneapolis , \n \nDefendant.  \n  \nCase No. 2 3-cv-2777  (KMM /DLM)  \n \n \n \nORDER ON PLAINTIFF’S SECOND \nMOTION TO COMPEL RULE 45 \nSUBPOENA  \n \n \n \n This matter is before the Court on pro se Plaintiff  Leila Kasso’s  Second  Motion to \nCompel Rule 45 Subpoena . (Doc s. 103, (Motion), 105 (Memorandum) .) Ms. Kasso seeks \nto compel the production of documents and electronically stored information (“ESI”) from \nnon-party City of Minneapolis  (“the City”). The City opposes Ms. Kasso’s subpoena, and \nargues that her motion should be denied. (Docs. 113 (Memorandum in Opposition), 112 \n(Declaration).)  The matter is now fully submitted and the motion is ripe for decision. For \nthe reasons explained below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Ms. Kasso’s \nSecond Motion to Compel Rule 45 Subpoena (Doc. 103).   \nBACKGROUND  \nPro se Plaintiff Leila Kasso is a former Minneapolis Police officer  who alleges \ndiscriminatory treatment  on the basis of race and sex by  the Polic e Officers’ Federation \nof Minneapolis (“ the Federation”)  in violation of Title VII.  (Doc. 58 .) Ms. Kasso  filed her \noriginal complaint against the Federation  on September 8, 2023,  alleging many  causes of \naction, including violations of Title VII, violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 1 of 20 \n2 \n (“ADA”), age discrimination, defamation, retaliation, and other claims . (Doc. 1.)  Along \nwith the Federation, she named as defendants  in her original complaint  the City of \nMinneapolis and the City of Minneapolis Police Department (“MPD”) . (Id.) On January \n5, 2025, Ms. Kasso, filed a Second Amended Complaint against the Federation  only, \neffectively dismissing the City and MPD from the lawsuit. (Doc. 58.)1  \nOn January 19, 2025, t he Federation moved to  dismiss  Ms. Kasso’s Second \nAmended Complaint . (Doc. 59 .) The Court granted in part and den ied in part th at Motion  \n(Doc. 87 .) Relevant here , Judge Menendez dismissed all but Plaintiff’s  Title VII claim  for \nrace and sex discrimination , finding that Ms. Kasso  had pled facts sufficient to state a \n“straightforward claim that the Federation both undermined her employment with the \nMPD after a medical episode and then failed to assist her in re -securing her employment \nin the manner it would have done for a white, male officer —even one facing far more \nserious employment disputes.” ( Id. at 9.)  \nOnce discovery began, Ms . Kasso propounded a Rule 45 subpoena duces tecum  on \nthe City on July 22, 2025 . (Doc. 104 -4.) The City timely objected to Plaintiff’s subpoena \non August, 5, 2025. (Doc. 112 -1.) 2 The record reflects that attempts to meet -and-confer  \nin good -faith pursuant to  Local Rule 7.1 were unsuccessful. ( See generally  Doc. 104 -7.)  \n \n1 However,  Ms. Kasso maintains an ongoing parallel suit against the City ( Kasso v. City \nof Minneapolis et al., 23-cv-2782)  broadly  arising from the same set of circumstances . \n2 Ms. Kasso’s contention that the City has waived its right to object lacks merit. Rule 45 \ndirects  that an objection “must be served before the earlier of the time specified for \ncompliance or 14 days after the subpoena is served.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(2)(B).  \nMs. Kasso served the City with a subpoena on July 22, 2025. (Doc. 104 -4.) The City \nobjected on August, 5, 2025 —within  fourteen days of service of  Ms. Kasso ’s subpoena. \n(Doc. 112 -1.) The City therefore timely objected to Ms. Kasso’s subpoena.   CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 2 of 20 \n3 \n Ms. Kasso’s  subpoena,  which includes 23 requests, seeks a wide  range of \ndocuments , ESI, and other information  that Plaintiff alleges are relevant to her  original \nbevy of claims against the Federation, even though  the Court dismissed  the overwhelming \nmajority of those claims . (See generally  Doc. 104 -3.) In her Memorandum in Support of \nher Motion to Compel, Ms. Kasso generally contends that the City’s refusal to produce \ndiscovery threatens her ability to prepare for trial. (Doc. 105 at 1.) She makes few  directed \narguments in support of her Motion, but does argue at length that the City’s objections are \nwithout merit. ( See generally  Doc. 105.)   \nThe City  object s to each of Plaintiff’s requests . Primarily, the City objects because , \nfrom its perspective, Ms.  Kasso’s  requests are  largely irrelevant  to her Title VII claim . But \neven where her requests are marginally relevant,  the City argues  that her requests are \nunduly burdensome  on a non -party.  The City further contends  that Plaintiff’s Motion \nshould be denied because  she has “wasted” the Court ’s and counsel’s time by usin g \nfictitious caselaw  likely generated by Artificial Intelligence (“AI”)  and because she has \n“refused” to meet and confer according to Local Rule 7.1.  (Doc. 113 at 1.) Ultimately, \ngiven the breadth and depth of discovery Ms. Kasso seeks, the City urges the Court to \nunderstand her Motion as an  attempt to contravene the discovery limitations in her parallel \ncase against the City  and deny it accordingly . (Id.)  \n  CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 3 of 20 \n4 \n ANALYSIS  \nI. PLAINTIFF’S SECOND MOTION TO COMPEL RULE 45 SUBPOENA IS \nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.  \n \nRule 26 of the Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure establishes  that the scope of  \ndiscovery  in a civil case  is limited to all non-privileged information that is “relevant to \nany party’s claim or defense and proportional  to the needs of the case .” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n26(b)(1).  Courts construe the scope of Rule 26(b)(1) broadly, see Oppenheimer Fund, Inc. \nv. Sanders , 437 U.S. 340, 351 (1978)  (citing Hickman v. Taylor , 329 U.S. 495, 501 (1947) ), \nbut the scope of discovery includes only what is relevant to the actual claims or defenses \nthat are at issue, see Sherman v. Sheffield Fin., LLC , 338 F.R.D. 247, 252 (D. Minn. 2021) . \nAnd it is the party that seeks discovery who must make a threshold showing that the \ninformation sought is relevant to the claims or defenses in the case. Id. (citing  Hofer v. \nMack Trucks, Inc ., 981 F.2d 377, 380 (8th Cir. 1992) ). If that occurs, then “the party \nresisting production bears the burden of establishing lack of relevancy or undue burden.” \nInline Packaging, LLC v. Graphic Packaging Int’l, Inc. , No. 15-cv-3183 (ADM/LIB), \n2016 WL 6997113, at *7 (D. Minn. Sept. 6, 2016)  (quoting St. Paul Reinsurance Co. v. \nCom.  Fin. Corp. , 198 F.R.D. 508, 511 (N.D. Iowa 2000) ). \nBeyond being relevant, Rule 26 requires that information sought in discovery also \nbe “proportional to the needs of the case.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Factors important to a \ncourt’s proportionality analysis include “the importance of the issues at stake i n the action, \nthe amount in controversy, the parties’ relative access to relevant information, the parties’ \nresources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 4 of 20 \n5 \n or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.” Id. Along with these  \nconstraints , a district court “ must limit discovery if it determines that it can be obtained \nfrom some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive.” \nJohnson Tr . of Operating Eng’rs v. Charps  Welding & Fabricating, Inc ., 950 F.3d 510, \n524-25 (8 th Cir. 2020) .  \nWhen a party wishes to compel a nonparty to produce discovery in a lawsuit, Rule \n45 provides that a nonparty may be commanded by subpoena to “produce designated \ndocuments, electronically stored information, or tangible things in that person’s \npossession, c ustody, or control.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(a). But “[a] party or attorney \nresponsible for issuing and serving a subpoena must take reasonable steps to avoid \nimposing undue burden or expense on a person subject to the subpoena.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n45(d)(1). When a non -party is subpoenaed , the concern for burden under Rule 45 (d)(1)  \ncarries  “special weight” in a court’s  analysis. In re Pork Antitrust Litigation , No. 18 -cv-\n1776 (JRT/HB), 2022 WL 972401, at *7 (D. Minn. March 31, 2022)  (“Concern for the \nburden on a non-party subject to a subpoena carries special weight when balancing \ncompeting needs .”). This concern  reflects the reality that non -parties , unlike parties to a \ncivil action,  neither  anticipate nor elect to expose themselves  to discovery processes . \nWhen a Rule  45 subpoena imposes undue burden on a non -party  or requests irrelevant \ninformation , the Court must quash or modify that subpoena. Id.; Fed. R. Civ. P. \n45(d)(3)(A)(iv).                 CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 5 of 20 \n6 \n Ms. Kasso propounds 23 distinct requests upon the City, a non -party to this action. \nThe Court  considers each of Ms. Kasso’s requests, balancing the considerations set out by \nRule 26 and Rule 45  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  \nA. Ms. Kasso’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to Request s No. 1 -7, 13 -15.   \n \nIn these requests, Ms. Kasso seeks  “ESI and Phone Records” for nine non-party \nCity employees : John Laluzerne, Thomas Schmid, Henry Halvorson, David Garman , Bob \nKroll, Eric Hagle, Destiny Xiong, Erin Grabowski , and Medaria Arradondo.  (Doc. 104 -3 \nat 3-9.) She requests the work cell phone number associated with each individual; all text \nmessages sent or received by each individual on any work cell phone or device ; a log of \nall numbers called and received by each individual on any work cell phone or device ; and \nall City of Minneapolis email data from the named individuals’ official email account, \nincluding content and attachments.  (Id.) While the temporal scope of her requests varies \nper request , Request Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 13, and 14 seek documents and ESI from before  the \nyear 2018.3 (See Doc. 104 -3 at 3,4, 6 -9.) As to Request No. 15, Ms. Kasso seeks  only \ncontact details for a former MPD Lieutenant Richard Jackson. (Doc. 104 -3 at 10.)  \nMs. Kasso contends  that the information she seeks  in these requests is relevant  to \nher Title VII claim against the Federation, as well as to her original host of claims  \ndismissed by the Court . The City object s, noting that these requests are not relevant to \nshow that the Federation selectively assists white male officers; that the requests are not \nproportional to the needs of the case ; and that the requests are not fashioned to limit burden \n \n3 The Court has determined that the relevant temporal scope for Plaintiff’s Title VII claim \nis likely 2018 to 2020. (Doc. 87 at 10.) CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 6 of 20 \n7 \n on a non -party. In support of its last point, t he City asserts that producing the email  data \nfrom these individuals ’ accounts  alone would amount to a more than a million email  \nrecords. (Doc. 113 at 5 .)  \nAs an initial matter, the Court reiterates that  Rule 45 subpoenas duces tecum  govern \nthe production of “documents, electronically stored information, or tangible things .” Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 45(a)(B).  Ms. Kasso ’s requests for non -party phone numbers and addresses are \nnot request s for documents, ESI, or a tangible thing s. While Rule 33 may command that \nsort of information  (though only against parties) , Rule 45 does not. Accordingly, the Court \ndenies these requests to the extent Ms. Kasso seeks information that lies beyond the ambit \nof Rule 45. Request No. 15 is denied fully on this basis.  \nSecondly , these requests are not relevant . In almost every request, Ms. Kasso seeks \ndiscovery related to claims that  are no longer a part of her lawsuit.  But Rule 26 makes \ndiscoverable only nonprivileged information that is relevant to a party’s claim or defense. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).  In short, Ms. Kasso’s requests must be relevant to her operative \nclaim , that is,  her Title VII claim against the Federation. Yet Ms. Kasso repeatedly invokes \nher dismissed claims as the basis of relevance in these requests . Ms. Kasso’s requests are \ntherefore  denied insofar as they invoke her dismissed claims.  The Court also denies these \nrequests where they seek information beyond the relevant temporal scope determined by \nthe Court . \nTo the extent that Ms. Kasso does seek information relevant to her Title VII claim, \nthese requests must be denied because they run afoul of  Rule 26’s proportionality \nrequirement. In seeking all email, text, and phone records related to these individuals CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 7 of 20 \n8 \n without limitation, Ms. Kasso requests a sea of information in which she would find little \nto do with her claim against the Federation. No doubt, these requests encompass some \nrelevant information: casting so wide a net, how could one not catch a few fish? But as \nwritten, the Court cannot grant th ese request s. Plaintiff’s requests are simply too broad, \nand their relevance too meager, to satisfy Rule 26’s proportionality requirement.  \nThe overbreadth of Ms. Kasso’s requests marks a failure to reduce the burden on \nthe City as required by Rule 45. As the City observes, compliance with these requests \nwould compel a non -party to produce, review, and redact more than a million emails  alone. \n(Doc. 112 at 5.) Attention to the “special weight” that burden on non -parties merits in the \nRule 45 analysis, and to the foregoing considerations, calls for denial of these requests.  \nB. Ms. Kasso ’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to  Request s No. 8  and No. 20.  \nIn Request No. 8, Ms. Kasso compels the production of  Visinet Case Records and \nESI concerning her bicycle accident on May 20, 20 18. (Doc. 104 -3 at 7 .) Plaintiff argues \nonly that these records are relevant to “the reported basis of the City’s claim of defense.” \n(Id.)  \nThrough Request No. 20, Plaintiff seeks comprehensive information about  her \ninsurance coverage by Medica Insurance during her employment with the City of \nMinneapolis. (Doc. 104 -3 at 13.) She states that this information is relevant to show that \nthe City “knew in November 30, 2018 they had no intention to reinstate Plaintiff.”  (Id.)  \nAlthough Ms. Kasso declares  otherwise ( See Doc. 104 -3 at 1), t he City is not a \ndefendant to this action . It is a non -party. Because it is not a defendant, it has no defense \nthat could provide a basis of relevance under Rule 26. What the City knew , and when , CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 8 of 20 \n9 \n may be relevant to Ms. Kasso’s suit against the City, but not her suit against the \nFederation. The Court denies th ese request s. \nC. Ms. Kasso ’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to  Request No. 9 . \nIn this request, Ms. Kasso seeks  “Court and Arbitration Case Numbers (Career to \nPresent): for John Laluzerne, Eric Hagle, Bob Kroll, David Garman, Sherry Appledorn, \nTroy Carlson, David O’Conner. ” (Doc. 104 -3 at 7.) Ms. Kasso states that these records \nare relevant to show how the named individuals enjoyed “decades of benefits from the \nFederation.  . . yet the Federation failed to assist the Plaintiff. . . ” (Id.) The City objects. It \nargues that Ms. Kasso’s request should be understood as an interrogatory directed at a \nnon-party ; that court records are publicly available and compelling production  from a non -\nparty imposes an undue burden; and lastly  that the Federation is better equipped to supply \ndiscov ery related to labor arbitrations . (Doc. 113 at 24). ) \nAs the City  correctly  notes, Plaintiff’s  request for the numbers related to certain \ncourt cases and arbitration records constitutes  an interrogatory properly governed by Rule \n33, which cannot be propounded against a non -party . In any event,  this request would \nunduly burden  a non -party. Court case numbers are publicly available and do not require \nuse of a Rule 45 subpoena. Arbitration records, though not publicly available, are more \nappropriately sourced from the party to this action, the Federation.  For these reasons, the \nCourt denies this request.   \nD. Ms. Kasso ’s Motion to Compel is Granted  as to  Request No. 10. \nIn this request,  Ms. Kasso moves the Court for an Order compel ling the  production \nof disciplinary files held by City related to Bob Kroll, David Garman, John Laluzerne, CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 9 of 20 \n10 \n Thomas Schmid, Pete Brazaeu, Heather Jorges, Sherry Appledorn, and Sherral Schmidt. \n(Doc. 104 -3 at 8 .) Ms. Kasso further requests that the City produce these files in their \nnative format, with all associated metadata, transcripts, and outcomes. (Doc. 104 -3 at 7-\n8.) Among other claims, s he asserts that the se files are relevant to show that the Federation \ndiscriminates by selectively assisting white, male officers —such as the named officers \nhere—in workplace disputes . (Doc. 104 -3 at 7 -8.) The City argues that the request should \nbe denied because Ms. Kasso  seeks confidential information that  harms privacy interests ; \nbecause the request is not time -limited; and because Ms.  Kasso makes no showing that \nthe named individuals  were similarly situated to herself. (Doc. 113 at 26 .) \nBalancing  both parties’ positions, the Court grants this request  as to the years 201 8 \nthrough 2020 . In a Motion to Compel, Ms. Kasso need not prove her case  in full —she \nonly needs to meet the threshold  showing  set out in Rule 26 and 45.  Here, Ms. Kasso  has \nmade that showing . At this point in litigation, Ms. Kasso need not  prove that these officers \nwere similarly situated to herself for the purposes of her Title VII claim. The Court also \ndetermines that the privacy interests are not outweighed by Plaintiff’s interest in these \nfiles. And a lthough a non -party, the City is best situated  to provide the requested \ndocuments, and the burden imposed is not undue.4 Accordingly, Plaintiff’s  Motion to \nCompel is granted as to  Request No. 10 to the extent Ms. Kasso seeks disciplinary files  \nfor the named individuals  from the years 2018  through 2020.   \n  \n \n4 While the City frequently objects to the format of production requested by Ms. Kasso, it \ndoes not do so here.  CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 10 of 20 \n11 \n E. Ms. Kasso ’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to  Request No. 11 . \nMs. Kasso  next request s a list of “dollar amounts” the City  has paid out t o a list of \nnine named individuals “in Criminal or Civil cases due to the following officers’ actions \nor inactions .” (Doc. 104 -3 at 8.) Plaintiff argues that the relevance of these files relates to \n“comparative analyses” on the City’s payouts to white officers , to demonstrate that  the \nCity maintains employment of  “mostly White male officers who repeatedly cause \nviolations  working in the City of Minneapolis and backed by the Federation .” (Id.) \nThe Court denies this request . While arguably  topical, a  comprehensive evaluation \nof settlement  pay-outs is not relevant  to Ms. Kasso’s claim against the Federation  nor \nproportional to the needs of this case . Moreover , civil settlement records are publicly \navailable through the City’s own webpage  such that Ms. Kasso d oes not need a Rule 45 \nsubpoena to access the information she seeks. For these reasons, Plaintiff’s request No. \n11 is denied.  \nF. Ms. Kasso ’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to  Request No. 12 .  \nIn this request, Plaintiff seeks  employment reviews of Bob Kroll and David \nGarman from January 1, 2005 -January 1, 200 9, to demonstrate , she argues , the advantage s \nenjoyed by these two white male officers compared to  the Plaintiff, a Black female . (Doc. \n104-3 at 8 .) Other disqualifying reasons aside, Plaintiff’s request falls well outside the \nrelevant temporal scope for her claim . Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel is denied as to Request \nNo. 12.  \n  CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 11 of 20 \n12 \n G. Ms. Kasso ’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to  Request s No. 1 6, 17, 22.  \nThrough Request No. 16 , Ms. Kasso seeks a trove of ESI and documents related to \nMPD officer Molly Fischer’s apparent concussion, including her medical file, hospital \ndocumentation, case number, police report, medical authorization, the identity of the \nFederation Representative notified to assist her, and any reinstatement processes Ms. \nFischer underwent to return to work. (Doc. 104 -3 at 10.) Ms. Kasso states that these \ndocuments are relevant to show a “pattern and practice of discrimination.” ( Id.) The City  \nobjects, noting that this request is, essentially, a nine -part interrogatory directed toward a \nnon-party. (Doc. 113 at 30.)  \nThrough Request No. 17, Ms. Kasso seeks  ESI related to  the “Work force database \nfor the Fourth Precinct with a copy of all shifts and departments in the Minneapolis fourth \nprecinct from January 1, 2018 , January 1, 2019 and from January 1, 2020 -January 1, 2022” \nin order to determine the identi ty of the “White male officer with whom suffered [sic] a \nsever e accident .” (Doc. 104 -3 at 10-11.) Plaintiff suggests this information is relevant to \nshow how the Federation assisted this unidentified white male officer who suffered a head \ninjury, assistance w hich the Plain tiff alleges she did not receive.  (Id.) The City objects . In \nits Memorandum, the City explains that Workforce Director is a timekeeping and \nscheduling software used by the MPD . (Doc. 113 at 31). The City asks the Court to deny \nthis request on the grounds that it unduly burdens  a non -party to produce a  vast amount of \nconfidential and irrelevant data . (Id.)  \nThrough Request No. 22, Ms. Kasso seeks information related to MPD’s \n“Employee Intervention System,” including the identity of individuals related to CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 12 of 20 \n13 \n Plaintiff’s involvement in that program, and information about  whether the “Plaintiff was \nreferred to counseling or in house “police” counseling.” (Doc. 104 -3 at 14.) In arguing for \nthe relevance of this request, Ms. Kasso merely states that these records will be used \nduring trial. ( Id.) The City objects. It writes that Plaintiff erroneously identifies MPD’s \nEarly Intervention System, a non -disciplinary program that identifies and supports \nstruggling police officers. (Doc 113 at 36.) The City argues that Pl aintiff’s unrestricted \nrequest related to this program is overbroad, impinges on private personnel data, and \nunduly burdens a non -party. (Doc. 113 at 36.)  \nIn these requests, Ms. Kasso seeks  mere  needles  in haystack s of irrelevanc e. Ms. \nKasso’s request s seek reams of personal, often sensitive  details about  City employees \nwithout limitation. To the extent Ms. Kasso seeks  a sliver of relevant information  in each \nrequest , it is eclipsed  by the irrelevance of the information sought and outweighed by the \nburden of production on a non -party. Ms. Kasso’s Motion to Compel  is denied  as to \nRequest No s. 16 , 17, and 22 . \nH. Ms. Kasso ’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to  Request No. 18 . \nThrough th is request , Plaintiff seeks  her own personnel  and disciplinary files  in \nnative format . (Doc. 104 -3 at 11 .) Ms. Kasso does not explain how this request is relevant \nto her Title VII claim  against  Federation. The City objects  to this request,  and adds that it \nhas already produced this material in the parallel lawsuit. (Doc. 112 at 5.) \nA Rule 45 subpoena compels  the production of information to which a litigant does \nnot have access  in the interest of settling disputes . Rule 26 requires the Court to limit \ndiscovery if the  discovery sought is “unreasonably cumulative or duplicative. . .” Fed. R. CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 13 of 20 \n14 \n Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(C). Because Ms. Kasso is already in possession of her own personnel and \ndisciplinary files, then compelling the production of this discovery would be duplicative. \nSee also Minn. Stat. § 181.961 (setting forth state -law statutory basis for personnel records \nreview requests). Accordingly, Ms. Kasso’s Motion to Compel is denied as to Request \nNo. 18.  \nI. Ms. Kasso’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to Request No. 19 . \nPlaintiff’s next request is two -fold. First, Ms. Kasso  request s general contact \ninformation related to the Axon Body Camera Corporation “or any entity that provides \nbody camera services to the City of Minneapolis.” (Doc. 104 -3 at 12. ) Second, she \nrequest s body camera footage from May 20, 2018 , the date of her bicycle accident . (Id.) \nShe requests this information to refute claims regarding Plaintiff’s medical condition \nmade by the City officers . (Id.) The City objects. Among other reasons, the City represents \nto the Court that Ms. Kasso already possesses video footage of her bicycle accident such \nthat she need not compel it here. (Doc. 112 at 5.)  \nAs to Axon Body Camera ’s information , Ms. Kasso’s request is a  request for an \ninterrogatory beyond  Rule 45’s purview . Moreover, the information Ms. Kasso seeks is a \npublicly available  corporate address ; filing a motion to compel the City to provide that \ninformation does little beyond giving credence to the City’s complaint that Ms. Kasso has \nnot taken steps to avoid imposing undue burdens on this nonparty . Additionally,  her \nrequest for body camera footage is unnecessary.  As with Request No. 18, because Plai ntiff \nis already in possession of the body camera footage she requests, this request is denied.  \nAccordingly, Ms. Kasso’s Motion to Compel is denied as to Request No. 19 .  CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 14 of 20 \n15 \n J. Ms. Kasso ’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to  Request No. 21 . \nPlaintiff next requests contact details  for the City’s email and cellphone service \nproviders, including general corporate contact details. (Doc. 104 -3 at 14 .) She also \nrequests  all emails  and text messages “regarding the Plaintiff from any Federation \nRepresentative to any individual from January 1, 2016 , until May 20, 2020.” (Doc. 104 -3 \nat 14. ) Ms. Kasso makes no relevance showing for this request.  \nThe City objects . It argues first that this request is an interrogatory, and secondly \nthat it is irrelevant to Plaintiff’s claim against the Federation.  The City further objects that \nMs. Kasso’s requests for emails about herself on the grounds that this request  is overly \nbroad and unduly burdensome,  and would require the City to produce, review, and redact \nover a 1,000 emails . (Doc. 112 at 5.) The City then notes  that production of all text \nmessages related to Plaintiff would be overly burdensome because it would require the \nCity to obtain all phone numbers and email addresses used by the Federation over four \nyears . (Doc 114 at 35 -36.)  \nThe Court  denies this request.  The City correctly notes, and the Court agrees, that \ngeneral contact information of the City’s email and cellphone service provider s are \ninterrogatory requests beyond the ambit of Rule 45. While Ms. Kasso’s request s for emails  \nand text messages from Federation Representatives regarding herself are likely relevant, \nMs. Kasso bears the burden of proving  the relevance of the information she seeks. See \nSherman v. Sheffield Fin., LLC , 338 F.R.D. 247, 252 (D. Minn. 2021)  (“the party seeking \ndiscovery is required  to make a threshold showing of relevance before production of CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 15 of 20 \n16 \n information is required .”). Because Ms. Kasso  has made no showing of relevance , the \nCourt denies this request as written.  \nK. Ms. Kasso ’s Motion to Compel is Denied as to  Request No. 23 . \nPlaintiff’s final request seeks the production of “all ESI, documentation, notes \nreports, written information, medical  opinions and any communications has [sic] w ith \n“Risk Management, Occupational Health Consultants, and Health and Wellness.” (Doc. \n104-3 at 14 .) Ms. Kasso states merely that this information is relevant for use at trial. ( Id.)  \nThis request is denied. This request is so ambiguous as to be indecipherable . It appears \nto request vast stores of information with no showing of how the discovery  sought is \nrelevant to Ms. Kasso’s Title VII claim.   \nII. MS. KASSO’S OTHER REQUESTS FOR RELIEF ARE DENIED  IN THEIR \nENTIRETY .  \n \nAlong with her  enumerated requests for production, Ms. Kasso  asks this Court for \nthree further forms of relief. First,  she seeks a ruling that the City’s objections are waived \nfor untimely filing. (Doc. 103 at 3 .) Second, she  requests an award of reasonable costs and \nfees under Rule 37(a)(5).  (Id.) Lastly, she requests an adverse inference instruction for \nevidence allegedly withheld  by the City  in bad faith , any other relief the Court deems just \nand proper.  (Id.) The Court has already noted the basis of its denial of  Ms. Kasso’s first \nrequest for relief. For the following reasons , the Court denies Ms. Ka sso’s second and \nthird requests for relief.  \n  CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 16 of 20 \n17 \n A. Ms. Kasso is not entitled to Attorneys’ Fees  or Expenses .  \n \nMs. Kasso seeks fees and costs from the City. If a motion to compel is granted in \npart and denied in part, a court may “apportion the reasonable expenses for the motion.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(C). Based on the record before it, the Court concludes that \nexpenses are unwarranted . Although the Court grants Ms. Kasso’s Motion to Compel in \npart, the evidence of Plaintiff’s good faith efforts to obtain discovery before filing of her \nMotion are, at best, conflicting. ( See Doc. 112 at 1 -2; Doc. 114 at 4 -5.) Regardless, the \nCity’s objections to Ms. Kasso’s requests are substantially justified. The City is a non -\nparty to this action and Ms. Kasso’s requests have been far -reaching, largely irrelevant, \nand often  unduly  burdensome.  This is demonstrated by, among other things, the fact that \nMs. Kasso’s motion is granted with respect to a single request out of the 23 that are the \nsubject of her motion. Plaintiff is strongly encouraged to review Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 45(d)(1 ) and 37(a)(5)(C), which contemplate the payment of fees and \nexpenses —and apportionment of such payment —based on the merits of the motion. Here , \nthe Court will not order payment of expenses to Ms. Kasso.  \nB.  No Adverse Inference Instruction is Warranted.  \n  \nPlaintiff seeks an adverse inference instruction . An adverse inference instruction is \nan extreme measure to penalize and deter failures to properly preserve ESI. Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 37, subdiv. (e)(2).  Only when a party acts “with intent to deprive another party of the \ninformation’s use in the litigation” may  the Court instruct the jury at trial that such \nevidence would be unfavorable to the party responsible for the loss. Id. Not only is there \nzero evidence the City intended to deprive Ms. Kasso of the requested information’s use, CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 17 of 20 \n18 \n but also, despite Ms. Kasso’s repeated assertions otherwise, the  City is not  a party to this \nlitigation . Therefore,  an adverse instruction against the City  as a non -party makes no \nsense .  \nIII. PLAINTIFF’S CITATIONS VIOLATE RULE 11.  \n \nFinally , the Court must address Plaintiff’s use of inaccurate and nonexistent \ncaselaw consistent with irresponsible use of AI. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 \nimposes a “personal, nondelegable responsibility” to “validate the truth and legal \nreasonableness of the papers filed” in an action. Pavelic  & LeFlore  v. Marvel  Ent. Grp., \n493 U.S. 120, 126 –27 (1989).  Federal courts throughout the country have reiterated the \nsame: the use of nonexistent caselaw generated by AI represents an abdication of the duty \nof truthfulness and  an abuse of the legal system . Kohls  v. Ellison , No. 24 -CV-3754 \n(LMP/DLM), 2025 WL 66514, at *4 (D. Minn. Jan. 10, 2025 ) (describing how AI -\ngenerated sources in a declaration “shatters [the declarant’s]  credibility with this Court” ); \nMata v. Avianca , Inc. 678 F. Supp.  3d 443, 461  (S.D.N.Y. 2023) (“An attempt to persuade \na court or oppose an adversary by relying on fake opinions is an abuse of the adversary \nsystem .”). Beyond  plain violation of Rule 11 , the harms of citations to fake AI -caselaw \ninclude sullying the reputation of the judiciary, wasting time, and denigrating  the \notherwise  valid claims of litigants. See Morgan  v. Cmty.  Against  Violence , No. 23-cv-353-\nWPJ/JMR,  2023  WL 6976510,  at *8 (D.N.M.  Oct. 23, 2023) .   \nMs. Kasso’s use of fictitious and non -existent caselaw violates  under Rule 11. Ms. \nKasso has repeatedly cited to caselaw that does not exist. (See Doc. 103 at 2  (citing to \nKlingenstein v. Pettit , 297 F. Supp. 2d 435, 439 (S.D.N.Y 2003) which does not exist) , 3, CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 18 of 20 \n19 \n (citing  to In re Application of Time, Inc ., 1999 WL 804090, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 6, 1999) \nbut In re Application of Time, Inc . is a case from the Eastern District of Louisiana, and the \nquoted language appears nowhere in the case) ; Doc 105 at 2 , (citing Miller v. Pruneda , \n236 F.R.D. 277, 282 (N.D. Tex. 2006) but Miller  is a 2004 case from the Northern District \nof West Virginia, and does not support Ms. Kasso’s proposition. ) She has also often cited \nto real cases for propositions  for which they clearly do not stand.  (See Doc. 105 at 2 -3 \n(citing to Martindell v. Int’l Tel. & Tel. Corp.,  594 F.2d 291, 295 (2d Cir. 1979); Andritz \nSprout -Bauer, Inc., v. Beazer East, Inc. , 174 F.R.D. 609, 631 (M.D. Pa. 1997) ; Doc. 102 \nat 3.) In doing so, Ms. Kasso has abdicated her dut y of truthfulness  to the Court under \nRule 11 , wasted time and resources, and jeopardized the integrity of her own  claim s and \nthe success of her suit. The Court acknowledges the utility of AI to the pro se litigant , \nespecially faced with  steep barriers to access legal education and resources. But pro se \nlitigants , including  Ms. Kasso , are not exempt from  following the  substantive and \nprocedural requirements of the law. Burgs v. Sissel , 745 F.2d 526, 528 (8th Cir. 1984) \n(“Although pro se pleadings are to be construed liberally, pro se litigants are not excused \nfrom failing to comply with substantive and procedural law.”) . Liberal  construction does \nnot mean anything goes.  And Ms. Kasso’s pro se status will not  protect her from th e “steep \nconsequences” that courts across the country have imposed for the use of fake, AI -\ngenerated sources . Park  v. Kim, 91 F.4th 610, 615 (2d Cir. 2024)  (referring attorney for \npotential discipline for use of fake, AI -generated citations in a filing ); see also Kohls  v. \nEllison  X Mata  v. Avianca,  Inc., 678 F. Supp. 3d 443, 466 (S.D.N.Y. 2023) (sanctioning \nattorney for including fake, AI-generated  legal citations in a filing) ; Kruse  v. Karlan , 692 CASE 0:23-cv-02777-KMM-DLM     Doc. 145     Filed 10/21/25     Page 19 of 20 \n20 \n S.W.3d 43, 53 (Mo. Ct. App. 2024) (dismissing appeal based on litigant ’s use of fake, AI -\ngenerated legal citations).  The Court thus  warns  Plaintiff that further use of fictitious and \ninaccurate  authorities will not be tolerated . \nORDER  \nAccordingly, based on the above and on all the files, records, and proceedings in \nthis action, IT IS ORDERED that: \n1. Plaintiff  Leila Kasso’s  Second Motion to Compel Rule 45 Subpoena  (Doc. 1 03) is \nGRANTED  IN PART  and DENIED IN PART . \n \na. Ms. Kasso’s Motion to Compel is GRANTED as to Request No. 10.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Matthew Lazares v. Shopify (USA), Inc., the court granted Shopify's motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing Lazares' claim under the California Unlawful Competition Law (UCL). Lazares alleged that Shopify misclassified employees and did not adequately pay overtime, among other labor violations. Shopify’s motion was granted because Lazares failed to demonstrate the lack of an adequate legal remedy and standing to pursue equitable relief. There is no involvement of AI, ML, or automated systems in the facts, claims, or holding of the case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff, Matthew Lazares, had sufficiently alleged a lack of an adequate legal remedy and standing to seek equitable relief under the California Unlawful Competition Law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Lazares failed to fix the deficiencies noted in his previous complaint; specifically, he did not demonstrate a lack of adequate legal remedies or standing to seek equitable relief under the UCL. Therefore, the court granted Shopify’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing the UCL claim without leave to amend.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: In simple terms, Matthew Lazares was upset with Shopify because he and others weren’t paid enough for overtime and other work conditions. He tried to sue Shopify based on a special California law, but the court said he hadn't shown why he needed equity (a fair outcome when basic laws don’t cover it) instead of just using the normal law remedies. Basically, he didn't prove that there wasn't another way to fix his problem using existing laws, so the court threw out his special claim.",

No. 29 \n \n \nPending before the Court is Defendant Shopify (USA) Inc.’s second motion for judgment \non the pleadings.  Dkt. No. 29.  The Court finds this matter appropriate for disposition without oral \nargument and the matter is deemed submitted.  See Civil L.R. 7 -1(b).  For the reasons detailed \nbelow, the Court GRANTS the motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff Matthew Laz ares initially filed this putative class action in the Superior Court of \nSan Mateo.  See Dkt. No. 1 at ¶  1.  The Court previously granted Defendant’s motion for judgment \non the pleadings, Dkt. No. 22, and Plaintiff filed a second amended complaint.  Dkt. No. 23 \n(“SAC”).  The factual allegations are largely unchanged.  \nPlaintiff alleges as before that Defendant misclassified him and other commissioned sales \nemployees as “exempt,” in violation of California law.  See id. at ¶¶ 23–34.  As a result, Plaintiff \nasserts that they were not properly paid for overtime or sick time, did not receive proper meal and \nrest breaks due to their work obligations, were regularly forced to work seven consecutive days \nwithout a day off, and were not timely paid.  See id.  at ¶¶ 35–51, 89–100.  Plaintiff also alleges \nthat Defendant would frequ ently alter the Commission Plans,  which include sales quotas for \ncommissioned employees, without the agreement of or notice to the affected employees.  See id.  at Case 4:24-cv-07125-HSG     Document 37     Filed 05/14/25     Page 1 of 9 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ¶¶ 52–57.  These employees, therefore, could not effectively calculate their commissions or track \ntheir progress toward sales targets.  See id.  at ¶ 57.  Plaintiff also identifies several aspects of the \nCommission Plans and other written agreements that he says are unlawful.  See, e.g. , id. at ¶¶  58–\n88.  For example, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant required him and other putative class members \nto sign unlawful confidentiality and non -compete agreements.  Id. \nBased on these allegations, Plaintiff brings several causes of action for violations of the \nCalifornia Labor Code and California Wage Orders, and as relevant here, violations of the \nCalifornia Unlawful Competition Law, Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200, et seq.  (“UCL”) .  See id.  \nat ¶¶ 111–233.  Defendant once again has moved for judgment on the pleadings as to  Plaintiff’s \nUCL claim  and request s for equitable relief .  Dkt. No. 29. \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n“After the pleadings are closed —but early enough not to delay trial —a party may move for \njudgment on the pleadings.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).  Granting a judgment on the pleadings is \nproper when, “taking all the allegations in the pleadings as true, the mov ing party is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.”  Gregg v. Haw., Dep’t of Pub. Safety , 870 F.3d 883, 887 (9th Cir. \n2017) (quoting Nelson v. City of Irvine , 143 F.3d 1196, 1200 (9th Cir. 1998)).  “Because a Rule \n12(c) motion is functionally identical to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the same standard of review \napplies to motions brought under either rule.”  Id. (quoting Cafasso v. Gen. Dynamics C4 Sys., \nInc., 637 F.3d 1047, 1054, n.4 (9th Cir. 2011) ) (quotation omitted).  \n“Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where the complaint lacks a cognizable \nlegal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory.”  Mendiondo v. Centinela \nHosp. Med. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008); see also  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (requiring that \na complaint contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to \nrelief”).  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff must plead “enough facts to state a claim to \nrelief that i s plausi ble on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim \nis facially plausible when a plaintiff pleads “factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  In reviewing the plausibility of a complaint, courts “accept factual Case 4:24-cv-07125-HSG     Document 37     Filed 05/14/25     Page 2 of 9 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the \nnonmoving party.”  Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. , 519 F.3d 1025, 1031 (9th Cir. \n2008).  Nonetheless, courts do not “accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, \nunwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 \nF.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nThe Court previously dismissed Plaintiff’s UCL claim under Rule 12(c) , finding that \nPlaintiff  had failed to allege that he lacked adequate legal remedies and had failed to allege that he \nhad standing to pursue equitable relief.  See Dkt. No. 22.  Defendant argues that Plaintiff has failed \nto remedy these deficiencies, and the Court agrees.  \nA. Equitable Jurisdiction  \nDefendant  first argues that Plaintiff cannot seek equitable relief under the UCL because he \nhas failed to allege that he lacks an adequate remedy at law.  See Dkt. No. 29 at 5–9.  “In order to \nentertain a request for equitable relief, a district court must have equitable jurisdiction, which can \nonly exist under federal common law if the plaintiff has no adequate legal remedy.”   Guzman v. \nPolaris Indus. , 49 F.4th 1308, 1313 (9th Cir. 2022).  \nIn the SAC, Plaintiff seeks “equitable restitutionary damages” and “disgorgement of \nprofits” based on Defendant’s alleged violations of California labor laws .  See SAC at ¶¶  189–203, \n214, Prayer for Relief at p p.43–44.  Plaintiff urges that, although his UCL claim is premised on \nlabor law violations , he nevertheless lacks an adequate remedy at law because the California \nLabor Code only has a three -year statute of limitations  whereas the UCL has a four -year statute of \nlimitations .  See id.  at ¶¶ 189–197; see also Dkt. No. 35 at 2, 5–8.  In other words, Plaintiff  asserts \nthat he  lacks an adequate remedy of law as to the additional  fourth year for which damages are \nunavailable under the Labor Code’s statute of limitations.   Id. \nThe Ninth Circuit has previously rejected reliance on a statute of limitations as a basis for \nconsidering  legal relief inadequate.  See Guzman , 49 F.4th at 1312.   In Guzman , the Court \nexplained  that “equitable relief must be withheld when an equivalent legal claim would have been \navailable but for a time bar .”  Id.  The Court considered whether a plaintiff could bring a UCL Case 4:24-cv-07125-HSG     Document 37     Filed 05/14/25     Page 3 of 9 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  claim in federal court when  his California Consumers Legal Remedies Act  (“CLRA”)  claim , based \non the same conduct,  had been dismissed as  time barred .  Id. at 1311 –12.  The Court reasoned that \nthe plaintiff had an adequate legal remedy in the time -barred CLRA claim.  Id.  The Ninth Circuit \nexplained that the  “failure to have timely pursued [a legal] claim cannot confer equitable \njurisdiction on a federal court to entertain [a] UCL claim.”   Id. at 1312.  \nRelying on such reasoning, c ourts in this district have rejected the same argument that \nPlaintiff makes  here.  See, e.g., Cook v. Matrix Absence Mgmt., Inc. , 737 F. Supp. 3d 885, 892 \n(N.D. Cal. 2024) ; Mish v. TForce Freight, Inc. , No. 21 -CV-04094 -EMC, 2021 WL 4592124, at *7 \n(N.D. Cal. Oct. 6, 2021) ; Hassell v. Uber Techs., Inc. , No. 20 -CV-04062 -PJH, 2021 WL 2531076, \nat *21 (N.D. Cal. June 21, 2021) .  The Court finds the reasoning of these cases persuasive and \nadopts it here.   “[T]he fact that the statute of limitations has now lapsed [as to this fourth year] \ndoes not, on its own, render the more limited legal remedies now available to [him]  inadequate. ”  \nCook , 737 F. Supp. 3d at 893.  \nPlaintiff  has failed to identify any binding authority to support his assertion  that he lacks \nadequate remedies at law based solely on a  difference  in the statute of limitations applicable to  a \ndirect Labor Code claim and a UCL claim based  on Labor Code violation s.  Plaintiff relies heavily \non two state court cases that predate Guzman .  See Cortez v. Purolator Air Filtration Prods. Co. , \n23 Cal. 4th 163 (Cal. 2000), and Aryeh v. Canon Business Solutions, Inc. , 55 Cal. 4th 1185 (Cal. \n2013).   But even if Calif ornia courts permit plaintiffs to use the  UCL to bridge the gap in statutes \nof limitations, that is not germane to  the Court’s equitable jurisdiction  here.  As the Ninth Circuit \nexplained in Guzman , “even if the relevant state court would allow the equitable  claims to \nproceed, the federal court must apply federal principles governing equity jurisdiction.”   Guzman , \n49 F.4th at 1312 ( citing Sonner v. Premier Nutrition Corp. , 971 F.3d 834, 8 41–44 (9th Cir. 2020) ). \nNotably , the only federal  cases that Plaintiff has identified do not appear to  support his \nargument  either : \n \n• Plaintiff purportedly quotes  Zeiger v. WellPet LLC , 526 F. Supp. 3d 652, 687 (N.D. Case 4:24-cv-07125-HSG     Document 37     Filed 05/14/25     Page 4 of 9 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Cal. 2021),1 but the quoted language  does not appear in Zeiger at all.  Moreover, the \ncase does not address the question of whether equitable relief is available, or legal \nremedies are considered inadequate for purposes of equitable jurisdiction, for conduct \nfalling outside the statute of limitations.  Rather , the court in Zeiger acknowledged that \nequitable restitution may sometimes be barred where “equitable restitution [] seek[s] to \ncompensate a plaintiff for the same past harm as monetary damages .”  Id. \n \n• Plaintiff cites Roper v. Big Heart Pet Brands, Inc. , 510 F. Supp. 3d 903, 918 –19 (E.D. \nCal. 2020) , indicating that the court  “den[ied a] motion to dismiss [a] UCL claim \nwhere [the] legal claim was barred by time and UCL provided the only available \nremedy.”   Dkt. No. 35 at 7 .  But here too, the case did not address whether legal \nremedies are inadequate for purposes of equitable jurisdiction based on a statute of \nlimitations.   The court simply concluded that  equitable relief was available to address \nalleged future harm.  Id. \n \n• Plaintiff cites “ Adkins v. Comcast Corp. , 2021 WL 4451451, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 29, \n2021).”  See Dkt. No. 35 at 7, 17.  But this Westlaw citation is for an unrelated  state \ncriminal case, entitled People v. Escobar , 2021 WL 4451451 (Cal. Ct. App. Sept. 29, \n2021).    \n \n• Plaintiff similarly cites “Wilcox v. Harbor UCLA Med. Ctr. Guild , No. 2:23 -cv-02802 -\nMCS -JC, 2023 WL 8359623, at *4 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2023).”  Dkt. No. 35 at 1.  But \nthis Westlaw  citation is for an unrelated New Jersey state court case, entitled 257-261 \n20th Ave. Realty, LLC v. Roberto , 477 N.J. Super. 339, 349 (App. Div. 2023), aff’d as \nmodified , 259 N.J. 417 (2025).  The Court also reviewed the Wilcox docket in PACER, \n \n1 Plaintiff attributes the following quotation to Zeiger :  “Sonner  does not prohibit the assertion of \nequitable claims where legal remedies are genuinely unavailable, such as when statutes of \nlimitation have run.”   Dkt. No. 35 at 7.  Case 4:24-cv-07125-HSG     Document 37     Filed 05/14/25     Page 5 of 9 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  and no order appears to have been filed on November 28, 2023.  Elsewhere in the \nopposition  brief , Plaintiff provides two other  Westlaw citation s for Wilcox .  See Dkt. \nNo. 35 at 5, 13.  B ut these  citation s are also wrong : one  is a New York state court reply \nbrief  and the other does not  appear related to any case.  \n \nIn short, Plaintiff offers no legal support for his argument that his legal remedies should be \nconsidered inadequate simply because  the statute of limitations under the Labor Code is shorter \nthan the statute of limitations under the UCL 2 \nPlaintiff also argues that he lacks adequate legal remedies to the extent his UCL claim is \npremised on alleged violations of California Business & Professions Code §  16600.1.  See Dkt. \nNo. 35 at 8 –12; see also  SAC at ¶¶ 72 –83, 99 –100.  Plaintiff alleges that Defendant failed to \nprovide him with notice that its non -compete agreements are void , as required under §  16600.1 .  \nSee id.  Plaintiff points out that §  16600.1 explicitly states that “[a] violation of this section \nconstitutes an act of unfair competiti on.”  Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600.1(c).  Relying on this \nlanguage, Plaintiff appears to suggest that he does not have adequate legal remedies because the \nstatute itself assumes that plaintiffs will bring a UCL claim to enforce their statutory rights.  See \nDkt. No. 35 at 8–12. \nBut Plaintiff ’s argument  misses  the mark.  As Defendant points out, a plaintiff “ may bring \na private action to enforce this chapter [which includes § 16600.1 ,] for injunctive relief or the \nrecovery of actual damages , or both. ”  Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600.5(e)(1) (emphasis added).  \nAlthough Plaintiff may not be seeking actual damages under §  16600.5(e)(1), see Dkt. No. 35 at \n11, such relief is still statutorily available to him.  See McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. New York State \n \n2 The Court has serious concerns that several of Plaintiff’s authorities are miscited or misquoted.  \nAs detailed above, this does not appear to be an isolated clerical mistake.  Moreover, counsel \nappears to have filed inaccurate citations in other cases in this district.  Judge Orrick recently \nrequired counsel to explain how false quotations ended up in their opposition to a motion to \ndismiss in Moons v. WalkMe, Inc., a Delaware corporation , Case No. 24 -cv-07798 -WHO, Dkt. \nNo. 44.  The Court therefore ORDERS  Plaintiff’s counsel to SHOW CAUSE  why they should \nnot be sanctioned for  providing inaccurate citations in their opposition brief.  Counsel shall also \nindicate whether they used generative artificial intelligence to draft the opposition brief in whole \nor in part.   Counsel shall file a statement of five pages or less by May 23 , 2025.  Case 4:24-cv-07125-HSG     Document 37     Filed 05/14/25     Page 6 of 9 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Common Ret. Fund, Inc. , 339 F.3d 1087, 1093 (9th Cir. 2003) (“Whether [a plaintiff] chooses to \npursue [legal] remedies  . . . does not alter the availability of the remedies at law.”) .  And critically, \nPlaintiff  does not explain why such legal remedies —actual damages —are inadequate  here to \naddress any failure to provide him the required notice .  To the extent Plaintiff suggests that there is \nsome ongoing or future harm for which an injunction is needed, see Dkt. No. 35 at 10, the Court \naddresses this in Section III.B below.  \nB. Standing  \nSetting aside his request for restitution and disgorgement of profits, Plaintiff also argues \nthat he can still seek injunctive relief under the UCL to prevent Defendant from continuing its \nallegedly illegal practices.  See Dkt. No. 35 at 1 –4, 10, 14–15; see SAC at ¶¶  196, 206, 213; see \nalso Prayer for Relief at p p.43–44.  Plaintiff urges that legal remedies are inadequate to protect \nhim—and others —from Defendant’s ongoing conduct.  See Dkt. No. 35 at 3 –4.  Defendant  argues, \nhowever, that Plaintiff still lac ks standing to seek such relief.  See Dkt. No. 29 at 9 –11.  The Court \nagrees.  \nTo establish standing under Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff must allege an “injury \nin fact,” which is concrete and particularized, and neither conjectural nor hypothetical.  See Lujan \nv. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992).  Additionally, to have standing to seek prospective \ninjunctive relief, a plaintiff must “demonstrate a real and immediate threat of repeated injury in the \nfuture.”  Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc. , 631 F.3d 939, 946 (9th Cir. 2011) (quotation \nomitted ). \nAs before,  Plaintiff has not alleged how he , as a former employee,  personally is at risk of \nany future injury .  Plaintiff does not allege that Defendant has enforced, attempted to enforce, or \nwill attempt to enforce any aspect of the  allegedly unlawful  agreements against him.   Nor has he \nalleged that he somehow altered his behavior as a result of these agreements.   Plaintiff claims that \nhe has alleged a credible risk of future harm because he suffered “restrictions on his ability to \npursue work, communicate with former colleagues, and protect his own creative output.” Dkt. No. \n35 at 15.  But none of these allegations  are in the SAC.  Plaintiff  also asserts that he “is not \nrequired to wait for Shopify to bring an enforcement action against him before seeking relief.”  Case 4:24-cv-07125-HSG     Document 37     Filed 05/14/25     Page 7 of 98 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  See id.  But Plaintiff’s own case indicates that “pre -enforcement review” is permissible for \npurposes of  Article III only “under circumstances that render the threatened enforcement \nsufficiently imminent.”  See Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S. 149, 159 (2014).  \nPlaintiff has failed to explain the imminency  of any enforcement of the agreements against him.  \nIn addition to the requirements of Article III standing, the UCL has additional standing \nrequirements that require a plaintiff to (1) plead an economic injury and (2) show that the injury \nwas caused by the challenged conduct.  See Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court , 51 Cal. 4th 310, 322 \n(Cal. 2011).  Here, Plaintiff does not allege how he suffered any economic injury due to \nDefendant’s allegedly unlawful agreements .  Plaintiff states that he “received an exit letter \naffirming that the unlawful provisions [of t he agreements] remain in effect.”  See Dkt. No. 35 at 15 \n(citing SAC ¶¶  70–71).  But he has not alleged how he has suffered any economic injury as a \nresult of the agreements or this exit letter.  \nIV. CONCLUSION\nThe Court GRANTS  the motion for judgment on the pleadings.  Dkt. No. 29.  As with a\nRule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court granting judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) \nshould grant leave to amend even if no request for leave to amend has been made, unless it is clear \nthat amendment would be futile.  See Pac. W. Grp., Inc. v. Real Time Solutions, Inc. , 321 Fed. \nApp’x 566, 569 (9th Cir. 2008).  The Court find s, however,  that further leave to amend would be \nfutile.  See Zucco Partners, LLC v. Digimarc  Corp. , 552 F.3d 981, 1007 (9th Cir. 2009) (“[W]here \nthe Plaintiff has previously been granted leave to amend and has subsequently failed to add the \nrequisite particularity to its claims, [t]he district court’s discretion to deny leave to amend is \nparticularly broad.” (quotation omitted)).   The Court already gave Plaintiff an opportunity to \namend, and cautioned him to “fully plead his best case.”  See Dkt. No. 22 at 6.  Although Plaintiff \nasks for an other  opportunity to amend, see Dkt. No. 35 at 16, he offers no explanation of what \nnew allegations he would plead to support his UCL claim .  The Court therefore DISMISSES  the \nUCL claim without leave to amend and without prejudice to refiling in state court, as Guzman  \ninstructs.  See 49 F.4th at 1314 –15.  The scheduling order, Dkt. No. 34, remains in effect.  \nThe Court further DIRECTS  Plaintiff’s counsel to file their response  to the order to show Case 4:24-cv-07125-HSG     Document 37     Filed 05/14/25     Page 8 of 99 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  cause  by May 23, 2025 , as discussed in footnote 2 above . \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  \n______________________________________  \nHAYWOOD S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves Henry Verne Thompson's appeal against the Social Security Administration's (SSA) denial of his disability benefits claim. The court upheld the decision of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), finding no error in the ALJ's evaluation of medical evidence, mental impairments, or the suitability of the jobs presented for Thompson's capabilities. Notably, the court granted Thompson's motion to strike certain portions of his opening brief due to issues involving errors akin to AI-generated inaccuracies in legal citations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the ALJ erred in evaluating Thompson's mental limitations, RFC assessment without medical opinion, and step-five job suitability related to his physical limitations, as well as the implications of AI-related errors in the opening brief.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court affirmed the ALJ's decision, finding it supported by substantial evidence. The court held that the ALJ properly evaluated evidence related to Thompson's impairments using available medical records, did not err in the RFC assessment, and there was no conflict between Thompson's limitations and the jobs identified. Additionally, the court acknowledged and corrected AI-related citation errors in Thompson's legal filings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Henry Thompson wanted disability benefits but was denied, so he took it to court. The judge looked at whether mistakes were made in deciding if Henry was really too disabled to work. The judge found everything was done correctly, including the listing of jobs Henry could still do despite his problems. Henry’s lawyer also used a computer program that made some mistakes with legal stuff in their paperwork, so those parts were crossed out. In the end, the judge agreed with the initial decision to deny benefits.",

No. CV-25-00365 -PHX -JAT \n \nORDER  \n \n  \nPending before the Court is Plaintiff ’s Motion for Extension of Time , (Doc. 16) , \nPlaintiff ’s Motion to Strike or Amend Opening Brief , (Doc. 18) , and Plaintiff ’s Social \nSecurity appeal , (Doc. 1) . The Court will address each in turn.   \nI. MOTION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME  \nPlaintiff filed a Motion for an Extension of Time  wherein he requests a 14 -day \nextension  to file his Reply brief. (Doc. 16). Plaintiff correctly notes that the Reply was due \non August 14, 202 5. (Doc. 16 at 1). Plaintiff submitted his Reply on August 14, 202 5. (See \nDoc. 17). The Court will therefore deny Plaintiff ’s Motion for an Extension of Time as \nmoot.  \nII. MOTION TO STRIKE OR AMEND  \nPlaintiff filed a Motion to Strike or Amend wherein he asks the Court  to permit  him \nto strike portions of his Opening Brief. (Doc. 18).   In part, Plaintiff filed this Motion to \naddress “concerns raised by Defendant regarding certain citations. ” (Doc. 18 at 1). Those \nconcerns were that Plaintiff (1) included a non -existent quotation from a n existing  case, (2) Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 1 of 14 \n- 2 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n mischaracterized a proposition from a n existing  case, (3) cited a non -existent case, and (4) \nmiscited a case that did not address the asserted issue. ( See Doc. 18 at 2). The Court notes \nthat Plaintiff ’s counsel, Maren Bam, was recently  sanctioned for submitting an Opening \nBrief in a separate Social Security case that “was replete with citation -related deficiencies, \nincluding those consistent with artificial intelligence generated hallucinations. ”1 (2:25-cv-\n00689 -KML -ASB Doc. 18 at 1). The Court will grant Plaintiff ’s Motion to Strike; the \nidentified portions are deemed to be stri cken. \nIII. SOCIAL SECURITY APPEAL  \nAlso p ending before the Court is Plaintiff ’s appeal from the Commission of the \nSocial Security Administration ’s (“SSA, ” “Commissioner, ” or “Defendant ”) denial of \nSocial Security benefits . (Doc. 7 -3). The Court has reviewed Plaintiff ’s Opening Brief, \n(Doc. 11), Defendant ’s Response, (Doc. 1 5), and Plaintiff ’s Reply, (Doc. 1 7).  \na. Factual and Procedural Overview  \nPlaintiff is currently 54 years old2 with “at least [a] high school education and past \nwork experience as [a] house repairer and [an] automobile mechanic. ” (Doc. 11 at 3 –4). \nPlaintiff filed his Social Security Disability Insurance ( “SSDI ”) benefits application on  \nMarch 7, 2022 , alleging disabilities beginning on November 3, 2020 . (Doc. 10 -2 at 22).  \nThe application was “denied initially on September 21, 2022, and upon reconsideration on \nDecember 12, 2023. ” (Id.). After an administrative hearing, an ALJ denied Plaintiff ’s \nclaim. ( Id. at 19 ). The SSA Appeals Council denied a request for review of that decision \nand adopted the ALJ ’s decision as the agency ’s final decision. ( Id. at 2–4).  \nb. SSA’s Five -Step Evaluation Process  \nTo qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits, a claimant must show \nthat he “is under a disability. ” 42 U.S.C. § 423(a)(1)(E). To be “under a disability, ” the \nclaimant must be unable to engage in “substantial gainful activity ” due to any medically \ndeterminable physical or mental impairment. Id. § 423(d)(1). The impairment must be of \n \n1 The Commissioner  also flagged this case in its Response, (Doc. 19  at 2).  \n2 Plaintiff was 49 on the alleged disability onset date , which matters because he changed \nage categories once he turned 50 . (Doc. 11 at 3 –4). Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 2 of 14 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n such severity that the claimant cannot do his previous work or any other substantial gainful \nwork within the national economy. Id. § 423(d)(2). The SSA has created a five -step \nsequential evaluation process for determining whether an individual is disabled. See 20 \nC.F.R. § 404.1520(a)(1). The steps are followed in order, and each step is potentially \ndispositive. See id.  § 404.1520(a)(4).  \nAt Step One, the ALJ determines whether the claimant is engaging in “substantial \ngainful activity. ” Id. § 404.1520(a)(4)(i). “Substantial gainful activity ” is work activity that \nis (1) “substantial, ” i.e., doing “significant physical or mental activities; ” and (2) “gainful, ” \ni.e., usually done “for pay or profit. ” 20 C.F.R. § 416.972(a) -(b). If the claimant is engaging \nin substantial gainful work activity, the ALJ will find the claimant is not disabled. Id. § \n404.1520(a)(4)(i).  \nAt Step Two, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has “a severe medically \ndeterminable physical or mental impairment ” or severe “combination of impairments. ” Id. \n§ 404.1520(a)(4)(ii). To be “severe, ” the claimant ’s impairment must “significantly limit ” \nthe claimant ’s “physical or mental ability to do basic work activities. ” Id. § 404.1520(c). \nIf the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the ALJ \nwill find the claimant is not disabled. Id. § 404.1520(a)(4)(ii).  \nAt Step Three, the ALJ determines whether the claimant ’s impairment(s) “meets or \nequals ” an impairment listed in Appendix 1 to Subpart P of 20 C.F.R. Part 404. Id. § \n404.1520(a)(4)(iii). If so, the ALJ will find the claimant is disabled, but if not, the ALJ \nmust assess the claimant ’s “residual functional capacity ” (“RFC ”) before proceeding to \nStep Four. Id. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(iii), 404.1520(e). The claimant ’s RFC is his ability \nperform physical and mental work activities “despite his limitations, ” based on a ll relevant \nevidence in the case record. Id. § 404.1545(a)(1). To determine RFC, the ALJ must \nconsider all the claimant ’s impairments, including those that are not “severe, ” and any \nrelated symptoms that “affect what [the claimant] can do in a work setting. ” Id. §§ \n404.1545(a)(1) -(2). \nAt Step Four, the ALJ determines whether the claimant has the RFC to perform the Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 3 of 14 \n- 4 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n physical and mental demands of “his past relevant work. ” Id. §§ 404.1520(a)(4)(iv), \n404.1520(e). “Past relevant work ” is work the claimant has “done within the past 15 years, \nthat was substantial gainful activity. ” Id. § 404.1560(b)(1). If the claimant has the RFC to \nperform his past relevant work, the ALJ will find the claimant is not disabled. Id. § \n404.1520(a)(4)(iv). If the claimant cannot perform his past relevant work, the ALJ will \nproceed to Step Five in the sequential evaluation process.  \nAt Step Five, the final step, the ALJ considers whether the claimant “can make an \nadjustment to other work, ” considering his RFC, age, education, and work experience. Id. \n§ 404.1520(a)(v). If so, the ALJ will find the claimant not disabled. Id. If the claimant \ncannot make this adjustment, the ALJ will find the opposite. Id. \nc. ALJ’s Five-Step Analysis  \nHere, at Step One, the ALJ concluded that the record established that although  \nPlaintiff “engaged in substantial gainful activity from [November 3, 2020] through \nNovember 2021, ” there was a continuous 12 -month period during which he did not engage \nin such activity. (Doc. 10 -2 at 25).  The ALJ ’s findings address the period during which \nPlaintiff did not engage in substantial gainful activity. ( Id.).  \nAt Step Two, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff “has the following severe \nimpairments: degenerative disc disease of the cervical and lumbar spine .” (Id.).  \nAt Step Three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff “does not have an impairment or \ncombination of impairments that meets or medically equals the severity of one of the listed \nimpairments ” in Appendix 1 to Subpart P of 20 C.F.R. Part 404. ( Id. at 27).  Subsequently, \nthe ALJ determined that Plaintiff had the RFC to:  \n \nperform a range of light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) \nspecifically as follows: lift and/or carry 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds \nfrequently; stand and/or walk for six hours out of an eight -hour workday with \nregular breaks; sit for six hours out of an eight -hour workday with regular breaks; \nfrequently push and/or pull within the weight limits indicated for lifting and \ncarrying; frequently perform fingering with the bilateral upper extremities; \noccasionall y climb ramps and stairs; never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds; \noccasionally balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, and crawl; and avoid concentrated \nexposure to hazards, such as heavy moving machinery and unprotected heights.  \n(Id. at 28).  Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 4 of 14 \n- 5 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n At Step Four, the ALJ concluded  that Plaintiff “is unable to perform any past \nrelevant work .” (Id. at 31).  \nAt Step Five, the ALJ, considering Plaintiff ’s age, education, work experience, and \nRFC, found that “there are jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy \nthat the claimant can perform .” (Id. at 32). Examples of such jobs include  marker, \nhousekeeper cleaner, and cafeteria attendant. ( Id. at 33). Accordingly, the ALJ concluded \nthat Plaintiff “has not been under a disability, as defined in the Social Security Act, from \nNovember 3, 2020, through [September 13, 2024]. ” (Id.). \nd. Appellate  Legal  Standard  \nThis Court may not set aside a final denial of disability benefits unless the ALJ \ndecision is “based on legal error or not supported by substantial evidence in the record. ” \nRevels v. Berryhill , 874 F.3d 648, 654 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Benton ex rel. Benton v. \nBarnhart , 331 F.3d 1030, 1035 (9th Cir. 2003)). “Substantial ” evidence involves “more \nthan a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance. ” Thomas v. Barnhart , 278 F.3d 947, \n954 (9th Cir. 2002). Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that “a reaso nable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion. ” Id. (quoting Desrosiers v. Sec ’y of \nHealth & Human Servs. , 846 F.2d 573, 576 (9th Cir. 1988)). The Court, in its review, must \nconsider the record in its entirety, “weighing both the evidence that supports and evidence \nthat detracts from the [ALJ ’s] conclusion. ” Id. (quoting Garrison v. Colvin , 759 F.3d 995, \n1009 (9th Cir. 2007)).  \nThe ALJ —not this Court —is responsible for resolving ambiguities, resolving \nconflicts in medical testimony, determining credibility, and drawing logical inferences \nfrom the medical record. See Andrews v. Shalala , 53 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir. 1995) (citing \nMagallanes v. Bowen , 881 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir. 1989); Gallant v. Heckler , 753 F.2d \n1450, 1453 (9th Cir. 1984)). Therefore, when the evidence of record could result in more \nthan one rational interpretation, “the ALJ ’s decision should be upheld. ” Orn v. Ast rue, 495 \nF.3d 625, 630 (9th Cir. 2007); Batson v. Comm ’r of Soc. Sec. Admin. , 359 F.3d 1190, 1198 \n(9th Cir. 2004) ( “When the evidence before the ALJ is subject to more than one rational Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 5 of 14 \n- 6 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n interpretation, [the Court] must defer to the ALJ ’s conclusion. ”). Further, this Court may \nonly review the reasons the ALJ provides in the disability determination; it “may not affirm \nthe ALJ on a ground upon which he did not rely. ” Garrison , 759 F.3d at 1010. The Court \nwill not reverse the Commissioner ’s decision if it is based on harmless error, which exists \nif the error is “‘inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination, ’ or if, despite \nthe legal error, ‘the agency ’s path may reasonably be discerned  . . .’” Brown -Hunter v. \nColvin , 806 F.3d 487, 492 (9th Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  \ne. Analysis  \nPlaintiff appeals the SSA ’s denial of Social Security benefits, arguing that “the ALJ \nerred by: (1) improperly dismissing Plaintiff ’s mental impairments at step two of the \nsequential evaluation; (2) formulating a [RFC] unsupported by any medical opinion \nevidence; and (3) conducting a flawed step -five analysis by identifying jobs that conflict \nwith Plaintiff ’s stooping limitation. ” (Doc. 11 at 8).  The Court  now rules.   \ni. Mental Impairments  \nIn evaluating the severity of mental impairments, the ALJ must rate the degree of \nthe Plaintiff ’s limitation in four broad functional areas , sometimes referred to as the \n“Paragraph B ” areas : (1) “[u]nderstand, remember, or apply information ;” (2) “interact \nwith others ;” (3) “concentrate, persist, or maintain pace ;” and (4) “adapt or manage \noneself .” 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520a (c)(3). The ALJ completes this rating  using  a five -point \nscale: n one, mild, moderate, marked, and extreme.  20 C.F.R. § 404.1520a (c)(4).  \nHere, t he ALJ stated the Paragraph B criteria and analyzed each functional area in \nturn. ( Doc. 10 -2 at 26 ). First, the ALJ found Plaintiff had no limitation in understand ing, \nremember ing, or apply ing information . The ALJ reasoned that Plaintiff “did not report or \ntestify to [relevant] limitations ” and psychiatric exams consistently showed Plaintiff was \nalert, oriented, and that he understood his medications. (Id.). The ALJ also  pointed out  that \nPlaintiff “was noted to understand the risks and be able to make an informed decision \nregarding leaving the hospital against medical advice. ” (Id.).  \nNext, t he ALJ found Plaintiff had no limitation in interacting with others. The ALJ Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 6 of 14 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n explained Plaintiff “reported no issues getting along with others ” and “[p]sychiatric exams \nconsistently showed he was alert, oriented, and cooperative. ” (Id.). The ALJ also  cited \nreports that Plaintiff “interact[ed] well with other patients and staff during his inpatient \ntreatment . . . [and] had cooperative  and pleasant behavior with appropriate eye contact and \ngood hygiene. ” (Id.).  \nThe ALJ then found Plaintiff had no limitation in concentrating, persisting, or \nmaintain ing pace. (Id.). The ALJ again noted that Plaintiff “did not report difficulties in \nthis area. ” (Id.). Plaintiff was also “noted to participate in therapy sessions and [he] \nverbalized [an] understanding of information regarding his medications, their uses, and \npossible side effects. ” (Id.). Finally, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was mildly limited in \nadapting or managing himself. The ALJ cited Plaintiff ’s testimony that he is homeless and \n“that despite going through inpatient detox  treatment , he continues to use illicit \nsubstances .” (Id.).   \nPlaintiff now argues that “[t]he ALJ ’s evaluation of the paragraph B criteria is \nlegally insufficient. ” (Doc. 11 at 10). Specifically, Plaintiff takes issue with the ALJ ’s \ncitation of evidence from the period during which Plaintiff received inpatient treatment , \nbecause “Plaintiff was in a highly structured, monitored treatment environment, ” which \ndoes not reflect “Plaintiff ’s functioning in the real world or in any competitive work \nsetting. ” (Id.). The Commissioner responds that  “Plaintiff does not cite any evidence to \nshow that his mental functioning outside the ‘highly structured ’ environment of substance \nuse treatment indicated mental limitations. ” (Doc. 15 at 8).  Similarly, Plaintiff argues that  \n“[t]he ALJ failed to acknowledge that these ‘normal ’ mental status observations occurred \nduring Plaintiff ’s brief inpatient treatment stay and may not have been sustained following \ndischarge. ” (Doc. 11 at 10). The Commissioner responds  that Plaintiff again did not \nprovide any evidence “that normal mental status examination findings ‘may not have been \nsustained ’ following discharge from treatment. ” (Doc. 15 at 9). The Court agrees with the \nCommissioner  on this point ; the ALJ properly analyzed Plaintiff ’s mental impairments \nusing the evidence available  in the record .  Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 7 of 14 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n The Court also finds unpersuasive Plaintiff ’s evidentiary citations. For example,  \nPlaintiff cites his  own testimony that he had “relaps[ed] and was not in a period of sustained \nabstinence. ” (Doc. 11 at 10).  But this testimony alone does not establish a severe \nimpairment in any of the Paragraph B areas, and Plaintiff did not otherwise testify to \nspecific mental limitations.  Similarly, while it is true that some providers indicated that \nPlaintiff presented as “obviously irritable anxious, ” this was one step below the most \n“extreme ” option,3 suggesting that this still would not fit a “severe ” rating. ( See, e.g., Doc. \n10-14 at 81, 113; Doc. 10 -15 at 31, 95; Doc. 10 -16 at 77; Doc. 10 -17 at 139).  \nPlaintiff also cites the “broad regimen of psychotropic medications ” prescribed “by \nhis treating provider for anxiety and related symptoms. ” (Doc. 11 at 11). It appears  to the \nCourt  that many of these medications were prescribed for opioid withdrawal and were only \nprescribed during Plaintiff ’s inpatient treatment stay , undermining Plaintiff ’s claim that the \nmedications “reflect ongoing, clinically significant anxiety that impacts daily life .” (Doc. \n11 at 11; see Doc. 10 -14 at 3 –33). Thus, the ALJ did not e rr in not relying on these \nmedications; Plaintiff ’s attempts on appeal to recast them as something other than what the \nrecord supports does not show error by the ALJ.    \nIn the Reply,  Plaintiff states that a “state agency psychological consultant . . . \ndetermined Plaintiff ’s anxiety was severe. ” (Doc. 17 at 2). It appears to the Court that the \nstate agency psychological consultant did not speak with Plaintiff and specifically stated \nthat there was “insufficient evidence to substantiate the presence of [anxiety or \ndepression]. ” (AR 89 -90). Plaintiff also states that “Dr. Adriann e Galluci Ph.D. determined \nthat Plaintiff ’s depression was severe. ” (Doc. 17 at 2). In fact , Dr. Galluci also specifically \nstated  there was “insufficient evidence to substantia te the presence of [anxiety or \ndepression] ” and there was “no indication of other [mental health] issues. ” (AR 109). Thus, \nthe ALJ did not err in finding that the record did not support a finding of a severe mental \nimpairment.  \nPlaintiff points to the fact that a t least two other providers found that Plaintiff \n \n3 The provider could have selected the following option: “Patient so irritable or anxious \nthat participation in the assessment is difficult.” (AR 1472).  Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 8 of 14 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n presented as irritable, anxious, and/or guarded. ( Doc. 10 -16 at 16, 111 ). Additionally , a \nnon-physician conducting a mental health assessment noted that “[s]coring of pre -\nscreening for depression symptoms may be influenced by masking of emotions and/or poor \nemotional intelligence, as patient reported experiencing thoughts of ‘not wanting to live ’ \nprior to treatment admission. ” (Doc. 10 -15 at 163 ). This evidence, without more, does not \nsuggest a “severe ” mental impairment, and the ALJ therefore did not err i n not interpreting \nthis evidence in the way Plaintiff argues it should be interpreted.  \nIn conclusion, t he Court agrees  with the Commissioner  that “[t]he ALJ relied on the \nevidence of mental status that was available in the record and reasonably concluded that it \ndid not show that Plaintiff had any mental limitations that warranted inclusion in the RFC. ” \n(Doc. 15 at 9).  \nii. Medical Evidence  \n1. Development of Record  \nPlaintiff argues that because “agency medical consultants did not offer any \nopinion, ” the ALJ “should have recognized the record was inadequate and exercised his \nduty to further develop the record – for example, by ordering a consultative examination \nor calling a medical expert to review the imaging. ” (Doc. 11 at 13 –14).  \nPlaintiff is correct that the ALJ has a duty to develop the record fully and fairly. \nTonapetyan v. Halter , 242 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir. 2001). One way that a n ALJ may \ndischarge this duty is by “keeping the record open after the hearing to allow \nsupplementation of the record. ” Id. Here, the ALJ  did not err because this duty was \ndischarged when the AL J gave Plaintiff two extra weeks after the hearing to obtain \nadditional medical records. ( Doc. 10 -2 at 45 ).  \nNormally, the inquiry would end here. However, Plaintiff ’s claim of error on \nappeal —that the record was inadequately developed due to ALJ error —is refuted by the \nrecord itself , which shows that the fault in developing the record lies with Plaintiff himself.  \nOn June 6, 2022, the agency attempted to contact Plaintiff ’s counsel. (Doc. 10 -3 at 6). The \nagency “was on hold for 10 minutes, ” was “unable to reach [a] live person, ” and left a Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 9 of 14 \n- 10 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n voicemail that alerted counsel that if certain materials were not received in 10 days, the \nagency would “have to make a decision with what [was]  in [the] file ,” which  could “result \nin a determination of not disabled. ” (Id.). On June 15, 2022, the agency again attempted to \ncontact Plaintiff ’s counsel , was unable to reach anyone, and left a nother  voicemail \ninforming counsel that “failure to respond within 10 days of this notice could result in an \nunfavorable decision due to not cooperating .”4 (Id.). The record also reflects that the agency \nattempted to contact Plaintiff himself, but that his voicemail inbox was full, and the agency \nwas unable to leave a voicemail message. ( Id. at 6).  \nRegarding  Plaintiff ’s physical symptoms, Consultative Examiner Dea ultimately \nconcluded that he would not request a consultative exam and recommended insufficient \nevidence for this claim. ( Id. at 7 (“. . . Very little ME in file to determine severity. . . . I \nhave attempted on numerous occasions to speak to the clmt and AR with no luck. DP is \ncomplete and forms have not been returned. Because of noncooperation I will not be \nrequesting a CE. [] [R]ecommending IE for this clm. ”)). Dea made similar findings \nregarding  Plaintiff ’s mental impairments. ( Id. “Clmt is a 51 yo alleging depression and \nanxiety. There is no ME in file to support these allegations. I have attempted on numerous \noccasions to speak to the clmt and AR with no luck. DP is complete and forms have not \nbeen returned. Because of noncooperatio n I will not be requesting a CE. [] \n[R]ecommending IE for this clm. ”)). Consultative Examiner s Amon and Abrahimi agreed. \n(Doc. 10 -3 at 8 –9). Consequently , the agency concluded that Plaintiff was not disabled. \n(Id. at 10).  \nPlaintiff sought reconsideration of this conclusion . It was  again  noted that there was \nlimited medical evidence in the file and that Plaintiff had not provided necessary forms. \n(Doc. 10 -3 at 26).  Consultative Examiner Mallik concluded that there was insufficient \nevidence to adjudicate Plaintiff ’s claim. ( Id. at 27 ). Regarding Plaintiff ’s mental \n \n4 Specifically, A. Brown captured the following notes: “Left vm informing if I have sent \nforms to complete, however, they have not been submitted. We also need to schedule a \nconsultative examination, however, prior to scheduling the exam, we need to ensure you \nand/or your client is cooperating. Failure to  respond within 10 days of this notice could \nresult in an unfavorable decision due to not cooperating.”  (Doc. 10 -3 at 6).  Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 10 of 14 \n- 11 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n impairments, Consultative Examiner Gallucci  agreed. ( Id. at 28).  \nAn ALJ does not err if the ALJ tries to procure  a consultative medical opinion but  \ncannot do so because “the consultative examiners lacked sufficient information due to \nPlaintiff ’s own failure to provide necessary information .” Diaz v. Comm ’r of Soc. Sec. , \n1:24-CV-00704 -EPG, 2025 WL 2299515 , at *5  (E.D. Cal. Aug. 8, 2025). Put differently, \na Plaintiff may not appeal on the basis “that the ALJ erred by failing to obtain a consultative \nmedical opinion where the ALJ attempted to obtain that opinion, but the consultative \nexaminer concluded that it had insufficient information because Plaintiff did not provide \nrequested information.” Id. at *3. This is, i n part, based on the duty  Plaintiff  has to provide \ninformation to the agency. See Social Security Ruling (SSR) 17 -4p (claimants and their \nrepresentative s have affirmative duty  “to act with reasonable promptness to help obtain the \ninform ation or evidence that the claimant must submit and forward the information or \nevidence to us as soon as practicable ”).  \nHere,  neither Plaintiff nor Plaintiff ’s counsel provided requisite  information to the \nagency. T he consultative examiners , initially and upon reconsideration , reviewed the \nevidence in the record and found it insufficient to establish a disability . When the case \ncame before the ALJ, the ALJ correctly “did not rely on Plaintiff ’s failure to [cooperate]  . \n. . as a basis for finding Plaintiff not disabled ,” but rather “evaluated Plaintiff ’s claim on \nthe evidence presented, including the medical evidence of record and Plaintiff ’s testimony, \nand rendered an RFC and determination based on that evidence. ” Diaz , 2025 WL 2299515 , \nat *6. Accordingly, the Court finds that the ALJ did not err  in this regard.  \n2. “Playing Doctor ”  \nPlaintiff generally objects to the ALJ ’s RFC  findings because , Plaintiff argues,  the \nALJ “derived ” them “from his own reading of the raw medical data. ” (Doc. 11 at 12).  \nPlaintiff specifically takes issue with the ALJ “independently translating MRI and CT scan \nresults – which showed severe spinal pathology – into specific work limitations. ” (Doc. 11 \nat 12). The Commissioner responds that the scan results cited by the ALJ “were not raw \nimages that the ALJ interpreted with no medical guidance, but rather summaries of Case 2:25-cv-00365-JAT     Document 20     Filed 09/05/25     Page 11 of 14 \n- 12 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n ‘impression[s] ’ or ‘findings ’ from a medical professional. ” (Doc. 15 at 10). The Court \nagrees with the Commissioner. The ALJ uses the language of , and cites to , the impressions \nand findings from medical providers , but does not rely on its own interpretation  of any \n“raw medical data .” (AR 28 (citing Exhibit 9F)). To the extent that Plaintiff argues that the \nALJ could not make an RFC determination because “no doctor . . . opined at all on \nPlaintiff ’s functional capacities, ” the Court addressed that argument above and will not \nrepeat its reasoning.5 (Doc. 11 at 12 ; see also Doc. 11 at 14 ).  \niii. Stooping Limitation  \nFinally, Plaintiff argues the ALJ ’s RFC finding is not supported by substantial \nevidence because there is a conflict between the jobs that ALJ found Plaintiff could \nperform and the ALJ ’s finding that Plaintiff could “occasionally . . . stoop. ” (Doc. 11 at \n15–16; Doc. 10 -2 at 28).  A person that can stoop “occasionally ” can stoop “up to one -third \nof the time. ” Titles II & Xvi: Capability to Do Other Work -Themedical -Vocational Rules \nAs A Framework for Evaluating Solely Nonexertional Impairments , SSR 85 -15, at *7 \n(1985) . \nBased on the RFC, t he ALJ adopted the vocational expert ’s testimony that Plaintiff \ncould perform the requirements of a marker, housekeeper cleaner, or cafeteria attendant. \n(Doc. 10 -2 at 33) . Plaintiff states that the Dictionary of Occupation al Titles (“DOT”) states \nthat stooping is “frequent ” for both the marker and housekeeper cleaner positions.  (Doc. \n11 at 16).   \nUpon review, the Court finds th is to be  incorrect  and is unclear where Plaintiff is \n \n5  Plaintiff relies on Day v. Weinberger , 522 F.2d 1154 (9th Cir. 1975) to support his \nargument.  (Doc. 11 at 12, 14 –15). However, the Court agrees with the Commissioner that \nPlaintiff’s reliance on Day is misplaced. ( See Doc. 15 at 11). In Day, the ALJ went outside \nthe record and consulted “medical textbooks for the purpose of making his own exploration \nand assessment as to claimant’s physical condition.” 522 F.2d at 1156. Here, Plaintiff does \nnot allege that the ALJ consulted any outside sourc es.  \nFurthermore, in Day, the ALJ rejected two, uncontradicted medical opinions and \ninstead relied on the ALJ’s own observations of the claimant and the claimant’s answer to \na question. 522 F.2d at 1157. Here, Plaintiff does not argue that the ALJ rejected  medical \nopinions, but rather argues that the ALJ “played doctor” when the ALJ “derive[d] ultimate \nfunctional conclusions from raw data that has not been translated by a doctor.” (Doc. 11 at \n14). As the Commissioner explains, Day “did not  . . . find that remand was warranted based \non the discounting of a medical source statement and an ALJ substituting his own judgment \nfor that of a medical source.” (Doc. 15 at 11 –12).

For the \nhousekeeper cleaner  and cafeteria attendant  position s, the DOT states that stooping \n“[e]xists up to 1/3 of the time. ” 323.687 -014 Cleaner, Housekeeping, DICOT 323.687 -014, \n1991 WL 672783 ; 311.677 -010 Cafeteria Attendant, DICOT 311.677 -010, 1991 WL \n672694 . Because these limitations are consistent with the RFC, t here is no conflict, and the \nALJ did not err.6  \niv. Conclusion  \nIn making its RFC determination, the ALJ started with an in -depth review of the \nmedical record. (Doc. 10 -2 at 28 –29). The ALJ listed specific examples of medical \nevidence that “fail[ed] to provide strong support for [Plaintiff ’s] allegations of disabling \nsymptoms and limitations. ” (Id. at 29).  The ALJ concluded that although  Plaintiff ’s \n“medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause the alleged \nsymptoms [,] . . . [Plaintiff ’s] statements concerning the intensity, persistence and limiting \neffects of these symptoms are not entirely consistent with the medical evidence and other \nevidence in the reco rd for the reasons explained in this decision. ” (Id. at 30).  The ALJ gave  \nspecific  examples of some of Plaintiff ’s statements  the ALJ found inconsistent . (Id.). \nFinally , the ALJ found that while the record supported the finding of severe impairments , \nadditional evidence supported the ALJ ’s RFC findings. (Id. at 31). The ALJ listed examples  \nof such supporting evidence , with citations to the record . (Id.). All cited records support \nthe ALJ ’s conclusions,  and the Court therefore finds that the ALJ ’s opinion was supported \nby substantial evidence.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nBased on the foregoing,  \n \n6 Because there is simply no conflict between the ALJ’s RFC and the positions that the \nvocational expert testified Plaintiff could perform, the Court finds wholly unpersuasive the \nremainder of Plaintiff’s arguments. For example, Plaintiff cites Pinto v. Massanari , 249 \nF.3d 840 , 847  (9th Cir. 2001) , which holds  that an ALJ need only “explain [the] deviation” \nwhen  the ALJ relies on a job description “that fails to comport with a claimant’s noted \nlimitations ,” which is not the case here . (See Doc. 15 at 14 (“There is no deviation here \nbetween  Plaintiff’s noted limitations in the RFC and the requirements of the jobs the \nvocational expert testified to, and thus no further explanation was required.”)).

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana reviewed Waste Management of Virginia, Inc.'s motion for attorneys’ fees following a lawsuit filed by Cindy Adams, who alleged various wrongdoings by her former employer, Waste Management. Although her claims were dismissed with prejudice, the court had to determine Waste Management's reasonable entitlement to attorney fees, resulting in an award of $35,872.65. While artificial intelligence is mentioned in the context of the legal expertise of one of the attorneys, it does not play a role in the facts, claims, or holding of this case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The primary legal issue was whether Waste Management was entitled to the claimed attorneys' fees and, if so, the determination of a reasonable amount according to the lodestar method of calculation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that Waste Management was entitled to attorneys' fees but reduced the initially requested amount by 10% due to hours spent on a moot motion for sanctions, ultimately awarding $35,872.65.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a big argument with someone about stuff going back many years, and they bring a friend to help them argue. When the argument is finally over, a judge says the friend's time is valuable and needs to be paid for, but decides that some of the friend’s efforts weren’t necessary. So, the judge cuts down the total time you have to pay for and tells you exactly how much you owe. This decision includes calculating how much people usually get paid for this kind of work and deciding what's fair.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA  \n \nCINDY MARIE WEBER MONTGOMERY, JR./ADAMS -II   CIVIL ACTION \n  \nVERSUS          NUMBER: 2 4-2432 \n  \nCONSUELO ANDERSON, ET AL.      SECTION: “ R” (5)  \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nBefore the Court is Defendant Waste Management of Virginia, Inc.’s Motion for \nAttorneys’ Fees.  (Rec. doc. 140).1  The motion is unopposed.  Having reviewed the pleading, \nthe record, and the case law, the Court finds and recommends as follows.  \nI. Background  \nPlaintiff Cindy Adams initially filed a complaint in this Court pro se in October 2024 \nand retained counsel in December 2024.  (Rec. doc. 1).  Counsel filed a first amended \ncomplaint in January 2025, in which P laintiff alleged causes of action against 19 named \ndefendants, as well as six unknown insurance companies.  (Rec. doc. 11).  The complaint \nasserted claims for a range of unconnected conduct dating back to 2002.   (Id.).  \nOne of the named d efendants is Waste Management of Virginia, Inc. (“Waste \nManagement”). Plaintiff alleged that Waste Management was the former employer of \nPlaintiff and was involved in sexual harassment of and retaliation against P laintiff, and that \nit conspired with other defendants to harm her.   (Id. at 6 -7, 15).  Plaintiff sued Waste \nManagement for racial discrimination, employment discrimination, civil conspiracy, \nnegligence, tortious conduct, libel and slander, intentional infliction of emotional distr ess, \npunitive damages, and litigation expenses and attorney fees.   (Id. at 18 -35).  Waste \n \n1 The District Court referred the motion to the undersigned under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b).  (Rec. doc. 255).   Case 2:24-cv-02432-SSV-MBN     Document 149     Filed 09/30/25     Page 1 of 112 \n Management answered and asserted a counterclaim against plaintiff for breach of contract,  \nbased upon a release agreement entered  between Plaintiff and Waste Management in \nOctober 2020, in which plaintiff released any and all claims against Waste Management \narising from her employment with or separation from Waste Management and based on \ndiscrimination or retaliation, among other bases.   (Rec. doc. 59).   Plaintiff did not respond to \nthe counterclaim.  \nWaste Management then moved  for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c)  and \nfor sanctions .  (Rec. docs. 103, 127).  The District Court granted the motion for judgment on \nthe pleadings, dismissing Plaintiff’s claims with prejudice, and denied the motion for \nsanctions as moot.  (Rec. doc. 132).  The instant motion followed .  Waste Management seeks \n$65,116.98 in attorney’s fees on behalf of  its attorneys,  Littler Mendelson, P.C.  (Rec. doc. \n140).  Waste Management’s entitlement to fees is undisputed.  Thus, the Court will address only the amount of attorney’s fees and costs owed.   \nII. Law and Analysis  \nA. The Lodestar Approach  \n The United States Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit have often repeated that a \nrequest for attorneys’ fees should not spawn major ancillary litigation.  Hensley v. Eckerhart , \n461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983); Associated Builders & Contractors of La., Inc. v. Orleans Par. School Bd., 919 F.2d 374, 379 (5th Cir. 1990).  A court’s discretion in fashioning a reasonable \nattorney’s fee is broad and reviewable only for an abuse of discretion, i.e. , it will not be \nreversed unless there is strong evidence that it is exces sive or inadequate, or the amount \nchosen is clearly erroneous.  Hensley , 461 U.S. at 436- 37; Hopwood v. State of Tex. , 236 F.3d \n256, 277 n.79 (5th Cir. 2000).  Case 2:24-cv-02432-SSV-MBN     Document 149     Filed 09/30/25     Page 2 of 113 \n To determine a reasonable fee, the Court must provide a concise but clear explanation \nof its reasons for the fee award, making subsidiary factual determinations regarding whether \nthe requested hourly rate is reasonable, and whether the tasks reported by co unsel were \nduplicative, unnecessary, or unrelated to the purposes of the lawsuit.   Hensley , 461 U.S. at \n437- 39; Associated Builders & Contractors , 919 F.2d at 379.  The Fifth Circuit has noted that \nits “concern is not that a complete litany be given, but that the findings be complete enough to assume a review which can determine whether the court has used proper factual criteria \nin exercising its discretion to fix just compensation.”  Brantley v. Surles , 804 F.2d 321, 325-\n26 (5th Cir. 1986).  \nIn assessing the reasonableness of attorneys’ fees, the Court must first determine the \n\"lodestar\" by multiplying the reasonable number of hours expended and the reasonable hourly rate for each participating attorney.  See Hensley , 461 U.S. at 433; Green v. Adm’rs of \nthe Tulane Educ. Fund , 284 F.3d 642, 661 (5th Cir. 2002), overruled on other grounds by  \nBurlington N. & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006); Migis v. Pearle Vision, Inc. , \n135 F.2d 1041, 1047 (5th Cir. 1998); La. Power & Light Co. v . Kellstrom , 50 F.3d 319, 324 (5th \nCir. 1995).  The lodestar is presumed reasonable, but a court may then enhance or decrease \nit after considering the twelve Johnson factors.   Fessler v. Porcelana Corona De Mexico, S.A. \nDe C.V ., 23 F.4th 408, 415 (5th Cir. 2022) (citing Combs v. City of Huntington, 829 F.3d 388, \n392 (5th Cir. 2016)).  “‘[T]he most critical factor’ in determining a reasonable fee ‘is the degree of success obtained.’”  Combs , 829 F.3d at 394 (quoting Hensley , 461 U.S. at 436).  The \nfee applicant bears the burden of proof on the lodestar issue, but once calculated, the party \nseeking modification of the lodestar under the Johnson factors bears the burden.  See Fessler, Case 2:24-cv-02432-SSV-MBN     Document 149     Filed 09/30/25     Page 3 of 114 \n 23 F.4th at 416; Riley v. City of Jackson , 99 F.3d 757, 760 (5th Cir. 1996); La. Power, 50 F.3d \nat 324; In re Smith , 996 F.2d 973, 978 (5th Cir. 1992).  \n  1. Reasonable Hourly Rates  \n“‘[R]easonable’ hourly rates ‘are to be calculated according to the prevailing market \nrates in the relevant community.’”  McClain v. Lufkin Indus., Inc ., 649 F.3d 374, 381 (5th Cir. \n2011) (quoting Blum v. Stenson , 465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984)).  “[T]he burden is on the fee \napplicant to produce satisfactory evidence—in addition to the attorney’s own affidavits —\nthat the requested rates are in line with those prevailing in the community for similar \nservices by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill.”  Blum , 465 U. S. at 895 n.11.  “An \nattorney’s requested hourly rate is prima facie reasonable when [he] requests that the lodestar be computed at [his] ‘customary billing rate,’ the rate is within the range of \nprevailing market rates and the rate is not contested.”  White v. Imperial Adjustment Corp. , \nNo. 99 -3804, 2005 WL 1578810, at *5 (E.D. La. June 28, 2005) (citing La. Power, 50 F.3d at \n328) (emphasis added).   \nIn its fee submission, Waste Management seeks fees on behalf of two attorneys: \nBradford J. Kelley and Sean P. O’Brien.  Kelley is a shareholder at Littler Mendelson, P.C.  \nKelley graduated magna cum laude from LSU Paul M. Hebert Law Center, was inducted into \nthe Order of the Coif, and served as an editor for the Louisiana Law Review.  (Rec. doc. 140 -\n1 at 5).  After law school, Kelley clerked for the Honorable Donald Walter of the U.S. District Court for the  Western District of Louisiana.  Kelley was admitted to the Louisiana Bar in \n2013, suggesting that he has approximately 12 years of experience.  Kelley specializes in \nlabor and employment law and has extensive experience, accolades, and publications related Case 2:24-cv-02432-SSV-MBN     Document 149     Filed 09/30/25     Page 4 of 115 \n to that specialty.  Kelley seeks a rate of $646.00/hour for his work in this case.  ( Rec. doc. \n140- 1 at 4 -6).   \nO’Brien is an associate at Littler Mendelson, P.C. , who has over five years of practice \nexperience since graduating cum laude  from the University of Memphis Cecil C. Humphreys \nSchool of Law in 2019.  O’Brien focuses his practice on employment discrimination, \nharassment, leave and accommodation matters, artificial intelligence, and wage and hours \ndisputes.  He has served as first chair in approximately ten bench trials, has published \nnumerous articles on labor and employment law top ics, and has presented at events such as \na continuing legal education seminar focused on the current state of labor and employment \nlaw.  O’Brien seeks a rate of $335.75/hour.  ( Id.).   \nAs noted above, “ an attorney’s requested hourly rate is prima facie reasonable when \n[he] requests that the lodestar be computed at [his] ‘customary billing rate,’ the rate is within the range of prevailing market rates and the rate is not contested.”  White , 2005 WL 1578810, \nat *5 (citing La. Power , 50 F.3d at 328) (emphasis added).  However, the Court may reduce \nthe hourly rate if it determines that the requested rate is not within the range of prevailing \nmarket rates.  Richard v. St. Tammany Par. Sheriff' s Dep't , No. CV 17 -9703, 2022 WL 4534728, \nat *11 (E.D. La. Sept. 28, 2022), appeal dismissed sub nom. Richard v. Smith , No. 22 -30497, \n2023 WL 2845201 (5th Cir. Jan. 27, 2023).  Thus, the Court in its discretion will assess \nwhether the uncontested rates fall within the range of prevailing market rates.  \nNotably, counsel did not include an affidavit, outside of Kelley’s own personal \ntestimony, of other attorneys practicing in this District establishing that the requested  rates \nare in line with prevailing rates in this community.  Bd. of Supervisors of Louisiana State Univ. \nv. Smack Apparel Co ., No. CV 04 -1593, 2007 WL 9770644, at *10 (E.D. La. May 23, 2007), Case 2:24-cv-02432-SSV-MBN     Document 149     Filed 09/30/25     Page 5 of 116 \n report and recommendation adopted , No. CV 04 -1593, 2007 WL 9770643 (E.D. La. Aug. 28, \n2007)  (“Generally, the reasonable hourly rate for a particular community is established \nthrough affidavits of other attorneys practicing there.” ) (quoting Tollett v. City of Kemah , 285 \nF.3d 357, 368 (5th Cir. 2002) ); Herbert v. Audubon Comm'n , No. CV 15 -5425, 2017 WL \n5900978, at *2  (E.D. La. Nov. 30, 2017) (reminding Plaintiff’s counsel that as applicants, they \nbear burden of producing satisfactory evidence that their rates are in line with other similar \nservices in this District.).  Most importantly, both requested hourly rates are not reflect ive of \nthe prevailing rates in this community.  For these reasons, reductions are warranted.  \nKelley has approximately 12  years of experience and seeks a rate of $646.00/hour.  A \nsignificant reduction is necessary to reflect rates awarded to other attorneys with similar experience in this District.  MGMTL, L .L.C. v. Strategic Tech. Inst., Inc ., No. CV 20 -2138, 2025 \nWL 958208, at *38  (E.D. La. Mar. 31, 2025)  (awarding a then- current rate of $275.00/hour \nto an attorney with 11 years of experience);  Grant v. Gusman , No. CV 17 -2797, 2023 WL \n315937, at *13  (E.D. La. Jan. 19, 2023)  (reducing a proposed billing rate of $350 per hou r to \n$275 for an attorney with 11 years of experience) ; Jones v. New Orleans Reg'l Physician Hosp. \nOrg., No. CV 17 -8817, 2019 WL 6770029 (E.D. La. Dec. 12, 2019) (reducing rate of attorney \nwith 13 years of experience from $350.00/hour to $300.00/hour); Shaw v. Alpha Air & \nHeating, L.L.C ., No. CV 22 -3953, 2024 WL 1556861, at *3  (E.D. La. Apr. 10, 2024) (reducing \nrate of attorney with 13 -14 years of experience from $500.00/hour to $350.00/hour) .  \nRecently, this Court awarded a rate significantly lower rate than that requested by Kelley to an attorney with nearly 40 years of experience, more than double the years of experience \npossessed by Kelley.  Archer W. Contractors, L.L.C. v. McDonnel Grp., L.L.C., No. CV 22 -5323, \n2025 WL 2088911, at *4 -5 (E.D. La. July 9, 2025),  report  and recommendation adopted  Case 2:24-cv-02432-SSV-MBN     Document 149     Filed 09/30/25     Page 6 of 117 \n (reducing the requested hourly rate of an attorney with 39 years of experience from \n$530/hour to $500/hour).  Moreover,  none of the cases cited by Waste Management award \na rate as high as that requested by Kelley for an attorney with similar experience.   \nAccordingly, the Court awards Kelley a rate of $3 40.00/hour.   \nThe Court now turns to O’Brien, who has over five years of experience and seeks a \nrate of $335.75/hour.  That rate is slightly excessive in light of those typically awarded in \nthis District.  MGMTL , 2025 WL 958208, at *38 (reducing the rate of an attorney with five to \neight years of experience from $280.00/hour to $225.00/hour); Engender, LLC v. Cypress Zone Prods. , L.L.C ., No. CV 20 -1591, 2021 WL 3423589, *2  (E.D. La. Aug. 5, 2021) (finding a \nrate of $260.00/hour reasonable for an attorney with seven years of experience); EnVen Energy Ventures, LLC v. Black Elk Energy Offshore Operations, LLC , 2015 WL 3505099, at *2-\n3 (E.D. La. June 3, 2015)  (finding hourly rate of $275 for associate  with seven years of \nexperience to be reasonable) .  The Court award s O’Brien a rate of $275.00/hour.   \n2. Reasonable Hours Expended  \n The party seeking the fee bears the burden of documenting and supporting the \nreasonableness of all time expenditures for which compensation is sought.  Hensley , 461 U.S. \nat 437.  “Counsel for the prevailing party should make a good faith effort to exclude from a \nfee request hours that are excessive, redundant, and otherwise unnecessary . . .”  Id.  at 434.  \nHours that are not properly billed to one’s client are not properly billed to one’s adversary.  Id.  The Supreme Court calls on fee applicants to make a fee request that demonstrates \n“billing judgment.”  Id.  The remedy for failing to exercise “billing judgment” is to exclude \nhours that were not reasonably expended.  Id.  at 434; Walker v. City of Mesquite, 313 F.3d \n246, 251 (5th Cir. 2002) (quoting Walker v. HUD , 99 F.3d 761, 770 (5th Cir. 1996)) (“If there Case 2:24-cv-02432-SSV-MBN     Document 149     Filed 09/30/25     Page 7 of 118 \n is no evidence of billing judgment, however, then the proper remedy is not a denial of fees, \nbut a reduction of ‘the hours awarded by a percentage intended to substitute for the exercise of \nbilling judgment. ’” (emphasis added)).  Alternatively, this Court can conduct a line- by-line \nanalysis of the time report.  See Green , 284 F.3d at 662; Cameron v. Greater New Orleans Fed. \nCredit Union , No. CV 16- 8514, 2017 WL 1426970, at *2 (E.D. La. Apr. 21, 2017).  \n Waste Management argues that the 129.60 hours sought are reasonable because \ncounsel exercised billing judgment by excluding unproductive, redundant, or otherwise non-\nbillable tasks.  Waste Management further argues that its requested hours are reasonable \nbecause it obtained dismissal of all claims against it, secured judgment in its favor on its \ncounterclaim, and because the case involved numerous independent defendants, requiring it to monitor their filings to assess potential implications for its own defense strategy.  (Rec. \ndoc. 140- 1 at 3 -4).  Having reviewed counsel for Waste Management’s timesheets, the Court \nfinds minor deductions are warranted.  \n  “‘[T]he most critical factor’ in determining a reasonable fee ‘is the degree of success \nobtained.’”  Combs , 829 F.3d at 394 (quoting Hensley , 461 U.S. at 436).  “When u sing the \nlodestar method to award  attorney  fees, courts routinely deduct time spent on unsuccessful, \nunfounded  or unnecessary pleadings, motions, discovery requests and memoranda.”   \nKuperman v. ICF Int'l , No. CV 08 -565, 2009 WL 10737138, *7  (E.D. La. Oct. 13, 2009)  \n(quoting  White , 2005 WL 1578810, at *11) .  In Kuperman , the Court preserved  time spent on \nsome unsuccessful motions but reduc ed time for other s, finding  that counsel should not “ be \npenalized for every  unsuccessful  motion” because “an attorney must represent his client \nzealously,” and unsuccessful motions are “fully expected aspects of that representation.”  (Id.).   Case 2:24-cv-02432-SSV-MBN     Document 149     Filed 09/30/25     Page 8 of 119 \n  Here, Waste Management seeks significant time for its motions for sanctions that the \nDistrict Court denied as moot.  (Rec. doc. 140 -3 at 12 -16).   The District Court found Waste \nManagement’s motion for sanctions moot because attorney’s fees are proper, and Waste \nManagement cannot recover duplicative attorney’s fees for the same conduct.  (Rec. doc. 132 \nat 15 -16).  Of the 129.60 hours for wh ich counsel seeks fees , over 30 of those hours were \nexpended related to the unsuccessful motion for sanctions.  ( Id.).  Recognizing , however,  that  \nthe work expended on the motion for sanctions was  nonetheless  a useful part of the litigation \nstrategy, rather than a line- by-line reduction, the Court recommends a mere 10% reduction \nof the hours sought.   \nB. The Johnson  Factors  \n As noted above, the lodestar is presumed reasonable, but a court may then enhance \nor decrease it after considering the twelve Johnson  factors.  See Johnson v. Ga. Highway \nExpress, Inc. , 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), abrogated on other grounds by Blanchard v. \nBergeron , 489 U.S. 87, 90 (1989).

Lastly, “to the extent that any  Johnson factors are \nsubsumed in the lodestar, they should not be reconsidered when determining whether an \nadjustment to the lodestar is required.”  Migis, 135 F.3d at 1047. \n Waste Management makes arguments based on factors one, two, three, four, five, \neight, eleven, and twelve.

Thus, the Johnson factors that \nare relevant to this case are subsumed in the lodestar.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of *Ron David Rock v. Perlow et al.*, the plaintiff, Ron David Rock, sought various forms of extraordinary relief against orders issued by Judge Perlow, arguing they should be voided. The court recommended denying these motions due to the plaintiff's failure to meet legal standards and the use of fabricated legal references, potentially generated using AI. The plaintiff was warned that continued frivolous filings could result in being labeled a vexatious litigant and subject to filing restrictions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the plaintiff has shown sufficient legal grounds to invalidate Judge Perlow’s orders and whether his motions meet the necessary standards for extraordinary judicial relief such as a writ of mandamus.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court recommended denying all motions filed by the plaintiff, noting the lack of legal basis, misuse of legal citations (possibly generated by AI), and notifying the plaintiff of the risk of being declared a vexatious litigant if such filings continue.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're arguing with someone and you make up a story to win. In this case, the person (plaintiff) told the court about fake cases and laws, maybe using a computer program to help, to try to win his argument. The court realized these weren't real and said he couldn't get what he wanted. They also warned him to stop doing this or he might get in trouble in the future.",

Motions [ DNs 34, 36, 43, 48, and 52 ]. The Court referred these \nmotions to Magistrate Judge Lanny King under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B) to prepare a report and \nrecommendation.  Defendants filed various individual or collective responses , Responses  [DNs \n39, 40, 45 -47, & 54] , and Plaintiff filed a reply in support of two Motions, Reply [DN 55]. \nPlaintiff also filed a sur -reply, which need  not be considered.1 The mat ter being ripe for review, \nthe Court hereby RECOMMENDS  that the Motions, [ DNs 34, 36, 43, 48, and 52 ], be DENIED , \nin accord with the below.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 See Chenault v. Randstad USA Mfg. & Logistics , No. 5:18-CV-276-KKC, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 84433, at *9 \n(E.D. Ky. May 20, 2019) . Case 5:24-cv-00181-BJB-LLK     Document 70     Filed 06/27/25     Page 1 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n DISCUSSION  \n1. Emergency Motion to Declare Judge Perlow’s  Orders Void and to Issue a Writ of \nMandamus, Motion for Mandamus , [DN 34], and Motion to Expedite Ruling on \nMotion for Writ of Mandamus,  Motion to Expedite Mandamus,  [DN 36] , \nEmergency Motion to Compel Judicial Action on Pending Motion, Motion to \nCompel J udicial Action [DN 43].  \n  \nOn April 14, 2025, Rock filed an Emergency Motion for  a Writ of Mandamus , seeking to \ninvalidate “all  orders issued by Judge Perlow after October 29, 2020 .” [DN 34 ] at 1. Mandamus \nis a “‘drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved fo r really extraordinary causes. ’” In re King ’s \nDaughters Health Sys ., 31 F.4th 520, 525 (6th Cir. 2022)  (citing Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for the \nDist. of Columbia , 542 U.S. 367, 380  (2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ); \nResponse to Mandamus [DN 39] . Three conditions must be satisfied before such a writ may \nissue . “First, a petitioner must have no other adequate means to attain the relief it desires —a \ncondition designed to ensure that the writ will not be used as a substitute for the regular appeals \nprocess. ” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation s omitted) .  Plaintiff ’s Mandamus Motion  fails \nat the first step. Plaintiff does not attempt to show that he has “no other adequate means” to \nchallenge the various state court orders, or t hat he has actually resorted to the regular appeals \nprocess. Defendants have pointed to this deficiency, [DN 39] at 3, and Plaintiff  concedes that he \n“does not seek appellate review of state orders,” [DN 49] . Because satisfying this condition is \nmandatory,  and Plaintiff indisputably fails to show that he has no other adequate means of to \nattain relief from  any of the state court orders he challenges , this failure alone mandates denial of \nhis Motion for Mandamus. Nonetheless, the Court will review  the other mandamus requirements.  \nIn addition to showing he has no other adequate means of relief, a petitioner must “ show \na clear and indisputable right to the relief sought. ” In re King ’s Daughters Health Sys ., 31 F.4th \nat 525. Plaintiff argues that Judge Perlow’s orders should be declared void due to the state Case 5:24-cv-00181-BJB-LLK     Document 70     Filed 06/27/25     Page 2 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n court’s failure to hold a “mandatory statutory custody hearing” under KRS  § 403.785 (3). He also \nargues that KRS  § 403.785 (3) “calls for action within 11 days.”  [DN 43]  at 1. The entire text of \nKRS  § 403.785 (3) reads: “ Orders of protection shall be enforced in any county of the \nCommonwealth. ” Apart from being completely irrelevant to Plaintiff’s claims, nowhere in the \nremainder of KRS  § 403.785  does it call for any judicia l action to take place “within 11 days” or \nany other timeframe. The Court is  also unable to see how this provision, or any other directive \nunder KRS  § 403.785 , would require a custody hearing, or how the purported absence of such \nhearing would render any s tate court orders void. Pretermitting whether this Court has \njurisdiction to consider this question,  see [DN 5 -1] (Defendants arguing that the Court lacks \nsubject matter jurisdiction to review Plaintiff’s purported collateral attach on a state court \nprocee ding), Plaintiff fails to make a showing that he has “ a clear and indisputable right to the \nrelief sought. ” In re King ’s Daughters Health Sys ., 31 F.4th at 525.  \nAttempting to support this apparently baseless claim for relief, Plaintiff cites to  “Smith v. \nSmith, 2015 -SC-000123” and “Smith v. Smith , 491 S.W.3d 71 (Ky. 2016),” [DN 36 ] at 2, for \nthe proposition that orders issued without a statutory hearing are null. Th ese cases, however, d o \nnot exist and were  either intentionally fabricated or wron gfully included in Plaintiff’s brief by \nrelying on artificial intelligence  or text-generating software.   \nIn his “Memorandum of Law on Subject Matter Jurisdiction,” [DN 51], Plaintiff ‘quotes ’ \nKRS  § 610.010 : “The district court shall have original jurisdict ion to hear cases involving \ndependence, neglect, and abuse of children.” This quotation does not exist  in KRS  § 610.010 . \nThe referenced code also contradicts Plaintiff’s argument that this federal court has original \njurisdiction over matters concerning minor children , as it places jurisdiction in state court . KRS  § Case 5:24-cv-00181-BJB-LLK     Document 70     Filed 06/27/25     Page 3 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n 610.010  (providing that the state “ District Court of each county shall have exclusiv e jurisdiction \nin proceedings concerning ” certain juvenile delinquency matters).  \n“Defendant is reminded that he has an obligation under the Federal Rules to take \n‘necessary care ’ in preparing documents submitted to the court. ” Secura Ins. v. Thompson , No. \n5:23-CV-00066 -BJB-LLK, 2024 WL 4513040, at *2 (W.D. Ky. Aug. 21, 2024)  (citing Cooter & \nGell v. Hartmarx Corp ., 469 U.S. 384, 398 (1990) ). “Necessary care certainly includes \nconfirming that all cases or orders cited to the Court exist. ” Id. (citing Mata v.  Avianca, Inc ., 678 \nF. Supp. 3d 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2023) (sanctioning attorneys for filing motions written in part by \nChatGPT which included non -existent cases) ). It follows that “necessary care” also includes \nconfirming that quotations exist within cited autho rity.  \nUnder the final mandamus requirement, Plaintiff “ must show that issuing the writ is \notherwise appropriate under the circumstances. ” In re King ’s Daughters Health Sys ., 31 F.4th at \n525. Plaintiff has not shown  that a writ is appropriate  here or under the other factors. It is \ntherefore recommended  that the  Motion for Mandamus , [DN 34], be DENIED . Because the \nMotion to Expedite Mandamus , [DN 36] , and Motion to Compel Judicial Action , [DN 43]2, \nappear to have been filed in order to  swiftly  “bring the Court’s attention,” id. at 1, to Plaintiff’s \nApril 14, 2025 , Motion for Mandamus , it is recommended that these Motions be DENIED  as \nmoot .  \n \n \n \n2 While this Motion is styled as  a Motion to Compel Judicial Action on the “pending Emergency Motion for Judicial \nReview of Subject -Matter Jurisdiction, filed April 14, 2025[,]” P laintiff’s only filing on April 14  was for a Motion \nfor Mandamus, [DN 34]. The Court therefore construes the “Motion to Compel  Judicial Action” as being directed at  \nhis Motion for Mandamus, and there exists no pending “Motion for Judicial Review of Subject -Matter Jurisdiction” \non the Court’s docket.   Case 5:24-cv-00181-BJB-LLK     Document 70     Filed 06/27/25     Page 4 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n 2. Emergency Motions for Miscellaneous Relief [DNs 48 & 52]  \nPlaintiff’s First Emergency Motion for Miscellaneous Relief, First Misc. Motion [DN \n48], asks the Court to, inter alia , refer Judge Perlow’s  purported  RICO violations to the U.S. \nAttorney General and FBI for criminal prosecution, investigation, and oversight. Id. at 1. This  \nmotion also requests a grant of summary judgment and default, requests which will be addressed \nby the District Court . Plaintiff’s  Second Emergency Motion for Miscellaneous Relief, Second \nMisc. Motion [DN 52], likewise directs the Court to Defendants’ purported RICO violations. Id. \nat 3. It also reiterates Plaintiff’s request that Judge Perlow’s orders be declared void (which has \nalready been addressed  above ) and seeks relief under additional legal theories such as the False \nClaims Act  (theories which are not  addressed as they are not pled in the operative complaint).  \nBeyond being meritless  from a legal perspective, these motions are full of  language that \nis simply incoherent . For example, the Second Emergency Motion states that “[f]raud findings \nbind all future ca [ sic;] In short no case exist [sic] be litigated and the official case history is the \nvalidation of the claim [.]”  To the extent they can be deciphered at all, they repeat requests for  \nrelief that ha ve already been addressed herein, or that are outside the scope of this Court’s \nauthority . Plaintiff appears to believe that he can initiate a criminal proceeding through thi s civil \naction. As other courts have determined, “[t]his court is without jurisdiction, in this civil \nproceeding, to order a criminal investigation, to initiate a criminal prosecution or to make any \ndetermination concerning ” Defendants’ purported criminal conduc t.  Fodor v. E. Shipbuilding \nGrp., No. 5:12CV28/RS/CJK, 2013 WL 12174647, at *2 (N.D. Fla. Dec. 19, 2013) . Linda R.S. v. \nRichard D ., 410 U.S. 614, 619  (1973) (“[A] private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest \nin the prosecution or nonprosec ution of another.”) . “Not only are we unaware of any authority \nfor permitting a private individual to initiate a criminal prosecution in his own name in a United Case 5:24-cv-00181-BJB-LLK     Document 70     Filed 06/27/25     Page 5 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n States District Court, but also to sanction such a procedure would be to provide a means to \ncircumvent the legal safeguards provided for persons accused of crime.”  Keenan v. McGrath , \n328 F. 2d 610, 611 (1st Cir. 1964) . It is recommended that t he Emergency Motions for \nMiscellaneous Relief , [DNs 48 & 52] , be DENIED . \n \n3. Vexatious Litigant Warning  \nUpon review of the Motions addressed herein, [ DNs 34, 36, 43, 48, and 52 ], as well as \nthe Discovery Motions, [DNs 34 and 42], the undersigned recommends  that Plaintiff be  warned \nthat he risks being deemed a “vexatious litigant” based on his frivolous filings , fabricated \nauthority,  and overall  abuse of the judicial process. See Sultaana v. Corrigan , No. 20 -3896, 2021 \nWL 7160160, at *5 (6th Cir. Sept. 9, 2021)  (providing warning to plaintiff before res tricting \nfiling privileges) ; Franklin v. H.U.D. - Pleasant Run Apts ., No. 1:25 -CV-58, 2025 WL 594642, \nat *2 (S.D. Ohio Feb. 25, 2025)  (formally warning vexatious litigant) , report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 1:25 -CV-58, 2025 WL 1262577 (S.D. Ohio May 1 , 2025) . If he \ncontinues with the wrongful conduct discussed herein, Plaintiff may be restricted from filing  (by, \nfor example, requiring that a licensed attorney review his filings prior to submission)  to prevent  \nfuture frivolous and harassing pleadings . Id. \nPlaintiff’s filings are “ mostly incomprehensible and largely consist [] of repetitive \narguments [.]” Heinz v. Ohio , No. 24 -3856, 2025 U.S. App. LEXIS 10239, *2 (6th Cir. Apr. 28, \n2025)  (restricting plaintiff’s filing privileges) . Plaintiff’s citations to authority have been  \nfictitious , see, e.g.,  [DN 36] at 2 (citing “ Smith v. Smith , 491  S.W.3d 71 (Ky. 2016) ”), or when \nthey do exist, have been completely devoid of support for the proposition  quoted or  argued, see \n[DN 34] ( arguing  that KRS  § 403.785 (3) requires a statutory hearing when it makes no mention Case 5:24-cv-00181-BJB-LLK     Document 70     Filed 06/27/25     Page 6 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n of a hearing). Plaintiff’s arguments otherwise are completely devoid of  merit,  and he has failed \nto address Defendants’ well-taken arguments to the contrary  or has otherwise attem pted to \nconfuse the Court and/or Defendants by disingenuously mislabeling his requests for relief.  \nNamely , in his Motion to Compel Judicial Action , [DN 43] , Plaintiff  post hoc re-label ed his \nMotion for Mandamus , [DN 34] , to be  an “Emergency Motion for Judicial Review of Subject -\nMatter Jurisdiction ” and thereafter attempted to argue that Defendants waived arguments relating  \nto subject -matter jurisdiction , because they did not respond to this fabricated or mislabeled \n“Emergency Motion  for Judicial Review of Subject -Matter Jurisdiction .” Plaintiff cites  \n“Humphrey v. United States, 2023 WL 123456 (W.D. Ky.) ,” [DN 43] at 2, in support of his \nargument, but this case also does not exist.  \nMuch  of Plaintiff’s voluminous filings consist  of incoherent statements a nd arguments —\nwhich suggests that he is using text -generating software to support his baseless requests for relief \nand/or harass Defendants by forcing them to produce cogent legal arguments in response.  \nDefendants ask the court to “ prevent further waste of judicial resources and the [Defendant’s]  \ntime and cost of defending Rock’s frivolous and meritless claims. ” [DN 54 ] at 7. This request is \nwell-taken, and Plaintiff is warned that he must exercise “‘ necessary care ’ in preparing \ndocu ments submitted to the court [,]” Secura Ins ., 2024 WL 4513040, at * 2 (quotations and \ncitations omitted), and should carefully consider whether any future filings are well -supported or \neven necessary.  \n \n \n \n Case 5:24-cv-00181-BJB-LLK     Document 70     Filed 06/27/25     Page 7 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n RECOMMENDATION  \n \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Magistrate Judge RECOMMENDS  the: \n1.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves plaintiff Ross Logan's legal action against defendants LVNV Funding, Resurgent Capital Services, and Johnson Mark. The court set aside a default certificate and quashed service due to the defective summons and service process. The court addressed allegations that the plaintiff's opposition brief was AI-generated with \"hallucinated\" quotations, warning against improper AI use.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the service of process was sufficiently executed to establish personal jurisdiction over the defendants, and whether the use of artificial intelligence in drafting legal opposition is permissible.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court set aside the default judgment, ruling that the summons served to the defendants were defective, lacking the court's seal or the clerk's signature, thus nullifying the service of process. The court denied motions related to the defaults as moot and allowed the plaintiff additional time to serve the defendants properly. It also denied the motion to strike the plaintiff's opposition, which allegedly contained AI-generated content, but left the door open for the defendants to seek sanctions if misuse was proved.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you’re playing a game where you have to follow certain rules, like hitting a target with a ball and saying a magic word. If you don’t hit the target or forget the magic word, you didn’t technically play the turn, so the game doesn’t count it. In this court case, the person bringing the lawsuit didn’t follow all the “play rules” when serving papers (kind of like a notice saying “I’m going to take you to court!”) to the other side. Since they didn’t follow the rules, the game didn’t count, the court said no one’s at fault yet, and the case can start over again if done correctly. Also, they used something like a smart assistant to help write their arguments, but the court said to be careful and use it properly.",

The Court \nwill set aside the default as to all Defendants and will quash service on all Defendants. \nConsequently , the Court will deny as moot the Motion for Default Judgment. \nBACKGROUND \n Plaintiff Ross Logan initiated this action against LVNV Funding, LLC; Resurgent Capital Services, L.P.; and Johnson Mark, LLC (“Defendants”) on September 24, 2025.\n5 On October 23, \n2025, Plaintiff moved for entry of default, seeking the Clerk of Court to enter a default certificate against  all Defendants for their failure to respond or otherwise defend against Plaintiff’s claims.\n6 \nPlaintiff’s returns of service indicated that a third -party process server had personally served a \nsummons and cover letter upon the registered agents and authorized employees for each of the Defendants on September 29, 2025.\n7 However, because it was unclear from these returns of \nservice whether a complaint had also been served upon the Defendants, the Clerk of Court denied entry of default.\n8 \n On October 29, 2025, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Reconsider Entry of Default and provided proofs of service affidavits executed by the third- party process server stating that a \nsummons, cover letter, complaint, and notice of filing exhibits had been served on the registered \n \n4 ECF No. 28, filed November 3, 2025; see also  ECF Nos. 29–31. \n5 ECF No. 1. \n6 ECF No. 12. \n7 ECF Nos. 9–11. \n8 ECF No. 13. Case 2:25-cv-00848-AMA-JCB     Document 35     Filed 11/05/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 2 of 93 \n agents and authorized employees of Defendants respectively.9 With this information, the Court \ngranted Plaintiff’s motion in relevant part and directed the Clerk of Court to enter a default \ncertificate.10 The Clerk of Court then entered the default certificate.11 \n Defendant Johnson Mark , LLC promptly appeared and filed its  Motion to Dismiss and  \nMotion to Set Aside Default  on October 30, 2025, asking the Court to set aside the default \ncertificate and dismis s the action for insufficient process and insufficient service of process .12 \nPlaintiff filed his Opposition  on the same day.13 Defendant Johnson Mark, LLC  filed its Reply \non October 31, 2025.14  \nThen, also on October 31, 2025, Defendants LVNV Funding, LLC and Resurgent Capital \nServices, L.P. appeared and filed their Motion to Set Aside Default and Motion to Dismiss \nAction due to Defective Summons.15  \nThat same day, Defendant Johnson Mark, LLC filed a Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s \nOpposition.16 Plaintiff filed his Revised Memorandum in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss and \n \n9 ECF No. 14, Ex. 1.  \n10 ECF No. 15, filed October 30, 2025.  \n11 ECF No. 16, filed October 30, 2025.  \n12 ECF No. 18; see also  ECF No. 19.  \n13 ECF No. 20; see also  ECF No. 27.  \n14 ECF No. 21.  \n15 ECF No. 23. Be cause Plaintiff admits in his Opposition to Defendant Johnson Mark, LLC’s \nMotion to Dismiss and Motion to Set Aside Default that all Defendants were served defective \nsummons, those  Motions , which are fully briefed, establish that default must be set aside as to all \nDefendants and that service should be quashed as to all Defendants. Thus, Defendant s LVNV \nFunding, LLC and Resurgent Capital Services, L.P.’s  subsequent request for the same relief is \nmoot, and the Court does not need further briefing on these Motions .  \n16 ECF No. 24.  Case 2:25-cv-00848-AMA-JCB     Document 35     Filed 11/05/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 3 of 94 \n Response to Motion to Strike on November 1, 2025.17 \nOn November 3, 2025, Plaintiff filed his Motion for Default Judgment.18 \nDISCUSSION  \n Defendant s ask  the Court to set aside the default certificate entered October 30, 2025. \nDefendant s also ask the Court to dismiss the action for insufficient process and insufficient \nservice of process or,  as Defendant Johnson Mark, LLC asks  in the alternative, to require \nPlaintiff to effectuate proper service in strict compliance with Rule 4. Defendant Johnson Mark, \nLLC has also moved to strike Plaintiff’s Opposition, and Plaintiff has moved for default judgment. The Court will address the issue of strikin g Plaintiff’s Opposition before turning to the \nparties’ other requests.  \nA. MOTION TO STRIKE  \nDefendant Johnson Mark, LLC asks the Court to exercise its discretion under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 12(f) to strike Plaintiff’s Opposition, which Defendant alleges was \ngenerated by artificial intelligence (“AI”) . Rule 12(f) allows the Court to strike certain matters \nfrom pleadings,\n19 but Plaintiff’s Opposition is not a pleading,20 and “there is no provision in the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure for motions to strike motions and memoranda[.]”21 Based upon \n \n17 ECF No. 27. While the time for filing a reply has not yet expired, the Court determines, as \nreply briefs are optional, that it need not wait for a reply brief before ruling on this Motion. \n18 ECF No. 28; see also  ECF Nos. 29–31. Because the Court sets aside default as to all \nDefendants and quashes service upon all Defendants, this Motion is moot, and the Court does not \nneed further briefing. \n19 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) (“The court may strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any \nredundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter.”). \n20 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a). \n21 Searcy v. Soc. Sec. Admin., 956 F.2d 278, at *2 (10th Cir. 1992) (unpublished table decision). Case 2:25-cv-00848-AMA-JCB     Document 35     Filed 11/05/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 4 of 95 \n this lack of authority, the Court denies  Defendant Johnson Mark, LLC’s request, but the Court \ndoes so without prejudice in the event that Defendant can point to another theory under which \nstriking Plaintiff’s Opposition would be authorized.  \nThe Court, however, does wish to make clear that the Court has serious concerns about \nthe allegations that Plaintiff’s Opposition contain s AI-hallucinated case quotations  and warns \nPlaintiff to refrain from any improper use of AI in the course of this litigation. To the extent that sanctions may be appropriate for this conduct, the issue can  be handled on the Rule 11 motion \nfor sanctions that Defendant Johnson Mark, LLC represented it served upon Plaintiff,\n22 provided \nthat Defendant moves forward with that motion in the future.  B. MOTIONS TO SET ASIDE DEFAULT CERTIFICATE AND MOTION FOR \nDEFAULT JUDGMENT  \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c), a “court may set  aside an entry of \ndefault  for good cause.” This “good cause” requirement is less exacting than what is required to \nset aside a default judgment.23 Courts may consider the following factors when determining \nwhether to set aside an entry of default: “ (1) whether the default was the result of culpable \nconduct of the defendant, (2) whether the plaintiff would be prejudiced if the default  should be \nset aside, and (3) whether the defendant presented a meritorious defense.”24 “The [C]ourt is not \n \n22 ECF No. 25. \n23 See Dennis Garberg  & Assocs.,  Inc. v. Pack -Tech  Int’l  Corp., 115 F.3d 767, 775 n.6 (10th Cir. \n1997) (“[I]t is well established that the good cause required by Fed R. Civ. P. 55(c) for setting \naside entry of default poses a lesser standard for the defaulting party than the excusable neglect which must be shown for relief from judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).”).  \n24 Hunt v.  Ford  Motor Co., 65 F.3d 178, at * 3 (10th Cir. 1995) (unpublished table decision). Case 2:25-cv-00848-AMA-JCB     Document 35     Filed 11/05/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 5 of 96 \n required to consider each of these factors, nor is it limited only to these factors.”25 “Underlying \nthe [C]ourt’s analysis is the recognition that ‘[ d]efault  judgments are disfavored by courts.’”26  \n Here, Defendant  Johnson Mark, LLC has shown that it was  served with a summons t hat \ndid not bear the Court’s seal nor the Clerk’s signature as required by Rule 4(a)(1)(F)–(G) and  \nRule 4(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.27 Plaintiff  admits that, while he obtained \nsigned and sealed summons es from the Court on September 25, 2025,28 the process server \nreceived unsigned copies of the se summons es.29 As such, the summons es the Defendants \nreceived w ere unsigned, unsealed, and consequently defective. Defects in  a summons “ are not \nmere technical defects  in service that can be amended, but rather are defects  that render service \nvoid.”30 “Such a shortcoming deprives this Court of personal jurisdiction over the Defendants.”31 \nAs the defects in the summons es render Plaintiff’s attempts at service voi d, Defendants  have not \nbeen  serv ed in this actio n as required under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4, and the Court \npresently lacks personal jurisdiction over Defendants. W hile Defendants may have had other \nnotice of this action,  their obligation to respond is triggered only by effective service.32  \n \n25 Arbor Wood Prods., Inc.  v. Pillar  Mach., LLC , No. 2:18- cv-875, 2019 WL 1099711, at *1 (D. \nUtah Mar. 8, 2019). \n26 Id. (quoting Polaski v.  Colo. Dep’t  of Transp., 198 F.

P. 12(a)(1)(A) (“A defendant must serve an answer: within 21 days after Case 2:25-cv-00848-AMA-JCB     Document 35     Filed 11/05/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 6 of 97 \n Thus, s etting aside  the default certificate as to all Defendants is necessary . Because \nDefendants were not effectively served, the default was not the result of their culpable conduct, \nand Defendants have the meritorious defense that process —and thereby service—was \ninsufficient. Moreover, Plaintiff will not be prejudiced by the Court setting aside the default , as it \nhas been revealed that Plaintiff was not in fact entitled to the default. Plaintiff also still has \nopportunity to properly serve the Defendants, which  will be discussed in greater detail below . \nThe Court therefore  grants Defendant Johnson Mark, LLC’s Motion to Set Aside Default and \nsets aside the entry of default as to all Defendants  as good cause for doing so has been \nestablished. Consequent ly, the Court denies as moot Defendants LVNV Funding, LLC and \nResurgent Capital Services, L.P.’s  subsequent request for the same relief. Plaintiff’s Motion for \nDefault Judgment is also  denied as moot.33 \nC. MOTIONS TO DISMISS  \nUnder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(4) and 12(b)(5), a “defendant may object \nto plaintiff ’s failure to comply with the procedural requirements for proper service set forth in or \nincorporated by Rule 4.”34 “A Rule 12(b)(4) motion  constitutes an objection to the form of \nprocess  or the content of the summons rather than the method of its delivery.”35 “A Rule \n \nbeing served  with the summons and complaint. . .” (emphasis added) ). \n33 See Borys v. Ballard, Case No. 2:24- cv-00794- RJS-JCB, 2025 WL 2814764 (D. Utah Oct. 1, \n2025) (denying as moot motion for default judgment when the court set aside the entry of \ndefault).  \n34 Moomey v. Express Messenger Sys., Inc. , No. 2:21- cv-00575- DAK-JCK, 2021 WL 5772268, \nat *2 (D. Utah Dec. 6, 2021) (citation omitted). \n35 Id. (citation omitted).

Nonethe less, \nthe Court believes that dismissal on this basis is premature at this  juncture. Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 4(m) provides that a plaintiff must serve a defendant “within 90 days after the \nComplaint is filed.”  Plaintiff filed the instant action on September 2 4, 2025. 90 days from \nSeptember 24, 2025, is December 23, 2025, which is several weeks away . Plaintiff thus still has \ntime under the procedural rules to effectuate service upon the Defendants . Accordingly, the \nCourt concludes that the proper remedy at present  is to quash the service upon all Defendants \nand to give Plaintiff opportunity to effectuate service in  compliance with Rule 4 .38 Defendant s’ \nMotions t o Dismiss  are therefore denied as moot.39 Defendants may,  if appropriate,  file motion s \nto dismiss addressing any grounds for dismissal, which may include service and process issues, \nat a later time.  \nORDER \n For the foregoing reasons, the Court HEREBY ORDERS as follows: \n \n36 Id.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Daniel and Hollie Parrish filed a lawsuit against various officials involved in an ongoing Child in Need of Services (CHINS) proceeding, alleging constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and other statutes. Their complaint was dismissed due to lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, sovereign/judicial immunity granted to the defendants, and principles of federal abstention. The court denied their subsequent motion to reconsider, finding no manifest error or newly discovered evidence presented.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court's dismissal of the Parrishes' claims against state officials and the Indiana Department of Child Services was justified based on sovereign and judicial immunity, lack of plausible claims under Section 1983, and the need for federal court abstention in ongoing state child welfare proceedings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion to reconsider its prior dismissal, affirming that the defendants were entitled to immunity, the claims were not sufficiently plausible, and abstention was appropriate due to ongoing state court proceedings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a family named the Parrishes doesn't like how a local court case about their kids is going, so they tried to get a federal court to step in. The federal court said, \"Sorry, we can't help because the people you're complaining about are shielded from this kind of lawsuit, you haven't given us enough reason to get involved, and we generally stay out of state family matters.\" When the Parrishes asked the court to think again, the court said, \"We already looked into it and we're sticking with our decision.\"",

For the following reasons, the Motion is denied . \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn March 5, 2025, the Parrishes initiated this action arising out of an ongoing Child in \nNeed of Services (\"CHINS\") proceeding in Jennings Circuit Court. The Parrishes named as \ndefendants the Indiana Department of Child Services (\"IDCS\"), its attorneys and Family Case \nManagers, Jennings Circuit Court Judges, and Guardians ad litem . The Court screened the original Case 1:25-cv-00429-TWP-TAB     Document 60     Filed 07/18/25     Page 1 of 7 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n Complaint and explained that the Complaint was subject to dismissal, in part, because it did not \ncontain sufficient factual allegations and because many of the Defendants were immune from the \nclaims against them (Dkt. 12). The Court gave the Parrishes leave to amend their complaint and \nshow cause why this action should not be dismissed for lack of subject -matter jurisdiction.  \nThe Parrishes filed an Amended Complaint  which added factual allegations, asserted \nclaims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (\"Section 1983\") and a variety of other statutes, sought injunctive relief pursuant to Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 441 (1908), and alleged several constitutional \nviolations. The Court screened the Amended Complaint  and concluded that the Parrishes' claims \nwere still subject to dismissal. The Court explained, in part, that Defendants , in their official \ncapacities,  are entitled to sovereign and/or judicial immunity to the Parrishes' claims f or monetary \nrelief, that the Parrishes did not assert any bona fide  claims against Defendants in their individual \ncapacities, and that several Defendants  are not suable under Section 1983 (Dkt. 46 at 8–10). The \nCourt also explained that despite the possibility of relief under Ex parte Young, the Court must \nabstain from exercising federal jurisdiction pursuant to the Younger abstention doctrine, domestic -\nrelations exception to federal jurisdiction, and general principles of federalism . Id. at 10 –13. The \nCour t gave the Parrishes a final opportunity to amend their complaint.  \nThe Parrishes filed their Second Amended Complaint on July 7, 2025, which  again  assert ed \nclaims under Section 1983 against IDCS, IDCS employees , and Guardians ad Litem, and a dded a  \nMonell  claim against IDCS and Jennings County (Dkt. 56) . On July 11, 2025, t he Court screened \nthe Second Amended Complaint, (Dkt. 57). The Court explained that the Second Amended \nComplaint continued to assert claims against Defendants who are entitled to sovereign and/or judicial immunity, that the Second Amended Complaint did not  allege a plausible Monell  claim, \nand, most importantly, that this case threatens to interfere with ongoing CHINS proceedings and Case 1:25-cv-00429-TWP-TAB     Document 60     Filed 07/18/25     Page 2 of 7 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n requires abstention. Id. at 2–3. The Court therefore dismissed this action without prejudice for lack \nof subject-matter jurisdiction and entered final judgment (Dkt. 57; Dkt. 58).  \nOn July 16, 2025, the Parrishes filed the instant Motion to Reconsider (Dkt. 59). No \nresponse from any Defendant is necessary , so the Court will proceed with ruling on the Parrishes' \nMotion.1  \nII. LE GAL STANDARD  \nThe Parrishes ask the Court to reconsider its dismissal of this action under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 59(e) (Dkt. 59). Rule 59(e) allows a court to amend a judgment only if the movant \ncan \"demonstrate a manifest error of law or fact or present newly discovered evidence.\" Lightspeed Media Corp. v. Smith, 830 F.3d 500, 505–06 (7th Cir. 2016) (internal citations omitted). A \"manifest error\" means \"the district court commits a wholesale disregard, misapplication, or failure to recognize controlling prece dent.\" Stragapede v. City of Evanston, 865 F.3d 861, 868 (7th Cir. \n2017) (internal quotation omitted). \"A manifest error is not demonstrated by the disappointment of the losing party.\" Oto v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 224 F.3d 601, 606 (7th Cir. 2000) (internal quotations omitted). Relief through a Rule 59(e) motion for reconsideration is an \"extraordinary remed[y] reserved for the exceptional case.\" Foster v. DeLuca, 545 F.3d 582, 584 (7th Cir. 2008). \nIII. DI\nSCUSSION  \nThe Parrishes argue the Court's dismissal was  erroneous because: (1) the Court misapplied \nsovereign and judicial immunity; and (2) the Parrishes  adequately alleged a Monell  claim . \nAs to their first argument, the Parrishes explain  that they \"do not seek monetary damages \nfrom the State of Indiana or the DCS as a state agency, but rather from individual DCS employees \n \n1 Non-movants are not always entitled to file response briefs to non- dispositive motions, including motions to \nreconsider. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not guarantee such a right, and although this Court's Local Rules \npermit response briefs, courts have broad discretion in enforcing, or not enforcing, their own local rules. Gray v. \nHardy , 826 F.3d 1000, 1005 (7th Cir. 2016). This Court therefore need not wait for any Defendant to respond before \nruling on the Parrishes' Motion to Reconsider.  Case 1:25-cv-00429-TWP-TAB     Document 60     Filed 07/18/25     Page 3 of 7 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n sued in their individual capacities under Ex parte Young . . . for ongoing constitutional violations.\" \n(Dkt. 59 at 3). The Court previously addressed the Parrishes' individual -capacity claims, finding \nthat based on the Parrishes' factual allegations and requested relief, those claims were not \"bona fide\" individual -capacity claims (Dkt. 46 at 8 –9). The Court also previously address ed the \nParrishes' claims for injunctive relief under Ex parte Young, finding that the Court must abstain from exercising jurisdiction over those claims ( assuming they are  viable) . Id. at 10 . The Parrishes \nalso assert that \"judicial immunity does not apply to acts taken outside the scope of judicial function, such as knowingly accepting perjured affidavits or executing unlawful removal orders,\" but they cite no authority supporting this statem ent (Dkt. 59 at 3).  \nThe Parrishes cite several cases from this Court and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals \nthat purportedly support their position that IDCS employees are not immune to suit. Id.  at 59. \nHowever, the  cited  Seventh Circuit cases do not support the Parrishes' position. See Doe v. Heck, \n327 F.3d 492, 508 n.13 (7th Cir. 2003) (\" To the extent the plaintiffs' suit against the defendants in \ntheir official capacities with the Bureau seeks retrospective monetary damages, this action constitutes a suit against the state  that is prohibited by the Eleventh Amendment.\"); Brokaw v. \nMercer County , 235 F.3d 1000, 1009 (7th Cir. 2000) (\" Federal suits against state officials in their \nofficial capacities are barred by the Eleventh Amendment  . . . .\"). And, after a thorough search,  it \nappears that the cited decisions from this  court—\"Smith v. Indiana Dept. of Child Services , No. \n1:15- cv-00123- JMS-MJD, 2016 WL 1070607, at *5–7 (S.D. Ind. Mar. 18, 2016)\" and \" Hernandez Case 1:25-cv-00429-TWP-TAB     Document 60     Filed 07/18/25     Page 4 of 7 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n v. Indiana Dept. of Child Services , No. 1:14- cv-00457- TWP -DKL, 2015 WL 13309206, at *3–5 \n(S.D. Ind. Mar. 24, 2015)\"—are either egregiously miscited or simply do not exist.2 \nAs to their second argument, the Parrishes contend that their Second Amended Complaint \nadequately alleged \"a pattern and practice by Indiana DCS\" sufficient to state a Monell  claim (Dkt. \n59 at 5). The Parrishes simply re- assert the factual allegations in their Second Amended Complaint \nand disagree with the Court's conclusion that those allegations are not enough to assert a plausible \nMonell claim. The Parrishes also cite and quote the Hernandez  and Smith  cases , but, as stated \nabove, those cases do not appear to exist. Id. \nMotions for reconsideration do not give a party the opportunity to rehash old arguments or \nto present new arguments or evidence \"that could and should have been presented to the district court prior to the judgment.\" Moro v. Shell Oil Co., 91 F.3d 872, 876 (7th Cir. 1996). Reconsideration is appropriate only when the Court has patently misunderstood a party or has made a decision outside the adversarial issues presented to the Court by the parties, or has made an error not of reasoning but  of apprehension. D avis v. Carmel Clay Sch. , 286 F.R.D. 411, 412 \n(S.D. Ind. 2012) (citing Bank of Waunakee v. Rochester Cheese Sales, Inc., 906 F.2d 1185, 1191 (7th Cir. 1990)). The Parrishes' Motion to Reconsider fails to identify any errors of \nmisapprehension, manifest error s of law or fact , or any newly discovered evidence. The Parrishes \nsimply  attempt to rehash old arguments that the Court considered in its screening entries, which \ndoes not warrant reconsideration of the Court's dismissal of their claims. \n \n2 This Court has recently admonished and sanctioned parties for submitting briefs containing miscited or non -existent \ncases.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas dismissed Gavin B. Davis's complaint against U.S. Pretrial Services officers, finding it frivolous and failing to state a claim for relief. The court noted Davis’s reliance on AI for legal research, which misguidedly supported claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, typically not applicable against federal actors like those involved here. There was also no credible factual basis for any alleged abuses of process or constitutional violations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's complaint stated a plausible claim for relief under various legal theories, including violations of the Administrative Procedures Act, constitutional rights, and other alleged procedural and substantive misconduct by pretrial services officers.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court accepted the magistrate judge's recommendation to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, citing the plaintiff's failure to articulate a viable legal claim. The court also denied the plaintiff's request to file an amended complaint, finding that further amendment would be futile.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: In this court case, a man named Gavin Davis sued some government officers because he thought they had treated him unfairly before his trial. His complaint was hard to understand, so the court decided it didn’t have any solid ground to stand on and threw it out. Davis used AI to help him with his legal research, but that led him to misunderstand the law. The court said that even if Davis tried to explain better, there wouldn’t be enough to change the outcome, so they closed the case for good.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nWESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS  \nSAN ANTONIO  DIVISION  \n \nGAVIN B. DAVIS ,1 \n Plaintiff s, \n \nv.                 Case No. 5:2 5-CV-0336-JKP -RBF  \n \nCHIEF OFFICER GINA FAUBION, U.S.  \nPRETRIAL SERVICES; AND OFFICER  \nKARLA RAMOS, U.S. PRETRIAL  \nSERVICES , \n Defendant s.  \n \nORDER  ACCEPTING REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nOF UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE  \n \nBefore the Court is a Report and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge  \n(ECF No. 8) (“R&R”) , filed on August 27 , 2025. Pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 \nU.S.C. § 1915(e), t he Magistrate Judge recommends that the Court dismiss the complaint with \nprejudice as frivolous and for Plaintiff’s failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  \nThe Magistrate Judge identifie s three claims from the “protracted, difficult -to-follow \nproposed Complaint”: (1) violations of the Administrative Procedures Act (“APA”), (2) abuse of \nprocess, and various forms of negligence. R&R at 4. The Magistrate Judge construe s the alleged \nnegligence claims as leading to the violation of various Constitutional rights and  further note s \nthat it appears that Plaintiff brings direct claims for violations of his constitutional rights.  Id. The \nMagistrate Judge identifie s requested relief as monetary damages, other damages, and declarato-\nry relief but recognize s the chief focus as obtaining a new pretrial services officer. Id.  \n \n1 Although the complaint lists H -Fin Capital Partners, LLC as a plaintiff, that entity has not paid any filing fee for \nthis action. And while t he Court has granted Plaintiff Gavin Davis permission to proceed in forma pauperis , that \npermission only applies to him, and it is black letter law that an entity cannot proceed without licensed counsel. See \nRowland v. Cal. Men ’s Colony , 506 U.S. 194, 201 -03 (1993) (per curiam) . The Magistrate Judge considered this \ncase to be only on behalf of the individual plaintiff. Because the individual plaintiff cannot litigate this case pro se \nand without prepayment of the filing fee as it relates to the entity listed as a plaintiff, the Court likewise treats this \ncase as only pursued by the individual plaintiff.  Case 5:25-cv-00336-JKP-RBF     Document 15     Filed 10/01/25     Page 1 of 62 \n As for the APA claim, the Magistrate Judge provide s authority for finding that Plaintiff \ncannot plausibly allege such a claim against staff members of the United States Pretrial Services, \nwhich operates under the supervision of the judiciary. Id. at 5. As for the other claims, the Mag-\nistrate Judge state s that the complaint is devoid of facts to support required elements and decline s \nto sift through the voluminous, difficult -to follow complaint. Id. The Magistrate Judge character-\nizes this action as an “attempt to collaterally attack or otherwise sidestep events in [Plaintiff’s] \ncriminal case.” Id. Finally, the Magistrate Judge found that it would be futile to permit Plaintiff \nto file a more definite statement in an attempt to more adequately plead his constitutional claims. \nId. at 6.  \nPlaintiff has filed purported objections to the R&R. See ECF No. 12. Because he agrees \nthat his original complaint is protracted and difficult to follow, he seeks an opportunity to file an \namended complaint. See id. ¶ 2. He surmises that he will be able to file an amended complaint \nthat is capable of surviving § 1915 dismissal  because he was able to survive dismissal in a differ-\nent case after being allowed to amend. Id. While Plaintiff regrets proceeding under the APA, he \ncontends that his research through artificial intelligence (“AI”) indicates that he can sue pretrial \nservices officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 or Bivens  while also recognizing that his research \nshows that such individuals are often protected by immunity. Id. ¶ 3.  \nAs another basis for filing an amended complaint, Plaintiff states that he is not bringing \nany direct claim for violations of constitutional rights, but the facts and allegations are construc-\ntive to his action and central to his claim against the pretrial officers. Id. ¶ 4. He further contends \nthat he would be able to meaningful address alleged abuses of process or constitutional claims in \nan amended complaint. Id. ¶ 7. Citing to a dissenting opinion from a dissenting opinion, Plaintiff \ncontends that he may  have a Fourth Amendment violation. Id. (citing United States v. Caceres , \n440 U.S. 741, 760 (1979) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (citing United States v. White , 401 U.S. 745, Case 5:25-cv-00336-JKP-RBF     Document 15     Filed 10/01/25     Page 2 of 63 \n 790 (1971) (Harlan, J., dissenting)). Plaintiff also submits that an amended complaint will not \nseek monetary damages. Id. ¶ 5. But he concedes “that collateral matters regarding the terms and \nconditions of pretrial release are under attack.” Id. ¶ 6.  \nWith respect to his alleged focus to obtain a new pretrial services officer, he submits that \nhe has filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 to address that matter. Id. ¶ 8. He disagrees that \nthe current lawsuit is an attempt to collaterally attack or otherwise sidestep events of his criminal \ncase. Id. ¶ 9. He also disagrees that an amendment would be futile. Id. ¶ 10. He asserts that he \nshould be able to obtain declaratory or other relief for alleged unlawful pretrial detention. Id. He \nasserts that unlawful conditions of release were imposed. Id. Relying on liberal construction af-\nforded pro se filings, he contends that he “can easily prove Abuse(s) of Process and Constitu-\ntional violations by the Defendants.” Id. ¶ 12.  \nPlaintiff views the Magistrate Judge’s declination to sift through his original complaint as \nfair. Id. ¶ 13. Thus, given the assertions and contentions of his objections, Plaintiff requests ei-\nther (a) an opportunity to amend his complaint to provide a more concise and well -pleaded com-\nplaint or (b) an opportunity to “borrow and pay” either the $55 administrative fee or the $405 \nfiling fee. Id. \nNotably, Plaintiff objections are short on actual objections to the R&R. And his requested \nrelief essentially concedes that he needs an amended complaint to survive a § 1915 analysis. The \nCourt will not consider Plaintiff’s proposal to borrow and pay any part of the required fees for \npursuing a civil action in federal court. This case has proceeded beyond that point.  \nAs for the request to amend, the Magistrate Judge preemptively stated that it would be fu-\ntile to allow Plaintiff an opportunity to expand upon the allegations of his complaint. Plaintiff has \nnot shown that statement to be clearly erroneous or contrary to law. Instead, he relies on his own \nsubjective belief that an amendment will survive § 1915 scrutiny. Such a subjective belief is in-Case 5:25-cv-00336-JKP-RBF     Document 15     Filed 10/01/25     Page 3 of 64 \n sufficient to obtain leave to amend a pleading.  \nPlaintiff’s objections also reveal reliance on AI  research . While use of this developing \ntool for legal research is not of itself necessarily problematic, the Fifth Circuit requires litigant -\nusers of AI, even pro se litigants, to “verify the accuracy of AI -generated information.” Garces v. \nHernandez , No. 25 -50342, 2025 WL 2401001, at *2 (5th Cir. Aug. 19, 2025) (per curiam), pet. \ncert. filed , 2025 WL 2401001 , No. 25 -5558 (Sept. 4, 2025). A recent Standing Order from our \nsister court in the Northern District of Texas provides a thorough overview regarding the litigant -\nuse of AI  that transcends the local rules of that court. See Willis v. U.S. Bank Nat ’l Ass’n as Tr., \nIgloo Series Tr. , 783 F. Supp. 3d 959 (N.D. Tex. 2025) .  \nFrom his AI research, Plaintiff relies on a dissenting opinion that itself cites to another \ndissenting opinion . While dissenting opinions may prove useful in legal research, they do not \nprovide binding, definitive statements of law that of themselves justify an amendment. The AI \nresearch also suggests a possible claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 even though that statute has no \napplicability to the federal actors sued in this case. In potential recognition of that fact, Plaintiff \nalso generically mentions “ Bivens ,” which refers to Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of \nFederal Bureau of Narcotics , 403 U.S. 388 (1971) , a case that has been described as “‘in es-\nsence’ the federal counterpart to § 1983, which applies to state officials acting under color of \nstate law,” Abate v. S. Pac. Transp. Co. , 993 F.2d 107, 111 (5th Cir. 1993). His AI research also \nrecognizes that pretrial services officers may be entitled to immunity for their actions, but Plain-\ntiff makes no effort to address why immunity would not render asserting a Bivens  claim futile.  \nFurthermore, Plaintiff’s proposed Bivens  claim relates to alleged unlawful conditions of \nrelease and Plaintiff has made no showing that Bivens  applies to such an alleged constitutional \nviolation. Even when a plaintiff has named individuals who may be proper Bivens  defendant s, as \nhere,  the plaintiff must identify a constitutional violation that could plausibly entitle him to relief Case 5:25-cv-00336-JKP-RBF     Document 15     Filed 10/01/25     Page 4 of 65 \n against the named defendants. See Robbins v. U .S. Prob. Off. for Dist. of Minniapolis , No. 20 -\nCV-1918 -LRR, 2021 WL 1255402, at *4 (D. Minn. Mar. 18, 2021)  (recognizing that the plaintiff \nintended to sue probation office for the District of Minnesota) , aff’d sub nom. Robbins v. U .S. \nProb. Off., Dist. of Minn ., No. 21 -1740, 2021 WL 4472670 (8th Cir. July 2, 2021).  \nPlaintiff concedes that his APA claim was ill -advised and subject to dismissal. Caselaw \nsupports that concession. See id. He has also filed a subsequent habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2241 in recognition that some claims for relief fall within habeas litigation rather than a typical \ncivil action. Despite his conclusory assertions within his objections, Plaintiff has not presented \nfactual allegations to state a plausible claim against the named defendants for abuse of process or \nany constitutional violation. And to the extent he might seek to pursue a claim of negligence \nagainst the named defendants, such a claim would necessarily fail. See Valenta v. BI Inc. , No. \nCV 20 -912, 2021 WL 3081902, at *5 (W.D. Pa. Apr. 1, 2021) (recommendation of Mag. J.) \nadopted  by 2021 WL 3080147 (W.D. Pa. July 21, 2021) .  \nWhether to grant leave to amend is within the Court ’s sound discretion. U.S. ex rel. \nWillard v. Humana Health Plan of Tex. Inc. , 336 F.3d 375, 387 (5th Cir. 2003).  While courts \nshould provide an opportunity to amend before dismissing an action, l eave to amend is not re-\nquired  when plaintiffs have already pled their “best case.”  See Brewster v. Dretke , 587 F.3d 764, \n768 (5th Cir. 2009) (per curiam).  In this case, Plaintiff has provided no reason for the Court to \nbelieve that he has not pled his best case.  He provides no  factual allegations within his objections \nto state a plausible claim that warrants leave to amend.  \nFinding no error upon a de novo  review of those portions of the recommendation to \nwhich objection was made and reviewing the remaining portions for clear error, the Court AC-\nCEPTS  the Report and Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge  (ECF No. 8), filed \non August 27, 2025. It DISMISSES  this action with prejudice under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) as rec-Case 5:25-cv-00336-JKP-RBF     Document 15     Filed 10/01/25     Page 5 of 66 \n \nommended  and will finalize such dismissal with a separate judgment dismissing this case. Fur-\nther, f or the reasons stated herein , the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to file an amended com-\nplaint.  \nIt is so ORDERED  this 1st day of October  2025. \n \n \nJASON PULLIAM  \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  Case 5:25-cv-00336-JKP-RBF     Document 15     Filed 10/01/25     Page 6 of 6",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this court case, defendants Neal Scott Stone and Keely Logsdon are charged with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and distribution of controlled substances. The jury is given preliminary instructions, including the duty to judge the facts based on evidence presented in the trial. The instructions explicitly warn jurors against using external sources, including artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet, to gather information or assist in their decision-making process, highlighting the potential impact of AI on the case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants conspired to distribute controlled substances and whether they knowingly distributed such substances.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: As this is a preliminary jury instruction document, there is no holding in the document itself. The purpose of the document is to guide the jury on their duties and the legal framework under which they will evaluate the evidence presented during the trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Two people are on trial because the government says they worked together to sell illegal drugs. The jury, which is a group of regular people, listens to all the stories, looks at the evidence, and decides if the two people really did what they're accused of. The judge tells the jury they must only use information from the courtroom to decide, meaning they can’t search the internet or use things like AI to help them figure it out.",
    "full_text": "1UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY\nLOUISVILLE DIVISION\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff,\nv. Criminal Action No. 3:23 -cr-80-DJH\nNEAL SCOTT STONE (1) and\nKEELY LOGSDON (2), Defendants.\n*  *  *  *  *\nPRELIMINARY JURY INSTRUCTIONS\nMembers of the jury: Now that you have been sworn, I will give you some preliminary \ninstructions to guide you in your participation in the trial.\nI. DUTY OF THE JURYIt will be your duty to find from the evidence what the f acts are.  You and you alone will \nbe the judges of the facts.  You will then have to apply to those facts the law as the Court will \ngive it to you.  You must follow that law whether you agree with it or not.\nNothing the Court may say or do during the course of the trial is intended to indicate, or \nshould be taken by you as indicating, what your verdict should be.II. EVIDENCEThe evidence from which you will find the facts will consist of the testimony of \nwitnesses; documents and other things received into the record as exhibits; and any facts that the \nlawyers agree to or stipulate to or that the Court may instruct you to find.\nCertain things are not evidence and must not be considered by you.  I will list them for \nyou now.\n(1) Statements, arguments, and questions by lawyers are not evidence.\nSep 16, 2025Case 3:23-cr-00080-DJH     Document 195     Filed 09/16/25     Page 1 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n  (2) Objections to questions are not evidence.  Lawyers have an obligation to their \nclients to make objections when they believe evidence being offered is improper under the rules \nof evidence.  You shou ld not be influenced by the objection or by the Court’s ruling on it.  If the \nobjection is sustained, ignore the question.  If it is overruled, treat the answer like any other.  If \nyou are instructed that some item of evidence is received for a limited pur pose only, you must \nfollow that instruction.  \n (3) Testimony that the Court has excluded or told you to disregard is not evidence \nand must not be considered.  \n (4) Anything you may have seen or heard outside the courtroom is not evidence and \nmust be disregar ded.  You are to decide the case solely on the evidence presented here in the \ncourtroom.  \n There are two kinds of evidence: direct and circumstantial.  Direct evidence is direct \nproof of a fact, such as testimony of an eyewitness.  Circumstantial evidence i s proof of facts \nfrom which you may infer or conclude that other facts exist.  I will give you further instructions \non these as well as other matters at the end of the case, but keep in mind that you may consider \nboth kinds of evidence.  \n It will be up to y ou to decide which witnesses to believe, which witnesses not to believe, \nand how much of any witness’s testimony to accept or reject.  I will give you some guidelines for \ndetermining the credibility of witnesses at the end of the case.  \nIII. RULES FOR CRIMI NAL CASES  \n As you know, this is a criminal case.  There are three basic rules about criminal cases that \nyou must keep in mind.  Case 3:23-cr-00080-DJH     Document 195     Filed 09/16/25     Page 2 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n  First, the defendant s are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  The indictment brought \nby the government against the defendant s is only an accusation, nothing more.  It is not proof of \nguilt or anything else.  The defendant s therefore start out with a clean slate.  \n Second, the burden of proof is on the government until the very end of the case.  The \ndefendant s have no burden to prove their innocence, or to present any evidence, or to testify.  \nSince the defendant s have the right to remain silent, the law prohibits you from arriving at your \nverdict by considering that a defendant may not have testified.  \n Third, the g overnment must prove the defendant s’ guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  I will \ngive you further instructions on this point later, but bear in mind that in this respect a criminal \ncase is different from a civil case.  \nIV. SUMMARY OF THE CASE  \n In this case, th e defendant s are charged with conspiracy to distribute controlled \nsubstances and distribution of controlled substances .  I will give you detailed instructions on the \nlaw at the end of the case, and those instructions will control your deliberations and dec ision.  \nBut in order to help you follow the evidence, I will now give you a brief summary of the \nelements of the offense s that the government must prove to make its case.  \n To prove that the defendants conspired to distribute controlled substances, the \ngove rnment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt:  \n First, that two or more persons conspired, or agreed, to  distribute controlled substances;  \n Second, that the defendant s knew of the conspiracy and its goals ; and \n Third, t hat the defendant s joined the conspirac y with the intent that at least one of the  \nconspirators  engage in distribution of controlled substances.  Case 3:23-cr-00080-DJH     Document 195     Filed 09/16/25     Page 3 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n  To prove that the defendants distributed controlled substances, the government must \nprove beyond a reasonable doubt:  \n First, that the defendants knowi ngly distributed the controlled substance; and  \n Second, that t he defendant s knew at the time of distribution that the substance was a  \ncontrolled substance . \nV. CONDUCT OF THE JURY  \n Now, a few words about your conduct as jurors.  \n You, as jurors, must decide this case based solely on the evidence presented here within \nthe four walls of this courtroom.  This means that during the trial you must not conduct any \nindependent research about this case, the matters in the case, and the individuals or corporati ons \ninvolved in the case.  In other words, you should not consult dictionaries or reference materials ; \nsearch the Internet, websites, or blogs ; or use any other electronic tools , including artificial \nintelligence (known as AI), to obtain information about this case or to help you decide the case.  \nPlease do not try to find out information from any source outside the confines of this courtroom.  \n Until you retire to deliberate, you may not discuss this case with anyone, even your \nfellow jurors.  After you ret ire to deliberate, you may begin discussing the case with your fellow \njurors, but you cannot discuss the case with anyone else until you have returned a verdict and the \ncase is at an end.  \n I know that most of you use cell phones, the Internet , and other to ols of technology.  You \nalso must not talk to anyone at any time about this case or use these tools to communicate \nelectronically with anyone about the case.  This includes your family and friends.  You may not \ncommunicate with anyone about the cas e using  your cell phone, iPhone, email, text messaging, \nor Twitter (or X) ; or through any blog , website,  or app,  including Facebook, LinkedIn, Case 3:23-cr-00080-DJH     Document 195     Filed 09/16/25     Page 4 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n Instagram, Threads, Snapchat, TikTok, or YouTube .  You may not use any similar technology of \nsocial media, even if I have not specifically mentioned it here.  I expect you will inform me \nimmediately if  you become aware of another juror’s violation of these instructions.  A juror who \nviolates these restrict ions jeopardizes the fairness of these proceedings, and a mistrial could \nresult, which would require the entire trial process to start over.  \n Finally, do not form any opinion until all the evidence is in.  Keep an open mind until you \nstart your deliberatio ns at the end of the case.  \n I hope that for all of you this case is interesting and noteworthy.  \n If you want to take notes during the course of the trial, you may do so.  However, it is \ndifficult to take detailed notes and pay attention to what the witness es are saying at the same \ntime.  If you do take notes, be sure that your note -taking does not interfere with your listening to \nand considering all of the evidence.  Also, if you do take notes, do not discuss them with anyone \nbefore you begin your deliberat ions.  Do not take your notes with you at the end of the day —be \nsure to leave them in the jury room.  \n If you choose not to take notes, remember that it is your own individual responsibility to \nlisten carefully to the evidence.  You cannot give this respons ibility to someone who is taking \nnotes.  We depend on the judgment of all members of the jury; you all must remember the \nevidence in this case.  \nVI. COURSE OF THE TRIAL  \n The trial will now begin.  First, the government will make an opening statement, which is \nsimply an outline to help you understand the evidence as it comes in.  Next, the defendants ’ \nattorney s may, but do not have to, make opening statement s.  Opening statements are neither \nevidence nor arguments.

Following the government’s case, the defendant s may, if they wish , present \nwitnesses whom the government may cross -examine.  After all the evidence is in, the attorneys \nwill present their closing arguments to summarize and interpret the evidence for you, and the \nCourt will instruct you on the law.  After that, you will retire to deliberate on your verdict.  Case 3:23-cr-00080-DJH     Document 195     Filed 09/16/25     Page 6 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Ruben Santoyo appealed the denial of his motions to reinstate a lawsuit against the City of Chicago and two officers who arrested him without probable cause, claiming judicial misconduct. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's denial, dismissing Santoyo's assertions as frivolous and warning him of potential sanctions due to baseless claims. The case involves artificial intelligence, as Santoyo used an AI program that generated non-existent legal citations, forming part of the basis for denying his post-judgment relief.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the district court erred in denying Santoyo's motions to vacate judgment based on alleged irregularities and misconduct in the judicial process, and whether the use of non-existent AI-generated legal citations impacts the integrity of legal proceedings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Seventh Circuit Court affirmed the district court's denial of Santoyo’s Rule 60(b) motions, ruling that the claims were unsupported by evidence and did not meet the exceptional circumstances required under Rule 60(b). The court also emphasized that the use of AI to generate fictitious citations was inappropriate and could lead to sanctions.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone was caught red-handed on camera doing something wrong, like stealing cookies, and then later, they said the police wrongly arrested them without proof. They also claimed the judge was biased against them. Not only did they fail to show any real evidence for their claims, but they even made up fake law books as their backup using a computer program that invents things. The higher court told them their reasons made no sense and warned them to stop making stuff up, or they could get fined.",

Because Santoyo ’s motions were frivolous , as is this appeal,  we affirm.  \n Santoyo was arrested for battery in July 2020 by officers Kevin Sodja and Isai \nJunes. Almost two years later, he brought this suit, alleg ing that the officers arrested \n \n* We have agreed to decide the case without oral argument because the appeal is frivolous. F ED. \nR. APP.

P. 32.1 Case: 24-2352      Document: 38            Filed: 07/07/2025      Pages: 3No. 24-2352  Page 2 \n \nhim without probable cause in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, see 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and state law. T he defendants later moved  for summary judgment . After  oral \nargument, the district judge  granted the motion, ruling that no reasonable jury could \nfind that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest Santoyo. \n Two days later, Santoyo filed two motions to set aside the judgment under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) . In his  first motion, Santoyo asserted that he had \nobserved unspecified “irregularities suggesting judicial conflict of interest and \nmisconduct ,” and that he had “substantial evidence suggesting that the presiding \njudge’s impartiality may have been compromised.” In his  second motion, Santoyo \ncontended that the judgment should be set aside because neither party was put under oath before arguing the summary judgment motion.  \n The judge  denied both motions , conclud ing that the y contained nothing more \nthan vague assertions  that failed to satisfy Rule  60(b)’s requirement of “ exceptional  \ncircumstances.” She further  observed that Santoyo’s accusations of judicial misconduct  \nwere “utterly baseless” —continuing  a trend of  baseless accusations by Santoyo \nthroughout the litigation. The judge  also  noted  that  Santoyo had cited two non- existent \ncases,  presumably generated by an artificial intelligence  program that he had \nacknowledged using in p ast filings . The judge  warned Santoyo that he  could  be \nsanctioned if he  continued to make baseless accusations of judicial misconduct  or if he \nsubmitted other fictitious  authority. \n Santoyo appealed and while that appeal was pending the district court \nsanctioned him for reasons unimportant to this order. We review  that sanctions order in \na precedential opinion also issued today.\n1 \nSantoyo challenges the denial of his Rule 60(b) motions ,2 but these challenges are \nfrivolous . First, he  reasserts that the judgment must be vacated because the parties were \nnot under oath when arguing the summary judgment motion . But a s the district judge  \ncorrectly ruled , the parties  did not need to be placed under oath before making legal \n \n1 The sanctions order resulted in a filing bar being imposed against Santoyo in the district court , \nand he informs us that the Northern District of Illinois’s Clerk’s Office is now rejecting his submissions to \nthe district court docket in this case. He correctly observes that the Executive Committee exempted from \nthe filing bar any case that existed before the filing bar was imposed. The Clerk’s Office is direct ed to \naccept Santoyo’s filings on the district court docket in this case.  \n \n2 Santoyo’s original notice of appeal also challenged the  underlying order granting summary \njudgment and the judgment itself, but he has since clarified in a “ notice  of correction ” that he seeks to \nchallenge only the denial of his Rule 60(b) motions.  Case: 24-2352      Document: 38            Filed: 07/07/2025      Pages: 3No. 24-2352  Page 3 \n \narguments ; the statements of attorneys are not evidence . See Renard v. Ameriprise Fin. \nServs., Inc., 778 F.3d 563, 569 (7th Cir. 2015). Second, Santoyo contends that he provided “detailed accounts” of judicial misconduct and conflicts of interest  and that the judge \ndid not sufficiently  substantiate her ruling. But the judge  rightly  rejected Santoyo’s \nallegations  because he provided no  evidence to support them , much less evidence \nsufficient to c all into doubt the court’s impartiality, see United States v. Walsh , 47 F.4th \n491, 499–500 (7th Cir. 2022), or show the extraordinary  circumstances required for rel ief \nunder Rule  60(b), see Word Seed Church v. Vill age of Homewood , 43 F.4th 688, 690 (7th Cir. \n2022). To the extent Santoyo argues that the judge’s threat of sanctions suggests  bias, he \nis mistaken . Even a pro  se litigant like himself  must verify that the authority he submits \nis accurate , F\nED. R. CIV. P. 11(b), and a judge ’s threat to enforce that rule with sanctions  \ndoes not hint of bias , see In re City of Milwaukee , 788 F.3d 717, 722–23 (7th Cir. 2015) \n(threat of sanctions  for “non -starter arguments” did not suggest bias ).3  \nOur determination that Santoyo’s appeal is frivolous does not automatically \njustify sanctions in our court , Dolin v. GlaxoSmithKline LLC , 951 F.3d 882, 888 (7th Cir. \n2020), but we are persuaded that they are warranted here.  We recently warned Santoyo  \nin a separate appeal , also frivolous,  that future frivolous appeals may result in \nsanctions. Santoyo v. Village  of Oak Lawn , No. 24-2051, 2024 WL 4930393, at *2 (7th Cir. \nDec. 2, 2024). And a year before that warning, in a matter relating to this case, we denied as frivolous Santoyo ’s petition for a writ of “supervisory control” concerning \nrecusal of the district judge and warned him that further frivolous petitions may result in sanctions.  In re Ruben Santoyo , No. 23-3048 (7th Cir. Oct. 31, 2023). What’s more, we \ndenied Santoyo’s  request in this appeal to proceed in  forma  pauperis, concluding that \nhe had not made any “ potentially meritorious argument.” Santoyo v. City of Chicago , \nNo. 24-2352 (7th Cir. Sept. 20, 2024). And despite the district judge’s warning that he \ncould be sanctioned for submitting additional filings with irrelevant citations, the \nauthorities he cites in his opening brief in our court do not at all support the \npropositions he advances.  \nIn short , this appeal is frivolous. Santoyo is ordered to show cause within  14 \ndays why he should not be subject to sanctions  imposed by our court, including an \norder to pay the appellee s’ fees and costs. See F\nED. R. APP. P. 38. \nAFFIRMED  \n \n3 In his reply brief, Santoyo for the first time raises other arguments  concerning  alleged \nprocedural irregularities . But a rguments raised for the first time in a reply brief are waived, Bradley v. \nVillage  of Univ ersity  Park , 59 F.4th 887, 897 (7th Cir. 2023) , and so we do not address  them.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Darren Smith filed a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, arguing that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) improperly denied him time credits under the First Step Act. The court dismissed his petition due to his failure to exhaust all administrative remedies before seeking court intervention. Notably, the case mentions that Smith's reply brief might have been drafted by an artificial intelligence large language model, which potentially affected the strength of his arguments.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Smith was required to exhaust all administrative remedies available through the BOP before filing a habeas corpus petition in federal court.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Smith's petition must be dismissed because he did not exhaust the administrative remedies required by the BOP system, nor did he adequately demonstrate any exceptions to the exhaustion requirement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Darren Smith is in prison and thought he should get some time off his sentence for good behavior and completing certain programs. But, before you can ask a judge for help with this type of complaint, you have to follow certain steps through the prison's own system first. Darren didn't do that, so the judge said they couldn't help him until he tried all the options available within the prison system. Also, some of Darren's paperwork might have been written by a computer program, which didn't help his case.",
    "full_text": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA  \n \nDARREN SMITH ,  : CIVIL ACTION NO. 1:25 -CV-1236 \n   : \n  Petitioner : (Judge Neary)  \n   : \n v.  : \n   : \nWARDEN OF FCI -SCHUYLKILL,  : \n   : \n  Respondent : \n \nMEMORANDUM  \n \nThis is a habeas corpus case filed under  28 U.S.C. § 2241 . Petitioner, Darren \nSmith , argues that the United States Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) has improperly \ndenied him time credits under the First Step Act (“FSA”). The petition will be \ndismissed for Smith’s  failure to exhaust administrative remedies . \nI. Factual Background & Procedural History  \n \nSmith  is serving a 240 -month criminal sentence imposed by the United States \nDistrict Court for the Western  District of New York . (Doc. 5-2 at 2). He is housed in \nSchuylkill Federal Correctional Institution  (“FC I-Schuylkill”).  \n Smith’s  petition arises from the FSA, which  allows eligible inmates who \nsuccessfully complete “evidence- based recidivism reduction programs” (“EBRRs”) \nor productive activities (“PAs”) to receive earned time credits to be applied toward \ntime in pre -release custody or supervised release. 18 U.S.C. § 3632(d)(4)(A). An \ninmate may earn ten days of credit for every thirty days of successful participation. \nId. Inmates who have been assessed at a minimum or low risk of recidivism who do Case 1:25-cv-01236-KMN-LT     Document 7     Filed 09/29/25     Page 1 of 4 \n2 not increase their risk of recidivism over two consecutive assessments may earn an \nadditional five days of credit for every thirty days of successful participation. Id.    \nSmith’s  petition  asserts that the BOP has improperly refused to apply time \ncredits he has earned under the FSA to his sentence. ( Id.) Respondent responded to \nthe petition on August 8 , 2025, arguing that Smith  failed to exhaust administrative \nremedies , that his claim otherwise fails on its merits , and that his claim is not yet \nripe.  (Doc. 5). Smith  filed a reply brief in support of his petition on  August 25 , 2025, \nmaking the petition ripe for review. (Doc. 6). II. Di\nscussion   \n Although there is no explicit statutory exhaustion requirement for Section \n2241 habeas petitions, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has consistently held that exhaustion applies to such claims. Callwood v. Enos, 230 F.3d \n627, 634 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing Schandelmeier v. Cunningham , 819 F.2d 52, 53 (3d Cir. \n1986)); Moscato v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 98 F.3d 757, 760 (3d Cir. 1996). \nExhaustion allows the agency to develop a factual record and apply its expertise, conserves judicial resources, and provides agencies the opportunity to “correct their own errors” thereby fostering “administrative autonomy.” Id.  at 761 -62. The \nBOP has a specific internal system through which federal prisoners can request \nreview of nearly any aspect of their imprisonment. See 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.10- .19. That \nprocess begins with an informal request to staff and progresses to formal review by \nthe warden, appeal with the regional director, and —ultimately —final appeal to the \ngeneral counsel. Id.  §§ 542.13- .15. No admin istrative remedy is considered fully \nexhausted until reviewed by the general counsel. Id.  § 542.15(a). Case 1:25-cv-01236-KMN-LT     Document 7     Filed 09/29/25     Page 2 of 4 \n3  Exhaustion is the rule in most cases, and failure to exhaust will generally \npreclude habeas review. Moscato , 98 F.3d at 761. Only in rare circumstances is \nexhaustion of administrative remedies not required. For example, exhaustion is \nunnecessary if the issue presented is one that consists purely of statutory construction. Vasquez v. Strada, 684 F.3d 431, 433- 34 (3d Cir. 2012) (citing Bradshaw \nv. Carlson , 682 F.2d 1050, 1052 (3d Cir. 1981)). Exhaustion is likewise not required \nwhen it would be futile. Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 516 n.7 (1982).  \n Respondent argues that Smith’s  petition should be dismissed for failure to \nexhaust administrative remedies because he did not appeal his relevant  \nadministrative remedy requests through all stages of the BOP’s administrative \nremedy process. (Doc. 5 at 7-10). Respondent provides evidence of Smith’s  failure to \nappeal his administrative remedy requests. (Doc. 5- 5). Smith  does not address this \nevidence in his reply brief, other than stating in conclusory fashion that the \nadministrative remedy process should be disregarded as futile because he received \nresponses to his grievances that were for “explanation only . . . with no substantive \nrelief.”  (Doc. 6 at 2). Smith’s reply brief also argues in conclusory fashion that his \ncontinued incarceration would constitute irreparable harm and that the exhaustion doctrine for Section 2241 habeas petitions is prudential and may be excused in \ncertain situations. Smith does not provide any factual support for any of these arguments.\n1 \n \n1 It appears that Smith’s reply brief may have been drafted by an artificial \nintelligence large language model (“LLM”) and that the prompt given to the model \nto generate the brief contained few, if any, facts from Smith’s particular case. Case 1:25-cv-01236-KMN-LT     Document 7     Filed 09/29/25     Page 3 of 4 \n4  Smith’s unsupported and conclusory arguments are not sufficient to excuse \nexhaustion of administrative remedies . To the extent Smith is arguing that \nexhaustion would be futile because the BOP is likely to rule against him,  the \nadministrative remedy process is not rendered futile “simply because a prisoner \nanticipates he will be unsuccessful in his administrative appeals.” Williams , 2024 \nWL 4204277, at *2 (quoting Ross v. Martinez, No. 4:09 -CV-1770, 2009 WL 4573686, at \n*3 (M.D. Pa. Dec. 1, 2009 ))). The peti tion will accordingly be dismissed for failure to \nexhaust administrative remedies  because Smith  has not completed the BOP’s \nadministrative remedy process and no exceptions to the exhaustion requirement apply .\n2 \nIII. Conclusion   \n The petition for writ of habeas corpus is dismissed for failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies . An appropriate order shall issue.  \n       \n       /S/ KELI M.

Neary  \n      United States District Judge  \n      Middle District of Pennsylvania  \n \nDated:  September 29, 2025  \n \n2 The court does not address respondent’s alternative arguments regarding \nthe merits  and ripeness  of the petition.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves a decision by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut concerning debtor Deborah Ann Mitchell. The court grants a motion by Wells Fargo Bank for relief from the automatic stay, allowing the bank to proceed with foreclosure on Mitchell's property, as her repeated bankruptcy filings have been deemed a scheme to delay creditors. The opinion also addresses the unauthorized use of artificial intelligence in preparing legal documents, with the court noting inaccuracies and fictitious legal references in Mitchell's AI-assisted filings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the debtor's bankruptcy filing should continue to halt foreclosure proceedings and if the debtor's filings, prepared with AI assistance, have complied with procedural rules.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court grants Wells Fargo's motion for relief from the automatic stay, allowing foreclosure proceedings to continue. The court also orders that due to the debtor's misuse of AI-generated filings, which contained fictitious legal citations, all future documents submitted by the debtor must include complete copies of cited cases.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're watching a game where a referee (the court) has to decide if a player (Deborah Ann Mitchell) can keep using a timeout (the automatic stay) to stop the game (the foreclosure) from continuing. The referee sees that the player keeps calling timeouts to delay the game unfairly, so they say the game can go on. Also, the player was using a robot helper (AI) to make her playbook (legal papers), but the robot made up some plays that didn’t exist, so now whenever the player wants to use the robot, she has to show a full picture of each play to the referee to make sure it's real.",

(the \"Movant\") filed and \nserved upon Deborah Ann Mitchell (the \"Debtor\") a motion seeking relief from the \nautomatic stay, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(1) and (d)(4).  ECF No. 14 (the \"Motion\").   \nMovant holds a note and mortgage on certain real property allegedly owned by the Debtor \nand commonly known as 290 Tuthill Street, West Haven, Connecticut (the \"Property\").  See, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., v. Ronald B. Mitchell AKA Ronald Benjamin Mitchell, et al ., \nConnecticut Superior Court Case No. NNH -CV22 -6121488- S (the \"Foreclosure Case\").  \nPursuant to this C ourt's contested matter procedure the Debtor was required to file \nany response to the Motion on or before September 26, 2025.  Local Bankr.R. 9014-1 ; \nSee also ECF No. 14, p. 11 (providing notice to the Debtor of this deadline).  The Debtor \ndid not timely file an objection to the Motion, nor has the Debtor timely sought an extension of time to file a response, pursuant to Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9006(b).  The Debtor’s numerous responses to the Motion (including ECF Nos. 19 , 20, 21, 22, 28, 31, 32, and \n36) may be disregarded for untimeliness .  See Local Bankruptcy Rule 9014- 1(f).  Although \nthe self -represented Debtor’s filings were untimely, and a hearing was not required, the \nCase 25-30757    Doc 40    Filed 11/05/25    Entered 11/05/25 08:36:26     Page 1 of 10Page 2 of 10 Court nevertheless set the Motion for hearing in order to provide the self -represented \nDebtor an opportunity to be heard.  \nThe original hearing on the Motion was scheduled for October 15, 2025.  ECF No. \n24.  However, the Debtor requested a continuance of the hearing (ECF No. 28) in order \nto formulate a reply  to the Movant’s October 8, 2025, Response (ECF No. 26) to her \nObjection.  The Court granted the Debtor’s request and continued the hearing to October 22, 2025, at 10:00 A.M.  ECF No. 29.   Between the date the Motion was filed and the date \nof this Order, the Debtor filed at least 10 documents styled as affidavits, totaling over 100 \npages in length, asserting various arguments.  \nStanding \nThe Court concludes the Movant has standing to seek relief from the automatic \nstay set forth in 11 U.S.C. § 362(a) for two reasons.  First, the Movant established it has standing to enforce the note and mortgage which form the basis for the debt owed by the Debtor by including a copy of the note and mortgage and a declaration (executed by the Movant's vice president of loan documentation Tonya Caldwell) which certifies the Movant possesses the original note and that the attached copy is a true and accurate copy thereof.  ECF No. 14 p. 18. \nSecond, a final judgment of foreclosure entered in the Foreclosure Case.  \nForeclosure Case Doc. 166.  The existence of this final judgment by the State Court also \nserves as a determination as to the Movant’s standing to enforce the note and mortgage.  \nPursuant to the Rooker -Feldman doctrine, the Bankruptcy Court cannot act as an \nappellate court for the Foreclosure Case.  Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co. , 263 U.S. 413 \n(1923) ; District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman , 460 U.S. 462 (1983).

City of New York , \n910 F.3d 639, 644 (2d Cir. 2018).  For Rooker -Feldman to apply to the Foreclosure Case, \nfour requirements must be met .  First, the party opposing the judgment or result in the \nForeclosure Case (here, Ms. Mitchell) must have lost in state court.  Second, Ms. Mitchell \nmust complain of injuries caused by the state -court judgment .  Third, Ms. Mitchell must \ninvite federal court review and rejection of the Foreclosure Case judgment .  And, fourth,  \nthe state- court judgment must have been rendered before the federal court proceedings \ncommenced.\" Sung Cho, 910 F.3d at 645.  \nHere, the Debtor’s arguments with respect to the Movant’s standing fall squarely \nwithin the four corners described in Sung  Cho.  This court’s review of the result in the \nForeclosure Case is barred under the Rooker -Feldman doctrine.  The state courts have \nalready determined the Movant has standing to enforce the note and mortgage in the \nForeclosure Case .  Indeed, the only question remaining in the Foreclosure Case at this \ntime appears to be when the foreclosure sale will take place.  The  Bankruptcy Court \ncannot now serve as an appellate court to review that determination.  Smith v. Bendett & McHugh, P.C. , No. 3:22 -cv-239 (JAM), 2023 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10792, at *6- 10 (D.

Gregor , 220 F.3d 81, 92 (2d Cir. 2000)) .   \nBased on the timing and filing of these three bankruptcy cases , the Court draws \nthe inference the serial filings are part  of a scheme to hinder  and delay  the creditor without \ncause.   \nAs detailed above, i t is well- settled that bankruptcy courts do not have jurisdiction \nto review the final judgments of state courts.  See In re Cody, Inc ., 281 B.R. 182, 189 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2002), aff'd  in part, appeal dismissed in part, 338 F.3d 89 (2d Cir. 2003) \n(determining that the bankruptcy court could not disturb the final order of a state court regarding a tax debt) (citing Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413 (1923)).   Ms. \nMitchell argues here – as she and Mr. Mitchell argued in the first case, and as Mr. Mitchell \nalone argued in the second case –  that there are procedural and substantive problems \nwith the judgment in the Foreclosure Case.  But, the state court judgment is final and the bankruptcy court cannot alter that.  \nEach of the two prior cases affecting the Property were dismissed, in essence, due \nto a refusal by the debtors to participate in the bankruptcy process in good faith.  Case \nCase 25-30757    Doc 40    Filed 11/05/25    Entered 11/05/25 08:36:26     Page 6 of 10Page 7 of 10 No. 23- 30450, ECF No. 117 pp. 11- 12; Case No. 24-31009 , ECF No. 84 p. 4.  This case \ndoes not appear to be any different.  As detailed further below, the Debtor has filed \nvoluminous papers in this case advancing legal theories which are unsupported by the law, rely upon fictitious authority, and which appear to be solely for the purpose of causing undue delay.   \nBased on this record the court concludes the Debtor filed this petition as part of a \nscheme to delay, hinder, or defraud creditors involv ing either a transfer of ownership of  \nthe Property  or multiple bankruptcy filings affecting the Property , within the meaning of \n11 U.S.C. § 362(d)(4).  Accordingly, the Movant is entitled to in rem  relief regarding the \nProperty  for a period of two years.  \nFed.R.Bankr.P.  9011  \nFed.R.Bankr.P. 9011 provides every paper filed with the Court, including those \nfiled by self -represented parties must (1) not be filed for an improper purpose ; and  (2) be \nsupported by existing law and/or non- frivolous arguments.  Fed.R. Bankr .P. 9011(b).  \nWhen a party does not comply with Rule 9011, the Court is empowered to order \nthat party to show cause why  conduct specifically described in the order has not violated \nRule 9011.  Fed.R. Bankr .P. 9011(c)(3).  \n\"Although pro se litigants should be afforded latitude, they generally are required \nto inform themselves regarding procedural rules and to comply with them.\" In re Blonder , \n47 Fed. Appx. 605, 606 (2d Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (quoting LoSacco v. City of Middletown , 71 F.3d 88, 92 (2d Cir.1995)).  \nAs applicable here, the Debtor has filed numerous papers which appear to have \nbeen generated by , or with the assistance of , artificial intelligence (“A.I.”).  See e.g. ECF \nCase 25-30757    Doc 40    Filed 11/05/25    Entered 11/05/25 08:36:26     Page 7 of 10Page 8 of 10 Nos. 22 p. 11 (Including what appears to be unedited prefatory response language from \nan A.I. program);  36 p. 2 (Specifically attesting that ECF No. 36 was prepared with A .I. \nassistance).  Although there is no rule prohibiting the use of artificial intelligence when \npreparing documents or performing research, parties are still required to certify the \naccuracy of all papers.  As relevant here, the Court is unable to locate numerous cases \nrelied upon by the Debtor  and several  cases which could be found are inaccurately \nquoted.  \nBecause it appears the Debtor’s filings were prepared with A .I. assistance, and \nbecause the Debtor is self -represented, the Court attempted to caution the Debtor \nregarding her responsibilit y under Rule 9011 to verify the accuracy of any papers she files \nwith the Court .1  At the October 22, 2025, hearing on the Motion, when asked, the Debtor \nacknowledged she used an A .I. program “for formatting” her various filings, and stated \nshe did not check the legal citations relied upon in the filing.  However, the Debtor later \nstated she does her own legal research.  The Debtor was then provided with a courtesy \ncopy of the District Court’s September 12, 2025, Notice to Counsel and Litigants Regarding A .I.-Assisted Research  (the “Notice”).  The Notice clearly states there is a \nzero-tolerance policy for A .I. hallucinations in filings  – including filings by self -represented \nparties  – and that a failure to verify the accuracy of submissions will be construed as a \nviolation of Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 (or Fed.R.Bankr.P 9011 as applicable in bankruptcy) and “will often result in sanctions absent reasonable excuse.”  \n \n1 The Court also notes a similar pattern occurred in Ronald Benjamin Mitchell’s  2024 Chapter 11 \ncase .  Case No. 24- 31009, ECF No. 54 pp. 2- 3. \nCase 25-30757    Doc 40    Filed 11/05/25    Entered 11/05/25 08:36:26     Page 8 of 10Page 9 of 10 Subsequently, the Debtor filed a  sworn  affidavit (ECF No. 36) accusing the Court \nof fabricating the September 12, 2025, Notice after the fact, and generally repeating her \nprior arguments relating to the Movant’s standing.  \nNotably, ECF No. 36 states  the Debtor: “ reviewed the drafted document, made  \ncorrections to ensure accuracy, and swore to its truthfulness under penalty of law before  \nsigning it .”  However, the affidavit filed as ECF No. 36 also contains several cases which \nappear to be fictitious  A.I. hallucinations and cannot be located by the Court .   \nThe Debtor’s persistent reliance upon fictitious authority is not without harm.  The \nCourt (and presumably t he Movant) has spent  substantial  time reviewing the Debtor’s \nvoluminous filings and legal theories which are ultimately frivolous and unsupported by \nthe law.  This naturally results in needless legal fees for the Movant, and for the Court this \nresults in a diminishment of resources to address other bankruptcy cases.   \nFurther, the Debtor’s numerous filings also twist and misconstrue the facts of this \ncase.  With respect to ECF No. 38, the Debtor asserts in a sworn statement the Court \nimproperly ordered her to appear at a continued hearing on October 22, 2025, at 2:00 \nP.M., and that the Court then pretended not to have done so as a means of “berating” and inte ntionally misleading her due to some preconceived prejudice against the Debtor \nECF No. 38 p. 2- 4.  However, this is far from the truth.  \nAt the conclusion of the 10:00 A.M. hearing on the Motion, the Court announced it \nwould reserve decision on the Motion, that the morning hearing calendar was concluded, \nand that the Court would be in recess until 2:00 P.M., when the afternoon hearing calendar was scheduled to commence.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this court case, Pamela Williams, the debtor, filed a motion to strike unauthorized pleadings on the grounds that attorney John Taylor Weitz had not made a proper appearance, thus his clients lacked standing. The court found that Weitz did indeed comply with local rules by filing responses, and the remedy for improper appearance is not to strike pleadings but to prevent representation at trial, which was moot as the case was dismissed. Notably, the case involved an AI-related issue where the debtor cited a non-existent case seemingly due to an AI \"hallucination,\" raising concerns about relying on generative AI for legal references.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the attorney John Taylor Weitz made a proper appearance in the bankruptcy case and whether his clients had standing to participate, and the impact of AI \"hallucinations\" in legal citations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that John Taylor Weitz had made a proper appearance as per local rules, and the clients had standing as proper respondents. Further, the debtor's Motion to Strike was denied, including her failed attempt to argue based on a nonexistent case citation attributed to an AI \"hallucination.\"\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Imagine you have a debate team, and one of the members—let's call him John—didn’t properly sign up before the competition. Someone then claims John's team shouldn’t be allowed to participate, but the rules say that just responding in writing is enough to join. Now, imagine if you said, “According to a famous rule, John’s team can’t compete,” but it turns out that rule never existed, and you might’ve gotten it from a computer that made it up. The court said, “Sorry, John's team can stay, and use real sources next time!”",

See  Doc. 104, the \n“Order”).  In the Motion  to Strike , Debtor asked the Court to strike from the record \npleadings and arguments presented by attorney John Taylor Weitz , arguing that Mr. Weitz \nnever made a proper appearance in the case because he did not file a notice of appearance  \n_______________________________________________________________IT IS ORDERED as set forth below:\n_____________________________________ \nLisa Ritchey Craig \nU.S. Bankruptcy Court JudgeDate: October 30, 2025\nCase 24-62693-lrc    Doc 107    Filed 10/30/25    Entered 10/30/25 10:50:53    Desc Main\nDocument      Page 1 of 42 \n and, without a proper appearance, Mr. Weitz’ clients (the “Clients”) lacked standing and \ntheir participation was unauthorized .  In the Order, the Court reasoned that , under the \nCourt’s local rule, Mr. Weitz had made a proper appearance by filing a written response to \nDebtor's Amended Motion to Reinstate and Extend the Automatic Stay  (Doc. 19, the \n“Motion to Reinstate”) and the  Debtor’s Motion for Reconsideration  (Doc. 54 , the “Motion \nto Reconsider” ).  And, even if he had not  done so, the remedy under Federal Rule of \nBankruptcy Procedure 9010(b) for failure to make a proper appearance is not to strike \npleadings filed or arguments made after the fact, but to bar the attorney “ from representing \nthe party at trial or in any other proceeding, ”  BLR 9010- 4(a), and no further matters were \npending in this case , which stands dismissed .  Accordingly, the Court denied the Motion.  \nOn October 24, 2025, Debtor filed a  motion to reconsider the Order (Doc. 106, the \n“Motion”).  In the Motion, Debtor argues that the Court should have struck the pleadings \nand arguments made by Mr. Weitz  because the Clients  lacked standing and were not parties \nin interest , within the meaning of § 1109(b) of the Bankruptcy Code ,1 when they appeared  \nin opposition to the  Motion to Reinstate and the  Motion to Reconsider.  Debtor asserts that \nonly entities that have a “title interest” or a secured claim, or who appear on the creditor \nmatrix are  entitled to notice and to participate in a bankruptcy  case.2  That is not the law.  \n \n1  In this Chapter 13 case, § 1109(b)’s definition of “party in interest” does not, technically, apply.  See 11 U.S.C. § \n1109(b) (“A party in interest, including the debtor, the trustee, a creditors' committee, an equity security holders' \ncommittee, a creditor, an equity security holder, or any indenture trustee, may raise and may appear and be heard on \nany issue  in a case under this chapter .”) (emphasis added).  \n2 For authority on this point, Debtor cites White v. Bank of America,  291 Ga. 367 (2012).  The Court was unable to \nlocate this case.  The citation appears to be incorrect and, perhaps, is the product of an artificial intelligence \n“hallucination. ”  See In re Martin , 670 B.R. 636, 649 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2025) ( stating that “ blindly relying on \ngenerative AI and citing fake cases ” violated Bankruptcy Rule 9011 “ and will be sanctioned” ; sanctioning lawyer and \nhis law firm $5,500); In re Richburg, 671 B.R. 918, 919 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2025); In re Ford , Case No. 25 -57617 -SMS, \nCase 24-62693-lrc    Doc 107    Filed 10/30/25    Entered 10/30/25 10:50:53    Desc Main\nDocument      Page 2 of 43 \n Debtor sought imposition of a stay for the purpose of preventing the C lients  from regaining  \npossession of property in which they asserted an ownership  interest.  Regardless of whether \nDebtor added them to the creditor matrix, t hey were proper respondents to the Motion to \nReinstate and the Motion to Reconsider and, as such, were entitled to appear and protect \ntheir property interest .  A defendant need not establish standing.  In re Moore, 2018 WL \n1057834, at *5 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. Feb. 26, 2018).  Debtor has fa iled to raise any basis upon \nwhich the Court could reconsider the  Order.  \nIn the Motion, Debtor also requests a declaration that a foreclosure sale of Debtor’s \nproperty was void ab initio  as having been conducted in violation of the automatic stay. \nAlthough Debtor acknowledges in the Motion that no automatic stay arose in this case, pursuant to § 362(c)(4), Debtor argues that the Court erred when it refus ed to impose a stay \nand, had such a stay been imposed, it would have had retroactive effect.  In this regard, \nDebtor essentially requests reconsideration of the Court’s order ent ered on February 12, \n2025 (Doc. 51, the “Stay Denial Order”), which Debtor  appealed on February 24, 2025 \n(see Doc. 63).  As the appeal remains pending, this Court lacks jurisdiction to reconsider \nthe Stay Denial Order .  See In re Wylie, 664 B.R. 351, 356 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2024)  \n(noting that it would lack authority to rule on a Rule 9024 motion that was filed after a \ntimely notice of appeal was filed ); In re Baldwin , 2024 WL 4378990, at *1 (Bankr. D.

See Doc. 83 \n(noting that, during the hearing on the Motion to Extend, Debtor “acknowledged that, if the Court granted the Motion \nfor Stay, imposition of the stay would come too late to ‘undo ’ the foreclosure sale”).  Further,  the statute is clear that \na stay imposed under § 362(c)(4) is not retroactive.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Latino Clark filed a consumer credit lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase Bank, SG of Westlake (incorrectly identified as Serpentini Chevrolet), and Michigan Recovery Services, over the purchase and subsequent repossession of a Chevrolet Corvette. The court denied Clark's motion to strike SG of Westlake's amended affirmative defenses, citing the absence of compliance with procedural rules and the non-specific nature of his claims. The opinion highlights the court’s concern about the potential use of artificial intelligence by Clark in his legal research, which may have led to erroneous citations and claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's motion to strike the amended affirmative defenses filed by the defendant, SG of Westlake, is valid and supported by substantive legal arguments.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the plaintiff’s motion to strike, finding it frivolous and unsupported by specific legal arguments. Additionally, the court required the plaintiff to show cause for his failure to comply with procedural rules and attend the motion hearing, and pointed out potential sanctions due to inaccuracy and procedural noncompliance, possibly exacerbated by reliance on AI-generated content.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A man named Latino Clark bought a car and had a legal issue after it was taken back by the dealership. He tried to get the court to ignore what the dealership’s lawyer said to defend themselves. However, the court said no because he didn’t follow the rules or give clear reasons. The judge also thought he might be using a computer program to help find cases that weren’t real, which isn't allowed. The judge gave Clark a chance to explain himself before deciding if he needs to pay for the other side’s costs from this misunderstanding.",

Background  \nOn April 25, 2025, Latino Clark (“Plaintiff”) initiated this consumer credit \nlawsuit in pro per concerning the purchase of a Chevrolet Corvette from Serpentini \n \n1 Defendant Serpentini Chevrolet’s June 3, 2025 filing explains that Defendant SG \nof Westlake, LLC was “incorrectly identified in the Complaint as ‘Serpentini Chevrolet, Inc.’[.]”  (ECF No. 29, PageID.97.)  Case 4:25-cv-11195-SDK-APP   ECF No. 47, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 08/19/25   Page 1 of 82 \n Chevrolet with financing by Chase Auto, the subsequent repossession of the \nvehicle by Michigan Recovery Services (MRS), and a sale scheduled for April 21, \n2025. (ECF No. 1, ¶¶ 9-16.) ( See also ECF No. 1-1 [Retail Installment Sale \nContract].)   \nB. Prior Order  Regarding Responsive Pleadings  \nJudge Kumar has referred this case to me for all pretrial matters.  (ECF No. \n6.)  On June 25, 2025, the Court entered an order (ECF No. 39), denying Plaintiff’s \nJune 18, 2025 motions (ECF Nos. 33, 34, 35 & 37) regarding Defendant Serpentini \nChevrolet’s (i.e., Defendant SG of Westlake’s) and Defendant Michigan Recovery \nServices’ May 2025 answers and affirmative defenses (ECF Nos. 15, 16 & 26).   As \nreflected in that order, SG of Westlake’s May 2025 answer and affirmative defenses (ECF Nos. 15, 16) were amended on June 3, 2025 (ECF No. 29).    \nC. Instant  Motion s \nCurrently before the Court is Plaintiff’s June 27, 2025 motion (ECF No. 40) \nto strike Defendant SG of Westlake ’s amended affirmative defenses  (see ECF No. \n29-1).\n2  SG of Westlake ’s July 11, 2025 response (ECF No. 42) was timely under \n \n2 Defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank’s June 10, 2025 motion to dismiss (ECF No. \n30) – as to which a response (ECF No. 36)  and a reply (ECF No. 41)  have been \nfiled – will be addressed under separate cover .  Although Plaintiff filed a sur-reply \n(ECF No. 45) , it is, hereby, STRICKEN , because the Court did not authorize one.  \nAs the Undersigned’s practice guidelines explain :  “The Court adheres to E.D. \nMich LR 5.1 and 7.1 regarding format, length, and form of motions and briefs, and \nthe type of briefs required and permitted.  Additional briefing, including sur -Case 4:25-cv-11195-SDK-APP   ECF No. 47, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 08/19/25   Page 2 of 83 \n E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(e)(1)( A).  Plaintiff’s reply was due on or about July 18, 2025.  \nSee E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(e)(1)(B) .  Without filing a motion for extension of this \ndeadline, Plaintiff filed a reply on July 31, 2025.  (ECF No. 44 .)  Upon \nconsideration, the Clerk of the Court is DIRECTED to strike Plaintiff’s reply \n(ECF No. 44) as tardy.3   \nOn August 18, 2025, I conducted an in person motion hearing ( see ECF No. \n43), at which Attorneys Nicholas J. Ranke (for Defendant SG of Westlake)  and \nEmily L. Burdick (for Defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) appeared.   \nNotwithstanding the Clerk of the Court sending a copy of the notice of hearing to \nPlaintiff on July 21, 2025 ( see text-only certificate of service), Plaintiff did not \nappear on August 18, 2025.  To give Plaintiff the benefit of the doubt, the Court \nwaited twenty (20) minutes past the time set for hearing, after which it proceeded \nwith the hearing  and issued its ruling from the bench. \n   \n \nreplies, will NOT be permitted unless requested by the Court.  The Court will \nstrike any improperly filed sur -replies or other briefing not contemplated by the \nLocal Rules. ”  See www.mied.uscourts.gov .   \n \n3 On August 12, 2025, SG of Westlake filed a motion (ECF No. 46) to strike the \nreply (ECF No. 44)  as untimely; however, the Court notes that the certificate of \nservice does not certify that a copy of the order was mailed to the Plaintiff at his \naddress (see ECF No. 46, PageID.370), and P laintiff is not an electronic filer .  In \nany event, because the Court already has stricken the brief sua sponte  as \nunauthorized, Defendant SG of Westlake’s motion (ECF No. 46) is DENIED AS MOOT.  \n Case 4:25-cv-11195-SDK-APP   ECF No. 47, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 08/19/25   Page 3 of 84 \n D. Order  \nUpon consideration of the motion  papers  and counsels’ arguments and \nrepresentations at the hearing, and for all the reasons stated on the record by the \nCourt, which are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully restated herein, \nPlaintiff’s motion (ECF No. 40) is DENIED  and found to be frivolous .  In \nparticular, the Court notes several, general observations about Plaintiff’s motion, including:  \n• It does not certify compliance with E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(a) (“Seeking \nConcurrence in Motions and Requests.”).  \n \n• Neither Plaintiff’s motion to strike nor his related reply includes a \n“wet signature,” i.e., these filings are only signed “/s/Latino Clark,” and the signature is unaccompanied by a date ( see ECF No. 40, \nPageID.313; ECF No. 44, PageID.360-361), and neither filing is accompanied by a certificate of service to indicate it was served upon Defendants by U.S Mail consistent with Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d)(1)(B).  \nFrom here forward, Plaintiff SHAL L:  (1) sign his filings by hand \nconsistent with Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(a), unless he applies for and \nreceives permission to become an e -filer; (2) date his signatures; and, \n(3) attach certification of proper service by mail upon Defendants.  \n \n• There are difficulties with many of Plaintiff’s case citations, such as \nreferences to citations that do not exist – e.g., “United States v. \nProvident Bank , 2021 WL 1985046, at 2 (E.D. Mich. May 18, 2021),” \n“Gibson v. Rosati , 2017 WL 1155765 (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2017),” \n“Jones v. TransUnion LLC , 2022 WL 407915 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 10, \n2022),” – or to a case that does not address the principle for which it is \ncited – e.g., Beaudry v. TeleCheck Servs., Inc. , 579 F.3d 702 (6th Cir. \n2009) .  As to these observations, the Court suspects sloppy legal \nresearch or the use of artificial intelligence (which the court discourages for this reason) and reminds Plaintiff that Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) (“Representations to the Court”) requires accuracy in matters filed with this Cour t.     Case 4:25-cv-11195-SDK-APP   ECF No. 47, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 08/19/25   Page 4 of 85 \n  \nThe Court also notes several observations about the substance of Plaintiff’s \nmotion, such as:  \n• It seeks to strike “all affirmative defenses,” (ECF No. 40, PageID.313 \n¶ 1); yet, it fails to provide any individualized basis for striking the \nbulk of the defenses, and, in several instances where the motion was \nspecific, it mentions  affirmative de fense s not actually pleaded  by \nDefendant SG of Westlake  in the amended affirmative defenses at \nissue (see ECF No. 29 -1), e.g., “statute of limitations,” “intervening \nacts,” “collateral source,” “good faith,”  “waiver,”  etc.  Thus, \nPlaintiff’s characterization of  Defendant SG of Westlake’s affirmative \ndefenses as “boilerplate” ( see ECF No. 40, PageID.310) is off the \nmark; rather, the Court observes that it is Plaintiff’s own motion to \nstrike  that is largely boilerplate.  \n \n• To the extent Plaintiff challenges Defendant SG of Westlake’s assertion that the complaint “fails to state a claim” (Affirmative Defense No. 1) ( see ECF No. 29- 1, PageID.105) as lacking “factual \nspecificity” ( see ECF No. 40, PageID.311) , the Court refers back to its \nJune 25, 2025 order (ECF No. 39) regarding Defendant SG of Westlake’s initial, May 27, 2025 affirmative defenses (ECF No. 16)  \nand reiterates what is stated in the previous order, namely, that “claims and defenses within the pleadings are ordinarily tested and \nexplored via dispositive motion practice ” and motions to strike “‘are \nviewed with disfavor and are not frequently granted.’”   (ECF No. 39, \nPageID. 308-309) (quoting Bommarito v. Equifax Information Servs. , \nLLC, 340 F.R.D. 566, 568 -569 (E.D. Mich. 2022) (internal citations \nomitted) ).  \n \n• To the extent Plaintiff challenges the “legal impossibility of several \ndefenses,” based on his claims under the federal consumer protection statutes and the state fraud statutes ( see ECF No. 40, PageID.311-\n312), Plaintiff pleads causes of action against SG of Westlake based \non the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) (15 U.S.C. §§ 1601, et seq .) \n[Count 3] and conversion  [Count 6] and violation of Michigan’s \nConsumer Protection Act (MCPA) (Mich. Comp. Laws § 445.903) \n[Count 8], and declaratory relief  (28 U.S. C. § 2201) [Count 9 ] (see \nECF No. 1, PageID.2 -4 ¶¶ 20 -37).  As such, his argument that Case 4:25-cv-11195-SDK-APP   ECF No. 47, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 08/19/25   Page 5 of 86 \n “assumption of risk” and “contributory negligence” – and perhaps \neven “unclean hands”  – are “tort defenses, not applicable to statutory \nviolations under 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681n and 1681o[,]” ( ECF No. 40, \nPageID.312), are unavailing.  Conversion is an intentional tort.   \n \n• To the extent Plaintiff argues that affirmative defenses must, but did \nnot meet the level of “factual  particularity” required by Bell Atlantic \nv. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 (2007) and Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 550 U.S. 662 \n(2009) for complaints, the supporting case cited by Plaintiff (U.S. v. \nProvident Bank ) does not appear to be retrievable  or existent, either \nby using the citation supplied by Plaintiff or by looking it up by case name (in either Westlaw or Lexis) .\n4  In any case,  as this Court found \nin Reliable Carriers v. Moving Sites, LLC , No. 17 -cv-10971, 2018 \nWL 9963862, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Sept. 21, 2018)  (Grand, M.J.) , \n“‘affirmative defenses should not be stricken for failure to satisfy the Twombly/Iqbal standard’” in the absence of “‘clear direction from the  \nfrom the Sixth Circuit . . . .’” (quoting  Int’l Outdoor, Inc. v. City of \nSouthgate , No. 2:11-CV- 14719, 2012 WL 2367160, at *9 (E.D. Mich. \nApr. 26, 2012) (Komives, M.J.) (surveying cases) , report and \nrecommendation adopted , No. 11- 14719, 2012 WL 2367170 (E.D. \nMich. June 21, 2012) (Rosen, C.J.) .  \n \n \n \n4 The Court believes it likely that Plaintiff used Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) in his \nresearch.   “At this point, it ‘ is no secret that generative AI programs are known to \n‘hallucinate’ nonexistent cases, and with the advent of AI, courts have seen a rash \nof cases in which both counsel and pro se  litigants have cited such fake, \nhallucinated cases in their briefs. ’”  Seither & Cherry Quad Cities, Inc. v. Oakland \nAutomation, LLC , No. 23 -11310, 2025 WL 2105286, at *1 (E.D. Mich. July 28, \n2025)  (Behm, J.) (quoting Sanders v. United States , 176 Fed. Cl. 163, 169 (2025) ).  \nAI chatbots “are designed to mimic patterns of words, probabilistically.  When \nthey are ‘right, ’ it is because correct things are often written down in the dataset \nthey were trained on, not because they can independently fact-check themselves in the same way a human would. ”  Id.  This is a very risky practice, as pro se  litigants \nand attorneys are still subject to the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2) with \nrespect to pleadings, motions and other documents they sign and submit to the \nCourt, and, even in the absence of bad faith, Rule 11 sanctions for use of AI \ngenerated phantom cases may be warranted.   See id. at *2 (awarding sanctions).  Case 4:25-cv-11195-SDK-APP   ECF No. 47, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 08/19/25   Page 6 of 87 \n • To the extent Plaintiff challenges Defendant SG of Westlake’s \nassertion that Plaintiff “failed to mitigate his damages” (Affirmative \nDefense No. 6) ( see ECF No. 29- 1, PageID.106)  as inapplicable “to \nstatutory liquidated damages or punitive damages under FCRA[,]” (see ECF No. 40, PageID.312), Plaintiff does not bring his FCRA \ncause of action (Count 2 ) against Defendant SG of Westlake , i.e., he \nonly brings the FCRA claim against Chase Auto.  \nAdditionally, it is a waste of the Court’s and defense counsel’s time when  \nPlaintiff asks the Court to strike a filing and does not appear for the related, noticed \nhearing.  Given Plaintiff’s failure to appear in my courtroom on August 18, 2025 \nand my finding that his motion to strike (ECF No. 40) is frivolous, no later than \nFriday, August 29, 2025, Plaintiff SHALL  show cause, in writing, as to:  (1) why \nhe did not appear  for the hearing ; (2) why he did not seek concurrence with \ndefense counsel prior to filing his motion to strike (ECF No. 40) , as required by  \nE.D. Mich. LR 7.1 ; and, (3)  why he should not have to pay Defendant SG of \nWest lake’s costs and expenses as a sanction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f) for having \nto respond to the motion and appear for oral argument on August 18, 2025.   \nFailure to timely respond to this order to show cause may result in dismissal \nof this case.   \nFinally , no later than Friday, August 29, 2025, Defendant SG of West lake \nSHALL file a status report, clarifying whether it intends to file a motion to dismiss \nor proceed with discovery , after which the Court will enter either a briefing \nschedule or a scheduling order .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied Defendant Leon Miller's motion to recuse or reassign the district judge, which was filed under the notion of ensuring a neutral and constitutional adjudication. The court found that the allegations and arguments made by Miller, seemingly drafted with generative artificial intelligence, failed to meet the legal standard for questioning the judge's impartiality and were deemed frivolous as they misrepresented case laws and facts.\n   \n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, warranting recusal or reassignment under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a) based on the Defendant’s claims.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Defendant's motion for recusal was denied because the reasons provided were frivolous and not grounded in relevant or applicable law. The allegations failed to meet the objective test for questioning the judge's impartiality as set out in relevant precedents.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: The court was asked to change the judge because the defendant felt the judge might not be fair. The court reviewed the reasons, found them baseless, and decided that since there was no good reason to think the judge couldn't be fair, there was no need to change the judge. The court noted that the defendant’s arguments seemed to be written by an AI tool, which made several mistakes like using the wrong rules and citing cases incorrectly.",

The motion is denied.  \n Section 455(a) provides that a judge “shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which \nhis impartiality might reasonably be questioned.”  Impartiality is judged objectively:  “Would the \naverage person, knowing the facts alleged by the part[y] seeking di squalification, question the \nJudge’s impartiality, and, if so, would that question be reasonable?”  O’Bannon v. Union Pac. R.R. \nCo., 169 F.3d 1088, 1091 (8th Cir. 1999).  Stated differently, the test is “whether the judge’s \nimpartiality might reasonably be  questioned by the average person on the street who knows all the \nrelevant facts of a case.”  Moran v. Clarke , 296 F.3d 638, 648 (8th Cir. 2002) (quoting In re Kan. \nPub. Employees Ret. Sys. , 85 F.3d 1353, 1358 (8th Cir. 1996)).  If this test is not satisfied, judges \nhave a duty to decide the cases and controversies that come before them.  See Perkins v. Spivey , \n911 F.2d 22, 28 (8th Cir. 1990).  “Frivolous and improperly based suggestions that a judge recuse \nshould be firmly declined.”  Maier v.

Like his other filings, his motion appears to \nhave been drafted using generative artificial intelligence.  Many of his points are wrong, rely on \nirrelevant case law, or quote  language that appears nowhere in the cited opinions.  For example, \nDefendant ’s insistence that he  relied exclusively on § 1443(1) as the basis for removal  is untrue .  \nHe titled his Notice of Removal as a “Notice of Removal Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1441, 1443(1), \nand 1446.”   And, a s grounds  for removal, he state s, “This case is removable under 28 U.S.C. § \n1441(a) as a civil matter over which this Court would have original jurisdiction.”  ECF No. 1 at 1.   \nMoreover, ruling against a party does not constitute a reason for recusal.  \n Accordingly,  \n IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant’s Motion to Recuse or Reassign District \nJudge to Ensure Neutral and Constitutional Adjudication of Civil Rights Removal under 28 U.S.C. \n§1443(1) is  DENIED .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Todd E. Glass, representing himself, sued the law firm Foley & Lardner LLP for legal malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, and vicarious liability in federal court. He claims the diverse citizenship of parties justifies federal jurisdiction, which Foley & Lardner disputes, asserting that attorney Adam Schurle, a Minnesota resident, nullifies diversity. Glass's reliance on possibly AI-generated citations led the court to caution him on verifying accuracy, reflecting concerns over AI's role in legal proceedings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether complete diversity of citizenship exists between the parties, Todd E. Glass and Foley & Lardner LLP, which is necessary for federal diversity jurisdiction.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court mostly denied Glass's motion for broad jurisdictional discovery but allowed limited discovery to specifically determine the status of Attorney Adam Schurle’s partnership and his role in Foley & Lardner, which impacts the determination of jurisdiction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Glass is suing his old law firm in a federal court because he claims they messed up his previous case. To have the case in federal court, both parties need to be from different states. The law firm's argument is that one of their partners lives in the same state as Glass, which means they can't go to federal court. Glass asked for a lot of information to prove this isn't the case, but the court said no that's too much, but allowed him to ask a few simple questions instead. Additionally, Glass needs to be careful using AI to find legal cases because AI can sometimes make up fake cases, which misleads the court.",

Glass bring s only state-\nlaw claims, and he alleges that  the requirements for this court’s diversity jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1332 are met  because  he and defendant are citizens of different states and that more \nthan $75,000 is in controversy.  Defendant moves to dismiss  under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1), contending  that the parties are both citizens of Minnesota for purposes of \ndiversity jurisdiction .  Dkt. 13.  Glass seeks leave to conduct limited discovery to confirm  \ndefendant’s citizenship  before the court rules on defendant’s motion.   Dkt. 23 & Dkt. 25.1   \n \n1 The court has been unable to verify several cases Glass relies upon in his initial motion for \ndiscovery.  Dkt. 23 at 3.  For example, Glass cites to S.G. v. SafeSport , 74 F.4th 864, 870 (7th \nCir. 2023), but that case does not appear to exist.  Glass also cites to Cafasso v. Central \nRefrigerated Servs., Inc. , 486 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1084 (W.D. Wis. 2007), but no such case exists \nin this district, and the reporter information does not yield another case.  As for Cressey v. Hamilton , No. 21 -CV-2031 (D. Kan. 2021), that case number in the District of Kansas is \nassociated with Starr Homes, LLC v. Schlup, et al.   These cases do not appear in Glass’s amended \nmotion.  See Dkt. 25.  If Glass relied on generative artificial intelligence tools to draft his \noriginal motion, he should be aware of those tools’  tendency to “hallucinate” false case citations \nand of the need to carefully verify the materials he submits to the court.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n11(b)(2) (requiring a party to certif y that its “legal contentions are warranted by existing law \nor by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for \n Case: 3:24-cv-00769-jdp     Document #: 32     Filed: 11/04/25     Page 1 of 7   \n \n2 \n The court addressed these related motions at the April 11, 2025 preliminary pretrial \nconference , and stayed discovery pending resolution of Glass’s motion.  Dkt. 24.  Specifically, \nthe court noted that discovery is not unlimited , and that jurisdictional discovery typically \nentails a limited subset of requests .  The court cautioned Glass that  his initial proposed outline \nfor jurisdictional discovery  at Dkt. 23-2 was far too broad  and disproportiona te.  The court  \nordered Glass to supplement his motion with a list of narrow ed, targeted  discovery requests, \nand suggested an interrogatory as an example.   \nGlass has now supplemented his motion for jurisdictional discovery  and includes a list \nof proposed requests for  production .  Dkt. 25- 4.  For the reasons below, the court will largely \ndeny Glass’s motion, while  allowing some  limited jurisdictional discovery  to go forward .2 \nLEGAL STANDARD  \n“Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any \nparty’s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance \nof the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the par ties’ relative access to \n \nestablishing new law”).  The pitfalls of submitting court filings that contain hallucinated \ncitations are obvious, and courts have sanctioned license d attorneys and self -represented \nlitigants alike for their failure to exercise diligence.  See, e.g. , Mid Cent. Operating Eng’rs Health \n& Welfare Fund v. HoosierVac LLC , No. 24 -cv-00326- JPH-MJD, 2025 WL 1511211, at *2 (S.D. \nInd. May 28, 2025)  (imposing a monetary sanction on an attorney who “ filed briefs containing \nnon-existent AI -generated legal citations on three separate occasions”); Saxena v. Martinez -\nHernandez , No. 22 -cv-02126- CDS- BNW, 2025 WL 1194003, at *2 n.5 (D. Nev. Apr. 23, \n2025) (collecting cases and warning self -represented  litigants that generative artificial \nintelligence can create “hallucinat[ed]” case citations and using these citations may lead to court -imposed sanctions).   Going forward, a party that provides  authority to the court that \ndoes not actually exist  may be sanctioned . \n2 The court also ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding a protective order that would \naddress Glass’s concern about  making sensitive business information public .  The parties have \nfiled a stipulated protective order, Dkt. 30, that the court accepts and adopts as its order.  Case: 3:24-cv-00769-jdp     Document #: 32     Filed: 11/04/25     Page 2 of 7   \n \n3 \n relevant information, the parties’ resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the \nissues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely \nbenefit.  Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be \ndiscoverable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).    \nDiscovery is not limited to the merits of a case; “where issues arise as to jurisdiction or \nvenue, discovery is available to ascertain the facts bearing on such issues.”  Oppenheimer Fund, \nInc. v. Sanders , 437 U.S. 340, 351 n. 13 (1978).  It is within the discretion of the district court \nto allow a party  to conduct limited discovery to establish that jurisdiction exists.  Cent. States, \nSe. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v. Reimer Express World Corp. , 230 F.3d 934, 947 (7th Cir. 2000).  \nThe critical question is whether the requested discovery “ is relevant and necessary to the \nresolution of the jurisdictional issue before the court. ”  Bouste ad v. Barancik , 151 F.R.D. 102, \n104 (E.D. Wis. 1993).   \nANALYSIS  \nThe d efendant LLP asserts in its motion to dismiss that the court does not have \njurisdiction over this action because there is no diversity of citizenship between the parties.  \nFor purposes of determining jurisdiction, federal courts deem “ a limited partnership to be a \ncitizen of every state in which any of its partners, general or limited, is a citizen .”  Qin v. \nDeslongchamps , 31 F.4th 576, 579 (7th Cir. 2022).  “[T]he citizenship of unincorporated \nassociations must be traced through however many layers of partners or membe rs there may \nbe.”  Meyerson v. Harrah’s E. Chicago Casino , 299 F.3d 616, 617 (7th Cir. 2002).  The complaint \nalleges that Glass is a citizen of Minnesota  while the defendant has no “ LLP presence in the \nState of Minnesota ,” but maintains a place of business in the Western District of Wisconsin.   \nDkt. 1 , ¶¶ 1–2.  On the face of the complaint, complete diversity of citizenship exists.  Case: 3:24-cv-00769-jdp     Document #: 32     Filed: 11/04/25     Page 3 of 7   \n \n4 \n But d efendant argues that , contrary to the allegations in the complaint, one of its \npartners, Attorney Adam Schurle, is a Minnesota citizen who works for defendant out of his \nMinnesota home.  Attorney Schurle attests that he joined  defendant Foley  “as a lateral Tax \npartner in January 2022,” and is assigned to the Milwaukee, Wisconsin office, but works \nremotely full- time from Minnesota.  Dkt. 15, ¶ 2.  He further attests that he is an “Active \nPartner,” and that there are no other classifications of partners at Foley  other than Retired \nPartners .  Dkt. 27, ¶¶ 5– 6.  Defendant has produced Attorney Schurle’s Memorandum of \nUnderstanding , which states that he  is an “Active Partner” as of January 24, 2022, and was \nsigned by all of  the members of defendant’s Management Committee, including its then -CEO.  \nDkt. 27- 1 at 2, 6.   \nDespite these attestations, Glass believes that Attorney Schurle is a partner in name \nonly, who defendant hired in anticipation of this “high -stakes” lawsuit to ensure that it is \nlitigated in state court .  Dkt. 25 at 15.  In support , Glass  notes that when he requested copies \nin 2022 of invoices f or the period defendant represented him, he received a response from \ndefendant’s general counsel rather than a records clerk, suggesting  that defendant was \nconcerned Glass  was gathering documents in preparation for litigation.  Glass theorizes  that \ndefendant then engaged in “jurisdictional manipulation” by hiring Attorney Schurle .  Glass \nsuggests that defendant pays its partners via a Schedule K -1, a tax document used to report the \nincome, losses, and dividends for a business’s partners.   But he maintains that  having Schurle \ncomplete the IRS 7 -question employee “Litmus Test” will prove that Attorney S churle  should \nbe paid via IRS Form W -2 as an  employee rather than an “income partner .”  Id. at 4–7, 14.3  \n \n3 Glass bases this theory on the advice received from Richard Stang, a business tax advisor who \nalso helped Glass draft his proposed jurisdictional discovery requests.  Dkt. 25 at 17.  Case: 3:24-cv-00769-jdp     Document #: 32     Filed: 11/04/25     Page 4 of 7   \n \n5 \n If Attorney Schurle is really an “income partner” or employee, Glass maintains  that his \ncitizenship can be disregarded for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.  Id. at 9. \nEven though defendant has produced the Memorandum of Understanding , Glass \ncontends that the court must take “a substance -over-form approach when determining \nwhether” this attorney “is a genuine member/partner of the LLP” with a real stake in it.  Dkt. \n25 at 10. Specifically, h e proposes to depose five individuals, including Attorney S churle, \ndefendant’s Director of Human Resources, and the hiring manager who hired Schurle.  Glass also proposes that defendant produce documentation of its one -tier partnership structure, its \nLLP agreement and all amendments since 2021, documentation and correspondence related to \nAttorney Schurle’s hiring, its  2021 and 2022 tax returns, a list of all individuals designated \n“partner,” and their age and years of experience on the date they were elected as partners, all \ndocumentation regarding the voting rights of equity and non -equity partners , and the meeting \nminutes of any meetings since January 2022 to present during which attorneys were elected or \nremoved from the LLP.  \nFrom Attorney Schurle, Glass seeks federal and state tax returns from 2022 through \n2024, all documentation regarding his hiring as a partner, a copy of his answers to the IRS 7-\nquestion employee litmus test, documentation that demonstrates his “level of autonomy within \nthe firm,” a copy of the engagement agreement Attorney Schurle would use with a new tax - or \nenergy -related client, copies of Attorney Schurle’s utility bills  for his Minnesota residence for \nthe months of August, September, and October 2024,  and any document s “that describe Mr. \nSchurle’s ability as a ‘Tax Partner’ to provide input on the management decisions of the firm.”  \nDkt. 25-4 at 1 –2.   Case: 3:24-cv-00769-jdp     Document #: 32     Filed: 11/04/25     Page 5 of 7   \n \n6 \n Glass also seeks documents from defendant’s Director of Human Resources, including \na copy of Attorney Schurle’s offer letter, all correspondence and documentation related to \npaying Attorney Schurle via a K -1 rather than a W -2, documentation indicating that Attorney \nSchurle is paid like all of the other partners, a copy of Attorney Schurle’s employment \nagreement and Memorandum of Understanding ,4 a copy of the HR Director’s answers to the \nIRS 7 -question employee litmus test as to Attorney Schurle, copies of Attorney Schurle’s \nperformance reviews , and performance reviews that he has completed for other attorneys.  \nNeedless to say, Glass did not follow my instruction  to narrow his requests in crafting \nthis list of proposed discovery.  As I specifically cautioned during the preliminary pretrial \nconference, Glass’s inquir ies at this stage are straightforward and do not  require the voluminous \ndiscovery he seeks .  For example, Glass  notes that Attorney Schurle “makes no claim that he \nwas elected to be a member of [defendant’s] Limited Liability Partnership ,” “no claim that he \ncontributed capital at the time he joined the firm or that he has any role in the m anagement \nof the firm.”  Dkt. 25 at 2.  These observations can be posed as questions to defendant in the \nform of interrogatories, which should yield all the information Glass needs to respond to \ndefendant’s motion and the court need s to resolve the jurisdictional question .  Defendant, a \nlaw firm, is undoubtedly well aware of its duty to respond truthfully and completely to good -\nfaith discovery requests.    \nAccordingly, the court DENIES Glass’s motion in large part but GRANTS it in this one \nnarrow respect:  The proposed discovery is modified to pose the following t hree special \ninterrogatories  to defendant:  \n \n4 As noted, this document has be en filed with the court at Dkt. 27 -1. Case: 3:24-cv-00769-jdp     Document #: 32     Filed: 11/04/25     Page 6 of 7   \n \n7 \n 1. State whether Adam Schurle  was elected to be a member of defendant’s Limited \nLiability Partnership  and, if so, the dates h e was an active member.  \n2. State whether Adam Schurle contributed capital at the time he joined defendant’s \nLimited Liability Partnership  as a partner  and, if so, the amount.  \n3. State whether Adam Schurle  has any role in the management of the firm  and, if so, \nthe role and duties.  \nDefendant  has until November 18 , 2025 to respond.  Glass may then have until \nDecember 9 , 2025,  to respond to defendant’s motion to dismiss, and any reply will be due by \nDecember 19 , 2025.  \nORDER  \nIT IS ORDERED that:  \n1. Plaintiff Todd Glass’s motion for jurisdictional discovery, Dkt. 23 & Dkt. 25, is \nGRANTED in part and DENIED in part, as set forth above .  Discovery otherwise \nremains stayed pending the court’s resolution of defendant’s motion to dismiss, Dkt. \n13. \n2. The parties’ stipulated motion for a protective order, Dkt. 30, is GRANTED.  \n3. Plaintiff’s response to defendant’s motion to dismiss, Dkt. 13, is due December 9 , \n2025.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiff Mozart Saint Cyr sued JPMorgan Chase, alleging they violated Massachusetts law by subjecting him to a de facto lie detector test using an AI-powered HireVue Interview during his job application process and failing to provide statutory notice regarding lie detector rights. The court dismissed the lie detector claim due to insufficient allegations demonstrating the HireVue Interview's use for truth detection and remanded the notice claim to state court for lack of jurisdiction, as the plaintiff couldn't establish harm from not receiving the notice.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether JPMorgan Chase's use of AI-powered HireVue Interviews constitutes a violation of the Massachusetts Lie Detector Statute, and if the absence of statutory notice about lie detector tests results in a legal claim.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court found the plaintiff's lie detector allegations insufficient and unrelated to the HireVue Interview's purpose of detecting lies, leading to the dismissal of the lie detector claim. The notice claim was remanded to state court due to lack of Article III standing, as the plaintiff couldn’t show a concrete injury.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're applying for a job, and they ask you to do an online interview where a computer program analyzes your answers and expressions. You think this is like a lie detector test, but the court says you haven't shown enough evidence to prove the company used it to see if you were lying. Plus, you didn't lose anything when they didn't tell you about lie detector rules, so that part of your case goes back to state court, which has different rules for hearing cases.",

Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B (the “Lie Detector Statute”).  Plaintiff brings these claims on behalf of himself and \non behalf of all others similarly situated.  JPMorgan has moved to dismiss.  For the reasons stated \nherein, the Court finds Plaintiff’s allegations insufficient as to the purported lie detector test and \nfinds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over his notice claim.  Accordingly, the Court will grant \nJPMorgan’s motion in part, deny the motion in part, and remand the notice claim. \nI. Background \nA. Factual Background \nThe Court draws the following facts from the Amended Complaint, Dkt. 17 (“Compl.”), \nand accepts them as true for purposes of the instant motion. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 1 of 8 \n2 Plaintiff applied to work at JPMorgan in or around September 2023 and again in or around \nDecember 2024.  Id. ¶ 8.  Neither application included the following notice: \nIt is unlawful in Massachusetts to require or administer a lie detector test as a \ncondition of employment or continued employment.  An employer who violates \nthis law shall be subject to criminal penalties and civil liability. \nId. ¶¶ 1–2, 8; see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2)(b) (“All applications for employment \nwithin the commonwealth shall contain the following notice which shall be in clearly legible \nprint.”).  Also, as part of one or both applications, JPMorgan requested that Plaintiff take a HireVue \nInterview, which Plaintiff completed.  Compl.  ¶¶ 3, 8. \nHireVue Interviews are an artificial-intelligence-powered job candidate screening tool, \nprovided by HireVue, Inc (“HireVue”).  Id. ¶ 20.  HireVue Interviews work by having job \ncandidates answer a set of interview questions online while being recorded.  Id.1  Applicants may \nbe asked questions related to honesty or integrity ( e.g., “Tell me about a time that you acted with \nintegrity.”).  Id. ¶ 22.  HireVue analyzes interviews using three types of data: language input, \nspeech input, and video input.  Id. ¶ 23.  “Language input” refers to the content of job candidates’ \nspoken responses, which are transcribed and assessed using artificial intelligence against “relevant \ncompetencies.”  Id. ¶¶ 24–27 (brackets omitted).  “Speech input” and “video input” refer to a \ncandidate’s tone, expression, and other verbal-visual cues, which are analyzed using third-party, \nartificial-intelligence technology and converted into an “employability score” or \n“competency-level scoring report” by HireVue.  Id. ¶¶ 28–32 (brackets and quotation marks \nomitted).  “Such scores can be tailored to meet employers’ highly individualized needs.”  Id. ¶ 33.  \n \n1 Plaintiff states that, “[b]efore posing such questions, Defendant issues instructions to job applicants”—“‘to \nsupply accurate and complete data’”—and “seeks [applicants’] certification”—“‘that all statements in [their] \napplication form[s] are true and correct to the best of [their] knowledge.’”  Compl. ¶ 21 (quoting Dkt. 17-3 at 2, 7 \n(emphasis in Amended Complaint)).  The quoted exhibit is a JPMorgan job application form that does not reference \nHireVue Interviews.  See generally Dkt. 17-3. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 2 of 8 \n3 However, the HireVue algorithm typically evaluates cognitive ability, emotional intelligence, and \npersonality traits, which may include whether the applicant has an “innate sense of integrity and \nhonor.”  Id. ¶¶ 33–34. \nB. Procedural Background \nOn April 28, 2025, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit against JPMorgan in the Suffolk County \nSuperior Court for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Dkt. 14 at 3–10.  On June 16, 2025, \nJPMorgan removed to this Court pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1332(d)(2), asserting minimal diversity and an amount in controversy exceeding $5 million.  \nSee generally Dkt. 1.  On July 17, 2025, upon an earlier motion to dismiss, later denied as moot, \nPlaintiff amended his complaint.  Dkts. 12–13, 17–18. \nIn his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges three claims on behalf of himself and on behalf \nof a putative class or sub-class of job applicants: (1) for declaratory and injunctive relief, Compl. \n¶¶ 44–47; (2) for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2), Compl. ¶¶ 48–  55 (the “Lie \nDetector Claim”); and (3) for violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2)(b), Compl. ¶¶ 56–  59 \n(the “Notice Claim”). \nOn August 25, 2025, JPMorgan filed the instant motion to dismiss under Federal \nRule 12(b)(6).  Dkt. 21; see also Dkt. 22 (“Memo.”).  On September 8, 2025, Plaintiff opposed.  \nDkt. 23 (“Opp.”).  With leave, JPMorgan filed a reply on September 22, 2025.  Dkt. 28 (“Reply”). \nII. Legal Standard \nCourts analyzing claims under Federal Rule 12(b)(6) must determine whether a plaintiff’s \nfactual allegations—disregarding all “conclusory” statements—“state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  “The inquiry is usually limited \nto the facts alleged in the complaint, incorporated into the complaint, or susceptible to judicial \nnotice,” Whelden v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n , 494 F. Supp. 3d 68, 73 (D. Mass. 2020) (citing In re Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 3 of 8 \n4 Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp. , 324 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003)), “but the court may also consider \nother documents the authenticity of which is not disputed by the parties, documents central to the \nplaintiff’s claim, and documents sufficiently referred to in the complaint,” id. (citing Watterson v. \nPage, 987 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993)). \nIII. Discussion \nA. The Lie Detector Claim \n“The Lie Detector Statute prohibits employers in Massachusetts from subjecting \nemployees or applicants to lie detector tests as a condition of employment or continued \nemployment.”  Baker v. CVS Health Corp. , 717 F. Supp. 3d 188, 190 (D. Mass. 2024).2  The statute \ndefines a “lie detector test” as: \n[A]ny test utilizing a polygraph or any other device, mechanism, instrument or \nwritten examination, which is operated, or the results of which are used or \ninterpreted by an examiner for the purpose of purporting to assist in or enable the \ndetection of deception, the verification of truthfulness, or the rendering of a \ndiagnostic opinion regarding the honesty of an individual. \nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(1).  Thus, the statute creates two classes of lie detector tests: a \npolygraph constitutes a lie detector test ipso facto ; alternatively, “any other device, mechanism, \n \n2 In Baker, the defendants “[did] not challenge the sufficiency of the claims that [the defendants had] violated \nthe Lie Detector Statute” by subjecting their applicants to HireVue Interviews.  717 F. Supp. 3d at 189–90.  \nAccordingly, the Court did not have occasion to consider whether the HireVue Interviews, as used by those defendants, \nconstituted lie detector tests under section 19B. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 4 of 8 \n5 instrument or written examination” can qualify as a de facto lie detector test if it used “for the \npurpose of” lie detection.  Id.3 \nPlaintiff alleges that JPMorgan subjected him to a ( de facto) lie detector test by requiring \nhim to take a HireVue Interview as part of his job application.  Compl. ¶¶ 48–55.  However, the \nAmended Complaint contains insufficient allegations to support the inference that his interview \nwas used for the purpose of truth assessment.  Plaintiff’s allegations do no more than establish that \nHireVue Interviews could constitute lie detector tests when used for that purpose.  However, this \nis not enough.  Any “device, mechanism, instrument or written examination” could qualify as a lie \ndetector test if used for that purpose.  To wit, if an employer were to give his applicant an IQ test \non the belief that people with certain IQs are inherently deceitful, wanting to find that out, that \nwould likely violate the Lie Detector Statute, notwithstanding the apparent silliness of that usage.  \nThus, that HireVue holds its product out as having any capability with respect to truth detection \n \n3 See also Auguste v. G4S Secure Sols. (USA), Inc. , No. SUCV14-3311-BLS1 (Mass. Sup. Ct. Apr. 25, 2016) \n(slip op.) (attached to JPMorgan’s Memo. at Dkt. 22-1).  Auguste considered, at summary judgment, an employer’s \nuse of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (the “MMPI-2”).  Id. at *1.  As explained in the opinion, \nthe MMPI-2 can indicate certain mental illnesses, including some that are correlated with dishonesty.  Id. at *3–4, \n9–10.  The MMPI-2 further relies on “validity scales,” including the “L” (“Lie”) scale, which can indicate a \n“non-credible pattern of responses” resulting from “intentional deception” or from other causes, such as a “high need \nto see oneself as extremely virtuous.”  Id. at *4–5, 10.  The Auguste court found that the MMPI-2’s diagnostic function \ndid not render it a lie detector test under section 19B because it merely indicated mental illness correlated with \ndishonesty, rather than dishonesty itself.  Id. at *9–10.  The court likewise found that the MMPI-2’s “L” scale did not \nturn the MMPI-2 into a lie detector test because that scale measured incredibility beyond just “intentional deception” \nand because the scale’s “purpose” was “to validate the test results,” rather than to “detect[] . . . lies.”  Id. at *10–12 \n(emphasis in original).  Further, the Court highlighted the statute’s “requirement that the test be employed for the \n‘purpose’ of determining deception or rendering an opinion regarding honesty,” noting that it “need not resolve the \nabstract question of whether the MMPI-2 could detect deception so as to possibly constitute a ‘lie detector test’ in \ncertain circumstances” but rather only whether the defendant’s “use of the MMPI-2 rendered it a lie detector test.”  Id. \nat *12 (emphasis in original).  The Court then turned to evidence that the defendant had used plaintiff’s MMPI-2 \nscores to determine his “psychological suitability” for the job, rather than to detect deception.  Id. at *12–13.  Thus, \nthe court concluded that the defendant did not violate section 19B by administering the test.  Id. at *14. \nPlaintiff points out that Auguste was decided at summary judgment and argues that his case, too, “merit[s] \nconsiderable discovery.”  Opp. at 4 n.1.  However, the availability of summary judgment to test the sufficiency of \nevidence does not obviate a plaintiff’s duty to plead his claims sufficiently in the first instance. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 5 of 8 \n6 matters only insofar as it makes plausible that JPMorgan used the HireVue Interview for that \npurpose. \nPlaintiff’s allegations demonstrate the multi-utility of a HireVue Interview, making \nJPMorgan’s mere alleged use inadequate to demonstrate its purpose.  HireVue generates scores \nfrom its interviews based on “precise criteria [that] are often developed in consultation with the \nemployer,” “tailored to meet employers’ highly individualized needs.”  Id. ¶ 33.  Thus, a HireVue \nInterview might plausibly be employed for a wide variety of lawful (or unlawful) purposes, and \nnothing in the allegations suggests that lie detection is chief among its use cases, such to make any \ngiven user’s purpose readily apparent.  See, e.g., id. ¶ 35 (quoting a HireVue patent that includes \n“reliability, honesty, and integrity” on a non-exhaustive list of 23 “potential competencies” that \nthe platform can analyze (emphasis removed)).  JPMorgan’s use of HireVue Interviews is therefore \n“merely ‘consistent with’ unlawful action and is ‘just as much in line with’ lawful action.”  See \nFrith v. Whole Foods Mkt., Inc. , 38 F.4th 263, 270 (1st Cir. 2022) (quoting Ocasio-Hernandez v. \nFortuno-Burset , 640 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2011)).  Plaintiff offers no other allegations that would \npermit the inference that JPMorgan has used or uses HireVue Interviews, either generally or as to \nPlaintiff’s application, for the unlawful purpose.4 \nAccordingly, the Court finds Plaintiff’s lie detector allegations “wholly conclusory” and \nso will dismiss the Lie Detector Claim.5  See id. \n \n4 Plaintiff does not argue, and the Court does not find, that JPMorgan’s requiring applicants to certify the \ntruthfulness of their applications converts the HireVue Interview into a lie detector test or else meaningfully suggests \nthat JPMorgan’s use of HireVue Interviews is for that improper purpose.  See Opp. at 7–10; Compl. ¶ 21; note 1, infra.  \nReading the Lie Detector Statute to prohibit employers from asking applicants not to lie on their applications would \nproduce “absurd results.”  See Commonwealth v. Morgan , 476 Mass. 768, 778 (2017) (advising courts to interpret \nstatutes “in a commonsense way”).  \n5 Likewise, the Court will dismiss that part of Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief based on \nthe Lie Detector Claim allegations.  See Compl. ¶¶ 44–47. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 6 of 8 \n7 B. The Notice Claim \nAs to Plaintiff’s Notice Claim, the parties focus almost exclusively on issues of statutory \ninterpretation—namely, whether the Lie Detector Statute creates a private cause of action for \nenforcement of its notice requirement and whether, if so, Plaintiff qualifies as a “person aggrieved” \nunder that statute for purposes of bringing such a claim.6  See Memo. at 15–25; Opp. at 10–26; \nReply at 9–16. \nBut before reaching these merits issues, the Court “must satisfy itself as to its jurisdiction, \nincluding [Plaintiff’s] Article III standing to sue . . . regardless of whether the litigants have raised \nthe issue of standing.”  See Pagan v. Calderon , 448 F.3d 16, 26 (1st Cir. 2006).  “The standing \ninquiry is . . . claim-specific,” meaning that the Court must determine whether Plaintiff “is entitled \nto have a federal court adjudicate each particular claim that he asserts.”  See id. \nWithout a viable allegation of having been subjected to a lie detector test, Plaintiff lacks \nArticle III standing for his Notice Claim, and so the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider it.  \nPlaintiff’s only purported injury is that he was not apprised of his rights under section 19B.  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 8, 18.7  Since this purely informational injury resulted in no “downstream \nconsequences”— i.e., Plaintiff did not, as a result, take a lie detector test contrary to his rights—it \n \n6 Compare Auguste v. G4S Secure Sols. (USA), Inc. , No. SUCV14-3311-BLS1, at *13–15 (Mass. Sup. Ct. \nApr. 25, 2016) (slip op.) (attached to JPMorgan’s Memo. at Dkt. 22-1) (concluding that there was no private cause of \naction to enforce the notice requirement and that the plaintiff, who had not shown that he was subject to a lie detector \ntest, was not a “person aggrieved” under the statute), with Baker , 717 F. Supp. 3d at 192–93 (concluding that there \nwas a private cause of action to enforce the notice requirement). \n7 Plaintiff also states that, “[h]ad [he] been made aware by Defendant that the HireVue Interview was a lie \ndetector test, he would not have completed the HireVue Interview.”  Compl. ¶ 8.  But the statutory notice does not \ninclude the definition of a lie detector test.  See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(2)(b).  As such, it is not obvious why \nnotice would have helped Plaintiff evaluate whether the HireVue Interview was being used as a lie detector test. Case 1:25-cv-11751-BEM     Document 29     Filed 10/22/25     Page 7 of 8 \n8 cannot provide a basis for standing.8  See TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , 594 U.S. 413, 442 (2021) \n(“An ‘asserted informational injury that causes no adverse effects cannot satisfy \nArticle III.’” (quoting Trichell v. Midland Credit Mgmt., Inc. , 964 F.3d 990, 1004 (11th Cir. \n2020))). \nBecause the Court finds a lack of Article III standing, a jurisdictional defect, “the proper \ncourse is remand.”  Maine Ass’n of Interdependent Neighborhoods v. Comm’r, Me. Dep’t of Hum. \nServs., 876 F.2d 1051, 1054 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting Langford v. Gates , 610 F. Supp. 120, 122–23 \n(C.D. Cal. 1985)).9  Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c), the Court will remand the \nNotice Claim.10 \nIV. Conclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons, JPMorgan’s motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and \nDENIED in part.  This action is hereby remanded to the Suffolk County Superior Court. \nSo Ordered.  \n \n /s/ Brian E. Murphy    \n Brian E. Murphy \nDated:  October 22, 2025 Judge, United States District Court \n \n8 In Baker, the court concluded that the plaintiff had stated a “concrete informational injury” because, “as a \ndownstream consequence of not receiving notice, he participated in a HireVue Interview.”  717 F. Supp. at 192.  \nHowever, in Baker, the defendants did not challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s lie detector allegations.  Id. at \n190.  Thus, the court could take for granted that the HireVue Interview was a lie detector test and thus that its \nimposition was an injury “of the kind the statute was designed to protect.”  Id. at 192.  By contrast, in this case, \nJPMorgan has successfully shown that inference to be unreasonable.  Thus, Plaintiff’s position is akin to the \nhypothetical case, distinguished by the Baker court, of an “[a]pplicant[] who never took” any lie detector test, whom \nthe Baker court recognized “may well be in a different boat on the standing question.”  Id. at 192 n.2. \n9 As Plaintiff points out, Massachusetts courts, like state courts in general, are not subject to Article III \nlimitations.  See, e.g., Kenn v. Eascare, LLC , 103 Mass. App. Ct. 643, 649 (2024) (holding that an injury deemed \ninsufficiently concrete under Article III was nonetheless adequate for the claim to proceed in state court under \nMassachusetts standing principles). \n10 Likewise, the Court will remand that part of Plaintiff’s claim for declaratory and injunctive relief based on \nthe Notice Claim allegations.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of Shared Partnership v. Meta Platforms, Inc., the United States District Court for the Northern District of California addressed discovery disputes related to the production of documents. The Plaintiff requested that Meta be compelled to complete document production by a certain date, especially concerning Meta's use of artificial intelligence (AI) to reject advertisements, including those related to the Plaintiff. The court denied the Plaintiff's request, finding it unjustified and premature, emphasizing that broad discovery into AI use was not proportionately relevant to the Plaintiff's claims in the current procedural context.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue revolved around whether Meta Platforms, Inc., should be compelled to complete its document production by a specific deadline, particularly concerning documents related to its use of AI in ad rejection.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court denied the Plaintiff's request to force Meta to complete its document production by the specified deadline. Furthermore, it rejected the Plaintiff's attempt to establish broad discovery into Meta's use of AI to reject advertisements not related to the Plaintiff, due to lack of relevance and proportionality.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're arguing with someone to show you all their private documents right away, especially about how they use a robot helper to decide things. The judge said, “Not so fast!” They noted that it's not fair to ask for everything because it's not all related to what you're trying to prove, and it's way too much to ask for all at once. So, the judge said, “Let's do this step-by-step and only look at what really matters to the case.”",

Nos. 47, 49  \n \n \n Now pending before the court are a pair of discovery dispute letter briefs (dkts. 47, 49) \nthat, generally speaking, represent Plaintiff’s request  to compel the production of certain \ndiscovery. It app ears that the two letters are substantially the same, wit h the exception that the first \nletter appears to have been rushed to court  before Defendant could articulate its position as to one \nof the issues raised by Plaintiff ( see dkt. 47 at 3 -4; see also  dkt. 49 at 1, 4 -5). Defendant submits \nthat Plaintiff has involved the  court prematurely, that the dispute is not quite ripe for a motion to \ncompel, and that the parties should continue to engage one another in the discovery process. See \nLtr. Br. (dkt. 49) at 2. For the reasons stated below, the court wholeheartedly agrees.  \n Plaintiff has presented two issues . In the first, Plaintiff complains of the timing of \nDefendant’s document production. See id . at 1 -2. In this regard, Plaintiff subm its that it tendered  a \nset of interrogatories and requests for production in late October of 2022, and that Defendant’s \nresponses – which were served in mid -December of 2022, did not contain substantive information \nbut were rather limited to objections (pr esumably as to some requests) and statements to the effect \nthat responsive documents and information would be produced on a rolling basis (again, \npresumably as to certain other  requests). Id. at 1. Based only on the argument that Plaintiff should Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  not be fo rced to agree to an  speculative  extension of the fact discovery deadline ( currently set for \nSeptember 21, 2023) and risk pushing back an already -scheduled  trial date of April 2024, Plaintiff \nsubmits that Defendant should now be forced “to complete its enti re document production by \nApril 7, 2023” because it “has had more than enough time – and has more than enough resources – \nto accomplish this.” Id. at 2.   \n Defendant respond s to the effect that Plaintiff’s 41  document requests  are relatively broad \nand that they seek , among other things , all documents relating to Plaintiff , all documents regarding \nPlaintiff ’s rejected advertisements  on Defendant’s platform , and all documents concerning \nDefendant ’s use of artificial intelligence to reject any and all advertisements  in general (that is, not \nsimply information limited to the rejection of Plaintiff’s own advertisements – the subject of this \naction) . Id. at 2. Nevertheless, Defendant submits that through its December responses, it agr eed to \nsearch for and  produce several categories of information  including documents relating to \nPlaintiff ’s rejected advertisements, notifications regarding those advertisements, and \ncommunications between the Parties . Id.  Following discussions  regarding the scope, relevance, \nand proportionality of the  requested  discovery, Defendant states that it  has agreed to produce a \nnarrowed set of documents for the majority of Plaintiff’s requests , and that it is working  diligently \nto gather responsive, non -privileged documents  for production. Id. at 2 -3.  \nHowever, Defendant contends that there are three  remining hurdles. As to the first, \nDefendant states that it “cannot produce any documents until a stipulated protective order is \nentered between the parties and Court, and the parties are currently negotiating the substance of \nthe protective order so that [Defendant]  can begin producing documents.” Id. at 3. The court finds \nthat this hurdle is easy to surmount. The Parties are herewith ORDERED  to promptly meet and \nconfer in a good faith effort to iron out their differences as to their respective views regarding  the \nsubstance of the protective order necessary such that Defendant can begin producing documents . \nThe court recommends, but does not require, using this district’s model protective order at least as \na starting point . In the event that the Parties cannot arrive at a stipulated resolution, the Parties are \nFURTHER ORDERED  to clearly and concisely present what dispute s remain in this regard \nthrough a jointly -filed letter brief conforming to the requirements set forth in ¶ 4 of the Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  undersigned’s general standi ng order.1 \nAs to the second hurdle, Defendant submits that it  “continues to work diligently to search \nfor documents responsive to the majority of [the]  requests it has agreed to produce ” and that it \n“has already identified tens of thousands of potentially  responsive documents to [Plaintiff’s]  \nrejected advertisements and notifications regarding those rejected advertisements. ” Id. at 3. \nDefendant explains that the responsive discovery is voluminous and time -consuming to gather and \nproduce due to the fact tha t Plaintiff’s advertising relationship on Defendant’s platform “ goes back \nover ten years, and the volume of data is substantial ,” as well as the fact that “ the process to search \nfor, review, and pull those documents, which began months ago, is manual  — [and] there are thus \nmultiple, time -consuming steps [Defendant]  must undertake before it can produce information \nregarding [Plaintiff’s]  disapproved advertisements, of which there were many. ” Id. Defendant then \nadds that this is why it has focused on only pot entially responsive documents – that is, those \nrelated to Plaintiff’s rejected advertisements – rather than documents related to Defendant’s more \n“general purported use of artificial intelligence. ” Id. At bottom, Defendant contends that “[t] hese \ndocuments are probative of whether [Plaintiff’s]  ads were rejected and what notice [Plaintiff]  \nreceived regarding those ads, which is directly relevant to [the]  fraud -based claims. ” Id. The court \nfinds that the assertion of this hurdle is closely intertwined with the second issue raised by \nPlaintiff’s request to compel; accordingly, the court will address it below.  \nAs to the third hurdle, Defendant submits that it  has not yet provided a  specific  date by \nwhich  it will complete production of all resp onsive, non -privileged documents because it \n“continues to search for responsive documents, the extent of those documents, and  [because it is \ncurrently engaged in]  the labor -intensive process of pulling those potentially responsive \ndocuments. ” Id. In short,  Defendant submits that it “ has been working for months to gather and \nreview documents for production once the protective order is entered ,” and that it  “intends on \nproducing documents on a rolling basis shortly thereafter. ” Id.  \nIn essence, this dispute b oils down to Plaintiff’s desire to rush Defendant through the \n \n1 See https://www.cand.uscourts.gov/wp -content/uploads/judges/illman -rmi/RMI -Standing -Order -\nRevised9 -16-22.pdf  Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  discovery process based only on a thin justification that Defendant “has had more than enough \ntime – and has more than enough resources – to accomplish this.” Id. at 2. The court finds this \nnotion to be unpersuasive. The alleged magnitude of Defendant’s resources, and the passage of a \nfew months of time does not justify arbitrarily setting a production deadline of April 7, 2023, as \nPlaintiff suggests. Once the Parties’ dispute about the terms of the forthcoming protective order \n(either by stipulation or by court order) are resolved, the court sees no  reason – and Plaintiff has \ncertainly  not suggested one – that Defendant’s production should not proceed on the rolling basis \nit has suggested and jus tified. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s request to force Defendant to complete its \nproduction by April 7, 2023, is DENIED . \nAs to the second issue, Plaintiff seeks an order “ making clear that [Defendant’s]  use of \nartificial intelligence to reject ads —including wha t it did and did not know about the ability of \nartificial intelligence to provide explanations for ad rejections —is both relevant and discoverable. ” \nId. Plaintiff then adds that “[t] his dispute is implicated by the following discovery requests: a) \nInterrog atories 2 -4 and b) RFP Nos. 15 -20; 25 -34; and 38 -41.” Id. at 4. Plaintiff has not include d \nthose discovery requests as attachments or exhibits to its letter brief. However, this omission is \nunimportant for two reasons.  \nFirst, Plaintiff has failed to convi nce the undersigned as to the probative value of this \noverwhelmingly broad request. Plaintiff points to the fact that its fraud claim survived dismissal \nwhen the presiding judge found that because Plaintiff had asserted that Defendant’s advertising \npolicie s contained a fraudulent statement to the effect that advertising  partners would be provided \nwith sufficient details to bring their rejected ads into conformity with Defendant’s  policies , it was \ntherefore plausible that a reasonable consumer would concur with Plaintiff ’s interpretation of the \npolicies, notwithstanding Defendant’s contrary interpretation.  Id. In short, in the context of \ndeciding a motion to dismiss, the presiding judge found that it was plau sible  that Defendant knew \nor should have known that it could not comply with this expectation due to its averred reliance on \nartificial intelligence.  Id. However, simply because an allegation has been found  to be sufficiently \nplausible such that  its associ ated claim  survives dismissal , it does not necessarily follow that \ndiscovery thereunder will automatically be found to be  relevant to that claim  at the discovery Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  phase of a case . See e.g.,  Elgindy v. AGA Serv. Co. , No. 20 -cv-06304 -JST (RMI), 2021 U.S. Dist . \nLEXIS 211772, at *12 -13 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2021) ( “. . . the scope of Plaintiffs ’ 4 RFPs are more \ngeared to proving or disproving Plaintiffs ’ [own] speculative and editorial musings rather than \nthe[] actual claims. [R]elevance must be tethered to a claim , not simply to an allegation as seems \nto be implied by Plaintiffs ’ suggestion . . . ”). In this regard, the court finds – based on Plaintiff’s \npresentation (limited to the plausibility finding at the motion to dismiss stage) – that generalized \ninformation about Defendant’s suggested use of artificial intelligence to reject advertisements \nother than  Plaintiff’s  own advertisements  would have very little – if any – probative value to \nPlaintiff’s claims.  \nSecond, assuming arguendo  that the relevance of this requ est had been established, \nPlaintiff has expended no effort in justifying the proportionality of such a broad request , while \nDefendant has made a convincing case about its disproportionality . See id . at 3 -4, 5-6. It should be \nnoted  here that in order to suc ceed on a motion to compel, a moving party bears the burden of not \nonly demonstrating relevance, but also  demonstrating  that it has satisfied proportionality and other \nrequirements of Rule 26. See e.g.,  Rodriguez v. Barrita, Inc. , No. 09 -04057 RS  (PSG), 2011 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 134079, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 21, 2011). In light of this, courts are required to limit \ndiscovery if its burden or expense outweighs its likely benefit; this is “the essence of \nproportionality, ” a frequently ignored or overlooked dis covery principle. See e.g. , Hegarty v. \nTransamerica Life Ins. Co. , No. 19 -cv-06006 -MMC (RMI), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 203386, at *5 \n(N.D. Cal. Oct. 21, 2021) ; see also Williams v. Condensed Curriculum Int ’l, No. 20 -cv-05292 -\nYGR (RMI), 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2 11782, at *8 -9 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 2, 2021) ; see also  Mediatek, \nInc. v. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. , No. 11 -5341 YGR (JSC), 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 122911, \nat *18 -19 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 28, 2013) ( “[U]nder Rule 26 ’s proportionality analysis, the Court must \nweigh t he burden versus the benefit of the discovery sought . . . [and] strike a balance between \nensuring that parties have access to relevant information regarding their claims and defenses, and \nthe burden on the producing party of providing the discovery sought .”). \nAs stated by Defendant, despite the fact that Plaintiff’s artificial intelligence theory was \nfound plausible at the motion to dismiss stage, by no means does it logically follow (as Plaintiff’s Case 3:22-cv-02366-RS     Document 50     Filed 03/14/23     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  arguments imply) that broad -based and wholesale discovery  into all aspects of Defendant’s \npurported use of artificial intelligence to reject the advertisements of all of its many customers \nwould be proportional to the needs of Plaintiff’s case which involves a drastically smaller subset \nof events. Accordingly, P laintiff’s request for a finding as to the general discoverability of \nDefendant’s use of artificial intelligence to reject advertisements other than its own is DENIED .  \nIn closing, t he court also feels compelled to admonish the Parties to work together mor e \nefficiently  going forward  to resolve their discovery disputes with minimal need for court \nintervention.  “[T]this court is not a clearinghouse for resolving insignificant, unripe, or moot \ndiscovery disputes. Instead, counsel should be mindful that discove ry is the responsibility of the \nparties and turning to the court to resolve a discovery dispute should only be used as a last resort. ” \nMiranda Dairy v. Harry Shelton Livestock , LLC, No. 18 -cv-06357 -RMI, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n197775, at *13 (N.D. Cal.

Attorneys practicing in this court are \nexpected to seek court involvement in discovery disputes only  as a last resort, and only when the \ndispute implicates truly significant interests that counsel cannot resolve through reasonable \ncooperation during the meet -and-confer process.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut dismissed Christopher B. Reilly's lawsuit against the Connecticut Interlocal Risk Management Agency and others under 28 U.S.C. § 1915, finding that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The court also identified issues with Reilly's filings possibly due to reliance on artificial intelligence (AI), suggesting that AI might have generated inaccurate or fictitious legal citations that did not support his claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's complaint stated a valid claim for relief that could proceed under the screening process required by 28 U.S.C. § 1915 for in forma pauperis complaints.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Reilly's complaint did not state any viable legal claims, including procedural due process, civil conspiracy, retaliation, and mail fraud claims. Consequently, the court dismissed the action as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) due to the failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you can file a lawsuit without paying upfront, but the court first checks if your complaint is likely strong enough. This court looked at a person's complaint against a city and some employees but decided it wasn't strong enough because it didn't clearly show any legal wrongdoing that could result in a win. The court also thought the person might have used a computer program to write parts of it that made up or messed up important details about previous court cases. So, the judge said, \"We can't move forward with this,\" and dismissed the case.",

OLIVER, United States  District  Judge:  \nPlaintiff Christopher  B. Reilly filed this  suit against the Connecticut Interlocal Risk \nManagement Agency (“CIRMA”), the Town of Enfield, and several individual town \nemployees.1 He has also moved for leave to proceed in forma pauperis.2 Upon initial review, \nhowever, the Court concluded that Reilly’s complaint likely  failed to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted.3 The Court  issue d an Order to Show Cause  to express its concerns and \nexplain its  intent to dismiss the action as 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) requires u nless Reilly adduce d \nfurther facts or law sufficient to demonstrate that his claims are viable .4 Reilly has filed a \nnumber of responses to that Order.5  \n \n1 Compl., ECF No. 1 at 1. \n2 Mot. for Leave to Proceed In Forma Pauperis , ECF No. 2.  \n3 Ord. to Show Cause, ECF No. 9.  \n4 Id. \n5 ECF Nos. 10 -16.

Delphin-\nRittman , No. 3:16- CV-1238 (JAM), 2017 WL 396137, at *2 (D. Conn. Jan. 27, 2017)  (citing \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) ). Section 1915 of Title 28 imposes an affirmative obligation on \ndistrict courts to review in forma pauperis complaints  before service of process.     \nReilly’s brief complaint describes a dispute with the Enfield Police Department \nregarding the handling of a complaint against him.6 In the Court’s Order to Show Cause, the \nCourt explained that it was concerned that none of the four claims Reilly sought to bring —a \nprocedural due process claim, a civil conspiracy claim, a retaliation claim, and a mail fraud \nclaim —appeared to be claims upon which relief could be granted.7 The Court noted that the \nprocedural due process claim likely failed because Reilly did not identify any sort of property \nright at issue in the government’s actions; that his claim of civil conspiracy likely failed as a \nmatter of Connecticut law because he did not allege an additional substantive tort; that his \nclaim for a violation of his First Amendment rights did not allege, in a non- conclusory manner, \nthat he faced  retaliation; and fourth, that his allegation of mail fraud likely failed because \nfederal criminal statutes do not, in the ordinary course, afford private rights of action.8 \nThe Court noted its intent to dismiss this action unless its concerns were rectified and  \nprovided Reilly the opportunity to file a response to the Court’s order.9 Reilly  has filed  \nnumerous responses, but unfortunately these responses do not substantively address the \n \n6 Compl., ECF No. 1; ECF No. 1- 8 at 2.  \n7 Ord. to Show Cause at 3. \n8 Id. at 3 -5.  \n9 Id. at 5 -6. Case 3:25-cv-00640-VDO     Document 18     Filed 06/20/25     Page 2 of 53 Court’s analysis. Instead, the responses predominately raise a variety of arguments about the \nprocess of screening in forma pauperis complaints that 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)  requires.  \nIn the filing most directly responsive to the Court’s Order to Show Cause, Reilly argues \nthat the Order to Show Cause creates the “appearance of advocacy [by the Court] on behalf of \nDefendants.”10 The Court understands that the screening regime of 28 U.S.C. § 1915 may \nappear somewhat unusual in that it requires judicial evaluation prior to a motion from a \ndefendant, but that process is required by federal law.  \nReilly next argues that the process of screening in forma pauperis complaints is a \nviolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.11 This fails because \nprescreening of a complaint does not deprive a litigant of “ life, liberty, or property.” U.S. \nConst. Amend. XIV. Reilly’s last argument is that the Court has a “duty to prioritize \nsubstantive constitutional claims.”12 Assuming, arguendo, that this statement is accurate, the \nstatement would have no bearing on this case. “Prioritizing” the adjudication of one sort of \nclaims provides no basis to allow a party to assert a facially defective claim. Instead, the Court \nis obligated to follow the contours of federal law, no matter the seriousness of the alleged harm.  \nReilly has not responded directly to the concerns that the Court has raised regarding the \nfour claims he seeks to bring. Instead, his various filings repeatedly request that the Court issue \nan order beginning the service of process. These requests misunderstand the nature of \nscreening of in forma pauperis complaints. Such complaints “must be screened, under 28 \n \n10 ECF No. 12 at 3.  \n11 Id. at 4.  \n12 Id. at 5.

And because the Court concludes that Reilly has failed to state a claim on which \nrelief can be granted, this action must be dismissed at this stage . \nFor the reasons set forth in this Order and in the Order to Show Cause, the Court \nconcludes that Reilly’s complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  \nTherefore, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) (ii), the Court must DISMISS the action \nand respectfully requests the Clerk of the Court to close the case. Reilly’s pending motions \n(ECF Nos. 2, 15) are DENIED as moot. \nThe Court must additionally raise one issue sua sponte . In reviewing Reilly’s many \nfilings, the Court noticed several instances in which a case did not  remotely  match the \nproposition for which it was cited. Further, Reilly only once quotes a case: “‘[c]onstitutional \nrights would be of little value if they could be indirectly denied.’ Gideon v. Wainwright , 372 \nU.S. 335, 343 (1963).”  ECF No. 12 at 5. That quote does not appear in Gideon, on the cited \npage or any other.13  \nArtificial intelligence is “known to result in  . . . fictional or hallucinatory citations[.]” \nStrong v. Rushmore Loan Mgmt. Servs., LLC , No. 24 -CV-352, 2025 WL 100904, at *6 (D. \nNeb. Jan. 15, 2025) (quotations omitted); see also Mata v. Avianca, Inc., 678 F. Supp. 3d 443 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2023). For that reason, the Court believes that Reilly  may have used artificial \n \n13 The Supreme Court has stated something nearly identical in an unrelated case. See  Smith v. \nAllwright, 321 U.S. 649, 664 (1944) . Case 3:25-cv-00640-VDO     Document 18     Filed 06/20/25     Page 4 of 55 intelligence in drafting his submissions. Cf. Moales v. Land Rover Cherry Hill , No. 3:25- CV-\n544 (VDO), 2025 WL 1249616 (D. Conn. Apr. 30, 2025) . \nArtificial intelligence may ultimately prove a helpful tool to assist pro se litigants in \nbringing meritorious cases to the courts. In that way, artificial intelligence has the potential to \ncontribute to the cause of justice. However, accessing any benefic ial use of artificial \nintelligence requires carefully understanding its limitations. For example, if merely asked to \nwrite an opposition to an opposing part y’s motion or brief, or to respond to a court order, an \nartificial intelligence program is likely to  generate such a response, regardless of whether the \nresponse actually has an arguable basis in the law. Where the court or opposing party was correct on the law, the program will very likely generate a response or brief that includes a \nfalse statement of the law. And because artificial intelligence synthesizes many sources with \nvarying degrees of trustworthiness, reliance on artificial intelligence without independent \nverification renders litigants unable to represent to the Court that the information in t heir filings \nis truthful.  \n Whether the issues with Reilly’s  filings are the result of artificial intelligence or some \nother mistake, the Court cautions Reilly  to ensure that future submissions to any court  contain \nonly accurate representations.  \n \nSO ORDERED.  \n \nHartford , Connecticut  \nJune 20 , 2025 \n \n/s/Vernon D.

COMPLAINT  \n Plaintiff’s complaint, which utilized the Court’s form complaint for civil rights actions, \nlists the “criminal investigations department” and “Watertown Police department” as defendants. \nDkt. No. 1 at 2 .1  Plaintiff’s claims are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of \n“Civil Rights, Human Rights, Constitutional Rights[.]”  Id . at 3.  Plaintiff  conte nds “[a]s a victim \nof remote neural monitoring, my rights are being violated.”  Id . at 4. \n In support of her  claims, Plaintiff sets forth the following facts, which have occurred on \nan ongoing basis in Watertown: \nThe first time I remember my mind being sent a photograph or video \nimage was in 2018.  Then in 2020 during a neurology scan They sent some sort of imag ing into my brain.  They do this often.  The \nscan was done in March of 2020.  They have been Periodically Seizing my brain using the technology outlined in the Assembly Bill A 8195.  They have brainwashed me.  They work on individual Parts of by brain working on a “program.”  They refer to it as the “System.”  It may have caused severe damage to my body and brain as I am not the same.  \n \nId.  Plaintiff further a vers, as a result of the alleged events,  \nI have sustained severe injuries in the past.  Their techn ology Had \nalmost crippled me.  They are trying to make it seem as if I have multiple personality disorder.  The A.I. has programmed different things in my mind that are absolutely awful.  They have made changes in my emotions, my physiology, my body.  They have tried \nto hypnotize me.  They have done this thing where they seem to broadcast my “voice print” to devices and people.  They have sexually abused me so badly, they have physically abused me, mentally.  They seem to have taken things from my home.  They have a program that can change my handwriting slightly.  They have harassed me, every morning my brain seems to be different as they filled the parts with lies and terrible images.  They treaten to dump \n \n1 Citations to Plaintiff’s submissions will refer to the pagination generated by CM/ECF, the \nCourt’s electronic filing system.

With respect to relief, Plaintiff states:  \nI am seeking money damages.  In the amount of 150,000.00 for the extreme brutal force, almost lethal force, extreme sexual abuse, cruel and unusual punishment, physical abuse, mental abuse and suffering the extreme interrogation techniques the confusion, loss of use of my brain, the invasive Brain wave patterns, the sent videofeeds, texts and disgusting false accusations they constantly have done the way they have ruined my life, sending me a \npsycotropic medication in a brutal way against my will, all the breakins and items they have taken from my home in the past in hopes to frame me as what seems to be some kind of terrible criminal, emotional damages as well I also want the court to help me get off their “system.”  \n \nId.  The complaint is dated March 15, 2024.  Id . at 6. \n Plaintiff subsequently filed an addendum to the complaint on April 11, 2024.  See Dkt. \nNo. 4.\n2  She seeks to  “include federal officials as well.  I believe there may be federal agents who \nare involved with violating my rights.”  Id . at 1.  Plaintiff adds officials violated her  rights under \n“The NYS Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights.  These include A8129, S8209, A8195, A8110 \nlaws Affected by these Bills are Add Art IV §§ 401-409, St Tech L, Amd St Tech L, generally; and § 2.10, CPL Add § 60.80, CPL; add § 4551, CPLR.”  Id .  Plaintiff  further alleges:  \nSince filing the lawsuit they have extensively brainwashed me.   \nThey have caused damage to my brain, cognitive function, nervous \nsystem and have started to give me “disabilities.”  Creating pain in \nmy body.  They use A.I. to manipulate me in every way.  Claiming \nthey are trying to “frame” me.  They have been putting things in my \nmind that never existed before, they have implemented “programs” that hypnotize me they isolate the left top of my brain and fill it with very odd phrases.  They entirely prevented my brain from \nresponding normally.  A corrections officer b y the name of Janelle \nT. told me about this.  She knew this was happening to me.  A police \nOfficer by the name of Officer Macintyre also knows about this as \n \n2 Piecemeal complaints are not permitted.  Because of Plaintiff ’s pro se  status, the Court will \nreview the complaint and “addendum” together for sufficiency pursuant to 28 USC Section 1915.

So I would \nlike to add to the monetary amount I am seeking for damages. I \nwould like to add 850,000 to the damages totaling an amount of 1,000,000.  The amount of pain and suffering I have gone through \nhas been awful and I feel like human life is priceless. \n \nId. at 1 -2. \n Plaintiff also submitted a civil cover sheet.  See Dkt. No. 6.  Plaintiff  did not list any \ndefendants, but listed “Jefferson” as the defendant’s county of residence.  Id. at 1.  Plaintiff \ndescribed the cause of action as “violation of due process of law, violation of state and federal \nA.I. Bill of Rights, Excessive force, Illegal Search and Seizures”  pursuant to the following \nauthorities: “federal A.I. Bill of Rights, Executive order 13960, NYS Bill 1042A, A8195, A8129, A8110.”  Id . \nIV. STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nSection 1915 of Title 28 requires a district court to dismiss an IFP  complaint if the action \nis frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or seeks \nmonetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief.  See  28 U.S.C. § \n1915(e)(2)(B)(i) -(iii); Livingston v. Adirondack Beverage Co., 141 F.3d 434, 437 (2d Cir. 1998).  \nThe Court must also dismiss a complaint, or portion thereof, when the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).   \nWhile the law mandates dismissal on any of these grounds, the Court is obliged to \nconstrue pro se  pleadings liberally, Harris v. Mills , 572 F.3d 66, 72 (2d Cir. 2009), and interpret \nthem to raise the “strongest arguments that they suggest .”  Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons , \n470 F.3d 471, 474- 75 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  A claim is \nfrivolous when it “lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.”  Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. \n319, 325 (1989), abrogated on other grounds Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544 (2007); Case 5:24-cv-00438-GTS-TWD   Document 7   Filed 05/06/24   Page 4 of 765 see also Denton v. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 33 (1992) (holding “a finding of factual \nfrivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholl y \nincredible”); Livingston, 141 F.3d at 437.   \nTo survive dismissal for failure to state a claim, a complaint must contain a short and \nplain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  \nThis short and pl ain statement of the claim must be “plausible on its face.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at \n570.  “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the m isconduct alleged.”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The statement of the claim must do more than \npresent “an unadorned, the -defendant -harmed -me accusation.”  Id.  It must “give the defendant \nfair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 \n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  \nIn determining whether a complaint states a claim upon which relief may be granted, “the \ncourt must accept the material facts  alleged in the complaint as true and construe all reasonable \ninferences in the plaintiff’s favor.”  Hernandez v. Coughlin, 18 F.3d 133, 136 (2d Cir. 1994) (citations omitted).   However, “t he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations \ncontained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  \n“Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.”  Id .   \nMoreover, a court should not dismiss a pro s e complaint “without granting leave to \namend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid \nclaim might be stated.”   Gomez v. USAA Fed. Sav. Bank , 171 F.3d 794, 795 (2d Cir. 1999) \n(citation and internal quotation ma rks omitted).   However, an opportunity to amend is not Case 5:24-cv-00438-GTS-TWD   Document 7   Filed 05/06/24   Page 5 of 766 required where “the problem with [the plaintiff’s] causes of action is substantive” such that \n“better pleading will not cure it.”   Cuoco v. Moritsugu, 222 F.3d 99, 112 (2d Cir. 2000). \nV. ANALYSIS  \n First, “ [a] police department cannot sue or be sued because it does not exist separate and \napart from the municipality and does not have its own legal identity.”  Baker v. Willett, 42 F. Supp. 2d 192, 198 (N.D.N.Y. 1999) (dismissing claims against county s heriff’s department) \n(citations omitted); see also Davis v. Lynbrook Police Dep’t , 224 F. Supp. 2d 463, 477 (E.D.N.Y. \n2002) (“Under New York law, departments that are merely administrative arms of a municipality do not have a legal identity separate and ap art from the municipality and, therefore, cannot sue or \nbe sued.”) (citations omitted); Jenkins v. Liadka , No. 5:10- CV-1223 (GTS/DEP), 2012 WL \n4052286, at *9 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 13, 2012) (“Because the Syracuse Police Department is merely an administrative arm of the City of Syracuse, it is not a proper defendant in this case.”).\n3  \nBecause the Watertown Police Department and the Criminal Investigations Division or Department thereof cannot be sued, Plaintiff’s complaint should be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).  See, e.g., La Grande v. Town of Bethlehem Police Dep’t , No. 1:08-\nCV-0738 (LEK/DRH), 2009 WL 2868231, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Sept. 1, 2009) (“Since the \nBethlehem Police Department cannot be sued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Plaintiff’s \n \n3 A municipality itself may be named as a defendant in certain circumstances.  See generally, \nMonell v. Dep’t of Social Services , 436 U.S. 658 (1978).  “[A] local government may not be sued \nunder § 1983 for an injury inflicted solely by its employees or agents.  Instead, it is when \nexecution of a government’s policy or custom . . . inflicts the injury that the government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.”  Id . at 694; see also , e.g., LeTray v. City of Watertown , No. \n5:20- CV-1194 (FJS/TWD), 2024 WL 1107903, at *8 (N.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2024) (“a municipality \nis liable under § 1983 if its policy causes a constitutional injury.”) (citation omitted).  Here, however, nothing in Plaintiff’s complaint suggests action taken pursuant to a municipal policy, custom, or practice, therefore, a claim of municipal liability under Monell  would not be \nappropriate. Case 5:24-cv-00438-GTS-TWD   Document 7   Filed 05/06/24   Page 6 of 767 Com plaint is dismissed as against the Town of Bethlehem Police Department.”); Hester v.

SUDDABY , District Judge.\n*1 Currently before the Court, in this pro se  civil rights\naction filed by Sylvia Jenkins (“Plaintiff”) against Mr. Liadka,\nMr. Sands, John Doe, and Syracuse Police Department\n(“Defendants”), is Defendants' motion to dismiss Plaintiff's\nComplaint for insufficient service of process pursuant to\nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(5)  and/or for failure to state a claim\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) . (Dkt. No. 13.) For the\nreasons set forth below, Defendants' motion is granted in part\nand denied in part.\nI. RELEV ANT BACKGROUND\nA. Plaintiff's Complaint\nGenerally, construed with the utmost of special liberality,\nPlaintiff's Complaint asserts three claims against Defendants\narising from an investigatory stop in September 2010, in\nSyracuse, New York: (1) a claim that three Syracuse Police\nOfficers unreasonably searched her in violation of the Fourth\nAmendment; (2) a claim that they unlawfully seized, and\nfailed to return, her personal property in violation of theFourth, Fifth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments; and (3) a claim\nthat they subjected her to excessive force in violation of\nthe Fourth Amendment. ( See generally  Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s\nCompl].)\nGenerally, in support of these claims, Plaintiff alleges as\nfollows: (1) on the evening of September 9, 2010, she was\nstopped on Butternut Street in the City of Syracuse by\ntwo officers, who questioned her regarding a call they had\nreceived; (2) when she told the two police officers that she\ndid not know what they were talking about and “attempted\nto go on about [her] business,” the officers became “uptight,\nrude, [and] abnormal in their conversations [and] behavior,”\nand threatened her; (3) the officers then proceeded to conduct\na search of “all [of Plaintiff and her] personal property,”\nand, in the process of doing so, twisted her arm and forced\nher onto the front of their police vehicle; (4) a third police\nofficer arrived, and she was assaulted by all three officers\n(hereinafter “Defendants”), who hit her on the back and threw\nher onto the police vehicle; (5) following the deprivation on\nSeptember 9, 2010, Defendants denied her a post-deprivation\nremedy through a combination of threats, intimidation and/\nor nonresponsiveness; and (6) Defendants took these actions\nagainst her intentionally because they did not personally like\nher, given her previous interactions with the Syracuse Police\nDepartment. ( Id.)\nPlaintiff further alleges that, as a result of this incident,\nshe suffered various injuries and losses, including (1) a\n“tremendous setback in already trying to recover in an [sic]\ngrave overall manner of my life [and] lifestyle involving\nofficials internally [and] externally,” (2) head and back pain,\nand mental suffering, (3) loss of personal property, and, (4)\nloss of employment. ( Id.) As relief, Plaintiff requests an award\nof twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) in damages. ( Id. at ¶ 6.)\nFamiliarity with the remaining factual allegations supporting\nPlaintiff's three claims is assumed in this Decision and Order,\nwhich is intended primarily for review by the parties. (See\ngenerally  Dkt. No. 1.)\nB. Defendants' Motion\n*2 On May 6, 2011, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss.\n(Dkt. No. 13, Attach 2.) Generally, in support of their motion,\nDefendants assert the following two arguments: (1) because\nthe Complaint was not served within the time allowed by\nFed.R.Civ.P. 4  or Local Rule 4.1 of the Local Rules of Practice\nfor this Court, the Court lacks jurisdiction over Defendants in\naccordance with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 ; and (2) the Complaint failsCase 5:24-cv-00438-GTS-TWD   Document 7   Filed 05/06/24   Page 10 of 76Jenkins v. Liadka, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2012)\n2012 WL 4052286\n © 2024 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, because\n(a) the Complaint fails to identify what constitutional rights\nPlaintiff is attempting to vindicate, (b) even if the Complaint\nhas sufficiently identified a constitutional violation, the\nComplaint fails to allege facts plausibly suggesting the\npersonal involvement of the individual Defendants in any\nsuch constitutional violation, (c) the City of Syracuse Police\nDepartment does not have the legal capacity to be sued, (d)\neven if Plaintiff's Complaint can be liberally construed as\nattempting to assert a claim against the City of Syracuse,\nthe Complaint fails to allege facts plausibly suggesting that\nthe individual Defendants' actions the result of a city policy\nor custom sufficient to confer municipal liability upon the\nCity, (e) the Fifth Amendment does not govern a plaintiff's\ndeprivation-of-property claim against state actors, (f) the\nComplaint fails to allege facts plausibly suggesting that force\nwas used or that if force was used it was excessive for\npurposes of a Fourth Amendment claim, and (g) based on\nPlaintiff's factual allegations, Defendants Liadka and Sands\nare protected from liability as a matter of law by the doctrine\nof qualified immunity. ( See generally  Dkt. No. 13, Attach. 2.)\nOn June 2, 2011, Plaintiff filed a response to Defendants'\nmotion. Generally, Plaintiff's response, which is handwritten\nand three pages in length, states that she “definitely oppose[s]\n[Defendants'] request” for the dismissal of her Complaint.\n(See generally  Dkt. No. 17.) However, Plaintiff's response\ndoes not address the legal arguments asserted by Defendants\nfor the dismissal of Plaintiff's Complaint. ( Compare  Dkt.\nNo. 17 with Dkt. No. 13, Attach. 2.) Although Plaintiff's\nresponse was submitted two days after the expiration of\nthe responsedeadline, the Court has accepted it, out of an\nextension of special solicitude to her as a pro se  civil rights\nlitigant.\nIn addition, Plaintiff has filed three letters to the Court on the\nfollowing dates: July 6, 2011, August 22, 2011, and January\n13, 2012. (Dkt. No. 18–20.) Generally, these letters contain\nassertions that Plaintiff believes that the police are following\nher, treating her negatively, and responding unsatisfactorily to\nher telephone calls. ( Id.) To the extent that these three letters\nare intended to constitute papers in opposition to Defendants'\nmotion, the Court will not consider them, because (1) they\nare not responsive to the motion, and/or (2) they were not\nsubmitted in a timely manner. Moreover, to the extent that\nthese three letters are intended to constitute a request for\nrelief, the Court will not consider them, because do not\nstate the relief sought, state with particularity the grounds\nfor seeking the order, and attach a memorandum of law andaffidavit, as required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b)  and Local Rule 7.1\nof the Local Rules of Practice for this Court.\nII. RELEV ANT LEGAL STANDARDS\nA. Legal Standard Governing Motions to Dismiss for\nInsufficient Service of Process\n*3 Rule 4(m) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nprovides, in pertinent part, as follows:\nIf a defendant is not served within\n120 days after the complaint is filed,\nthe court-on motion or its own after\nnotice to the plaintiff-must dismiss\nthe action without prejudice against\nthat defendant or order that service be\nmade within a specified time. But if\nthe plaintiff shows good cause for the\nfailure, the court must extend the time\nfor service for an appropriate period.\nFed.R.Civ.P. 4(m) .\nThe Local Rules of Practice for this Court shorten the service\nrequirements under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 . Specifically, Local Rule\n4.1(b)  requires “service of process upon all defendants within\nsixty (60) days of the filing of the complaint. This expedited\nservice is necessary to ensure adequate time for pretrial\ndiscovery and motion practice. In no event shall service of\nprocess be completed after the time specified in Fed.R.Civ.P.\n4.” N.D.N.Y . L.R. 4.1(b).\nB. Legal Standard Governing Motions to Dismiss for\nFailure to State Claim\nIt has long been understood that a defendant may base\na motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted on either or both of two\ngrounds: (1) a challenge to the “sufficiency of the pleading”\nunder Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) ; or (2) a challenge to the legal\ncognizability of the claim. Jackson v. Onondaga Cnty.,  549\nF.Supp.2d 204, 211, nn. 15–16 (N.D.N.Y .2008)  (McAvoy, J.,\nadopting Report–Recommendation on de novo  review).\nBecause such motions are often based on the first ground,\na few words on that ground are appropriate. Rule 8(a)(2) of\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  requires that a pleadingCase 5:24-cv-00438-GTS-TWD   Document 7   Filed 05/06/24   Page 11 of 76Jenkins v. Liadka, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2012)\n2012 WL 4052286\n © 2024 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3contain “a short and plain  statement of the claim showing\nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a) (2)\n[emphasis added]. In the Court's view, this tension between\npermitting a “short and plain statement” and requiring that\nthe statement “show[ ]” an entitlement to relief is often at the\nheart of misunderstandings that occur regarding the pleading\nstandard established by Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) .\nOn the one hand, the Supreme Court has long characterized\nthe “short and plain” pleading standard under Fed.R.Civ.P.\n8(a)(2)  as “simplified” and “liberal.” Jackson,  549 F.Supp.2d\nat 212, n. 20 (citing Supreme Court case) . On the other\nhand, the Supreme Court has held that, by requiring the\nabove-described “showing,” the pleading standard under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)  requires that the pleading contain a\nstatement that “give[s] the defendant fair notice  of what the\nplaintiff's claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”\nJackson,  549 F.Supp.2d at 212, n. 17 (citing Supreme Court\ncases)  (emphasis added).\nThe Supreme Court has explained that such fair notice  has\nthe important purpose of “enabl[ing] the adverse party to\nanswer and prepare for trial” and “facilitat[ing] a proper\ndecision on the merits” by the court. Jackson,  549 F.Supp.2d\nat 212, n. 18 (citing Supreme Court cases) ; Rusyniak v.\nGensini,  629 F.Supp.2d 203, 213 & n. 32 (N.D.N.Y .2009)\n(Suddaby, J.) (citing Second Circuit cases). For this reason, as\none commentator has correctly observed, the “liberal” notice\npleading standard “has its limits.” 2 Moore's Federal Practice\n§ 12.34[1][b] at 12–61 (3d ed.2003). For example, numerous\nSupreme Court and Second Circuit decisions exist holding\nthat a pleading has failed to meet the “liberal” notice pleading\nstandard. Rusyniak,  629 F. Supp .2d at 213, n. 22  (citing\nSupreme Court and Second Circuit cases); see also Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal,  556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949–52, 173 L.Ed.2d\n868 (2009) .\n*4 Most notably, in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,  the\nSupreme Court reversed an appellate decision holding that a\ncomplaint had stated an actionable antitrust claim under 15\nU.S.C. § 1 . Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,  550 U.S. 544, 127\nS.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) . In doing so, the Court\n“retire[d]” the famous statement by the Court in Conley v.\nGibson,  355 U.S. 41, 45–46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) ,\nthat “a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state\na claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can\nprove no set of facts in support of his claim which would\nentitle him to relief.” Twombly,  127 S.Ct. at 1968–69 . Rather\nthan turning on the conceivability  of an actionable claim,the Court clarified, the “fair notice” standard turns on the\nplausibility  of an actionable claim. Id. at 1965–74.  The Court\nexplained that, while this does not mean that a pleading need\n“set out in detail the facts upon which [the claim is based],”\nit does mean that the pleading must contain at least “some\nfactual allegation[s].” Id . at 1965.  More specifically, the\n“[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief\nabove the speculative level [to a plausible level],” assuming\n(of course) that all the allegations in the complaint are true.\nId.1\n1It should be emphasized that Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 's\nplausibility standard, explained in Twombly,  was\nin no way retracted or diminished by the Supreme\nCourt's decision (two weeks later) in Erickson\nv. Pardus,  in which (when reviewing a pro se\npleading) the Court stated, “Specific facts are not\nnecessary” to successfully state a claim under\nFed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) . Erickson v. Pardus,  551 U.S.\n89, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007)\n[emphasis added]. That statement was merely an\nabbreviation of the often-repeated point of law-first\noffered in Conley  and repeated in Twombly -that a\npleading need not “set out in detail  the facts upon\nwhich [the claim is based]” in order to successfully\nstate a claim. Twombly,  127 S.Ct. 1965, n. 3 (citing\nConley,  355 U.S. at 47)  [emphasis added]. That\nstatement did not mean that all pleadings may\nachieve the requirement of “fair notice” without\never alleging any facts whatsoever. Clearly, there\nmust still be enough fact set out (however set out,\nwhether in detail or in a generalized fashion) to\nraise a right to relief above the speculative level to\na plausible level. See Rusyniak,  629 F.Supp.2d at\n214 & n. 35  (explaining holding in Erickson  ).\nAs for the nature of what is “plausible,” the Supreme Court\nexplained that “[a] claim has facial plausibility when the\nplaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw\nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the\nmisconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal,  556 U.S. 662, 129\nS.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) . “[D]etermining\nwhether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief ... [is]\na context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to\ndraw on its judicial experience and common sense.... [W]here\nthe well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more\nthan the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has\nalleged-but it has not show[n]-that the pleader is entitled to\nrelief.” Iqbal,  129 S.Ct. at 1950  [internal quotation marks andCase 5:24-cv-00438-GTS-TWD   Document 7   Filed 05/06/24   Page 12 of 76Jenkins v. Liadka, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2012)\n2012 WL 4052286\n © 2024 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 4citations omitted]. However, while the plausibility standard\n“asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant\nhas acted unlawfully,” id., it “does not impose a probability\nrequirement.” Twombly,  550 U.S. at 556 .\nBecause of this requirement of factual allegations plausibly\nsuggesting an entitlement to relief, “the tenet that a court must\naccept as true all of the allegations contained in the complaint\nis inapplicable to legal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of\nthe elements of a cause of action, supported by merely\nconclusory statements, do not suffice.” Iqbal,  129 S.Ct. at\n1949 . Similarly, a pleading that only “tenders naked assertions\ndevoid of further factual enhancement” will not suffice. Iqbal,\n129 S.Ct. at 1949  (internal citations and alterations omitted).\nRule 8  “demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-\nunlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Id.\nThis pleading standard applies even to pro se  litigants. While\nthe special leniency afforded to pro se  civil rights litigants\nsomewhat loosens the procedural rules governing the form\nof pleadings (as the Second Circuit has observed), it does\nnot completely relieve a pro se  plaintiff of the duty to satisfy\nthe pleading standards set forth in Fed.R.Civ.P. 8 , 10 and\n12.2 Rather, as both the Supreme Court and Second Circuit\nhave repeatedly recognized, the requirements set forth in\nFed.R.Civ.P. 8 , 10 and 12 are procedural rules that even pro se\ncivil rights plaintiffs must follow.3 Stated more simply, when\na plaintiff is proceeding pro se,  “all normal rules of pleading\nare not absolutely suspended.” Jackson,  549 F.Supp.2d at 214,\nn. 28 .\n2See Vega v. Artus,  610 F.Supp.2d 185, 196 & nn.\n8–9 (N.D.N . Y .2009)  (Suddaby, J.) (citing Second\nCircuit cases); Rusyniak,  629 F.Supp.2d at 214 &\nn. 34 (citing Second Circuit cases) .\n3See Vega,  610 F.Supp.2d at 196, n. 10  (citing\nSupreme Court and Second Circuit cases);\nRusyniak,  629 F.Supp.2d at 214 & n. 34 (citing\nSecond Circuit cases) .\n*5 Finally, a few words are appropriate regarding what\ndocuments are considered on a motion to dismiss for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) . The court may consider\nthe following documents without triggering the summary\njudgment standard: “(1) documents attached as an exhibit\nto the complaint or answer, (2) documents incorporated by\nreference into the complaint (and provided by the parties),(3) documents that, although not incorporated by reference,\nare “integral” to the complaint, or (4) any matter of which\nthe court can take judicial notice for the factual background\nof the case.” Planck v. Schenectady Cnty.,  12–CV–0336,\n2012 WL 1977972, at *5 (N.D.N.Y . June 1, 2012)  (Suddaby,\nJ.). Moreover, “a pro se plaintiff's papers in response to a\ndefendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim may\nbe considered as effectively amending the allegations of [her]\ncomplaint-to the extent those papers are consistent with the\nallegations in the complaint.” Planck,  2012 WL 1977972, at\n*5.\nC. Legal Standard Governing Unopposed Motions\nIn this District, when a non-movant fails to oppose a legal\nargument asserted by a movant in support of a motion,\nthe movant's burden with regard to that argument has been\nlightened such that, in order to succeed on that argument,\nthe movant need only show that the argument possesses\nfacial merit, which has appropriately been characterized as\na “modest” burden. See N.D.N.Y . L.R. 7.1(b) (3) (“Where a\nproperly filed motion is unopposed and the Court determines\nthat the moving party has met its burden to demonstrate\nentitlement to the relief requested therein....”); Rusyniak\nv. Gensini,  07–CV–0279, 2009 WL 3672105, at *1, n.\n1 (N.D.N.Y .Oct.30, 2009)  (Suddaby, J.) (collecting cases);\nEste–Green v. Astrue,  09–CV–0722, 2009 WL 2473509, at\n*2 & n. 3 (N.D.N.Y . Aug.7, 2009)  (Suddaby, J.) (collecting\ncases).\nD. Legal Standards Governing Plaintiff's Claims\nBecause the Court has, in its Decision and Order of March\n7, 2011, addressed the relevant points of law contained in\nthe legal standards governing Plaintiff's claims in this action,\nthe Court will not again recite, in their entirety, those legal\nstandards in this Decision and Order, 9 which is intended\nprimarily for review by the parties.

Defense of Lack of Separate Identity\n“Under New York law, departments that are merely\nadministrative arms of a municipality do not have a legal\nidentity separate and apart from the municipality, and\ntherefore, cannot sue or be sued.” Davis v.

Defense of Limited Municipal Liability\n*6 It is well established that “[a] municipality may not be\nheld liable in a Section 1983 action for the conduct of a\nlower-echelon employee solely on the basis of respondeat\nsuperior. ”4 “Rather, to establish municipal liability under §\n1983 for unconstitutional acts by a municipality's employees,\na plaintiff must show that the violation of [his or] her\nconstitutional rights resulted from a municipal custom or\npolicy .”5 “Thus, to hold a [municipality] liable under § 1983\nfor the unconstitutional actions of its employees, a plaintiff\nis required to ... prove three elements: (1) an official policy\nor custom that (2) causes the plaintiff to be subjected to (3) a\ndenial of a constitutional right.”6\n4Powell v.

Defense of Qualified Immunity\n“Once qualified immunity is pleaded, plaintiff's complaint\nwill be dismissed unless defendant's alleged conduct,\nwhen committed, violated ‘clearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown.’ “ Williams v. Smith,  781 F.2d 319, 322 (2d Cir.1986)\n(quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald,  457 U.S. 800, 815 [1982] ).\nAs a result, a qualified immunity inquiry in a civil rights\ncase generally involves two issues: (1) “whether the facts,\nviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff establish a\nconstitutional violation”; and (2) “whether it would be clear\nto a reasonable [official] that his conduct was unlawful in the\nsituation confronted.” Sira v. Morton,  380 F.3d 57, 68–69 (2dCir.2004)  [citations omitted], accord, Higazy v. Templeton,\n505 F.3d 161, 169, n. 8 (2d Cir.2007)  [citations omitted].\nIn determining the second issue (i.e., whether it would be\nclear to a reasonable official that his conduct was unlawful in\nthe situation confronted), courts in this circuit consider three\nfactors:\n(1) whether the right in question was\ndefined with ‘reasonable specificity’;\n(2) whether the decisional law of\nthe Supreme Court and the applicable\ncircuit court support the existence\nof the right in question; and (3)\nwhether under preexisting law a\nreasonable defendant official would\nhave understood that his or her acts\nwere unlawful.\n*7 Jermosen v.

Templeton,  505 F.3d 161, 169–70 (2d Cir.2007)  [citations\nomitted].10 This “objective reasonableness” part of the test\nis met if “officers of reasonable competence could disagree\non [the legality of defendant's actions].” Malley v.

ANALYSIS\nA. Whether Plaintiff's Complaint Should Be\nDismissed for Failure to Serve Process in Timely\nManner\nAfter carefully considering the matter, the Court must\nanswer this question in the negative. By Defendants' own\ncalculations, Plaintiff's Complaint was served on April 18,\n2011–a mere 42 days after the Court granted Plaintiff's motion\nto proceed in forma pauperis,  approved the filing of herComplaint, and directed the Clerk of the Court to issue\nsummonses and forward them with the Complaint to the\nUnited States Marshal's Service, for service on Defendants.\n(Dkt. No. 5 [Decision and Order filed March 7, 2011].)\nIndeed, Defendants acknowledge that Plaintiff completed the\nCivil Summonses and USM285 form, and returned them to\nthe Clerk's Office (so that the Clerk's Office could forward\nthem to the U.S. Marshal's Service for service of Plaintiff's\nComplaint) less than eight days after receiving them from the\nClerk's Office. (Dkt. No. 13, Attach. 1, at ¶¶ 6–7; Dkt. No. 13,\nAttach. 2, at 9 [attaching page “8” of Defs.' Memo. of Law];\nsee also  Dkt. Nos. 6, 8.) After that point in time, service was\nlargely if not entirely outside of Plaintiff's control.\nUnder the circumstances, the Court finds that good cause\nexists to extend the deadline for service by 42 days. The\nCourt notes that a contrary conclusion (e.g., a conclusion\nthat Plaintiff had to serve her Complaint by December 13,\n2010 pursuant to Local Rule 4.1 , or even February 11, 2011\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 ) would render meaningless the\nCourt's directive to the Clerk of the Court, on March 5, 2011,\nto take sufficient action to enable the United States Marshal's\nService to effect service for Plaintiff.\nB. Whether Plaintiff's Complaint Should Be Dismissed\nfor Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can\nBe Granted\n1. Whether Plaintiff's Complaint Should Be\nDismissed for Failing to Sufficiently Identify What\nConstitutional Rights She Is Attempting to Vindicate\n*8 After carefully considering the matter, the Court must\nanswer this question also in the negative. In construing the\npleadings of a pro se  civil rights litigant in this Circuit, a\ndistrict court's imagination should be limited only by the\nplaintiff's factual allegations, not by the legal claims set out in\nhis or her pleadings. See Phillips v. Girdich,  408 F.3d 124, 130\n(2d Cir.2005)  (“We leave it for the district court to determine\nwhat other claims, if any, Phillips has raised. In so doing, the\ncourt's imagination should be limited only by Phillips' factual\nallegations, not by the legal claims set out in his pleadings.”).\nHere, based on Plaintiff's (albeit scant and confused) factual\nallegations, the Court can imagine that she is attempting\nto assert the following three claims: (1) a claim of an\nunreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment; (2) a\nclaim of an unlawful seizure of, and failure to return, her\npersonal property under the Fourth, Fifth and/or FourteenthCase 5:24-cv-00438-GTS-TWD   Document 7   Filed 05/06/24   Page 16 of 76Jenkins v. Liadka, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2012)\n2012 WL 4052286\n © 2024 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 8Amendments; and (3) a claim of excessive force under the\nFourth Amendment.\n2. Whether Plaintiff's Claims Against the Individual\nDefendants Should Be Dismissed for Failing to\nAllege Facts Plausibly Suggesting Their Personal\nInvolvement in the Constitutional Violations Alleged\nAfter carefully considering the matter, the Court answers\nthis question in the affirmative for the reasons stated by\nDefendants in their memorandum of law. (Dkt. No. 13,\nAttach. 2, at 13 [attaching page “12” of Defs.' Memo. of\nLaw].) The Court would add only the following three brief\npoints.\nFirst, at the very least, Defendants have met the lightened\nburden that was created by Plaintiff's failure to respond to this\nargument for dismissal. See, supra,  Part III.C. of this Decision\nand Order.13 Second, in any event, the Court would reach\nthe same conclusion even if it were to subject Defendants'\nargument to the more rigorous scrutiny appropriate for a\ncontested argument. Third, and finally, even when construed\nwith the utmost of special liberality, the Complaint does not\nidentify the precise location of the incident, which officers\nwere responsible for violating her rights, how she suffered the\nhead injury  she alleges, what property was taken from her, and\nhow Defendants frustrated her efforts to recover that property.\nSee Vogeler v. Colbath,  04–CV–6071, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n44658, at *29, 2005 WL 2482549 (S.D.N.Y . Oct. 6, 2005)\n(“Plaintiffs must also allege ... the personal involvement of\nthe Defendant in the actions underlying their claim.”).14\n13Under the circumstances, the Court finds that\nPlaintiff had sufficient notice of the consequences\nof failing to respond to the arguments asserted in\nDefendants' motion. For example, on October 14,\n2010, Plaintiff was given a courtesy copy of the\nDistrict's Pro Se  Handbook and a courtesy copy of\nthe Local Rules of Practice for the Northern District\nof New York. (Dkt. No. 4.) In addition, on May\n6, 2011, Defendants advised Plaintiff of her need\nto respond to their arguments. (Dkt. No. 15.) Also,\nPlaintiff had extensive experience as a pro se  civil\nrights litigant in this District, before responding to\nthe motion in question. See, infra,  Part III.D. of this\nDecision and Order.\n14Indeed, the Court notes that one of the officers\nthat Plaintiff lists in her Complaint has not beenidentified. In a prior decision by the Court, Plaintiff\nwas ordered to take reasonable steps to ascertain the\nidentity of the unnamed officer, immediately notify\nthe Court, amend her complaint to include the\nidentity of the third Defendant, and also to have that\nofficer served. (Dkt. No. 5, at 14.) Because Plaintiff\nhas not done so, her alleged physical injuries\nremain attributable to an unidentified person.\nFor all of these alternative reasons, Plaintiff's claims against\nthe individual Defendants are dismissed.\n3. Whether the Syracuse Police Department Should Be\nDismissed as a Defendant\nAfter carefully considering the matter, the Court answers\nthis question in the affirmative for the reasons stated by\nDefendants in their memorandum of law. (Dkt. No. 13, Attach\n2, at 13.) The Court would add only the following three brief\npoints.\n*9 First, at the very least, Defendants have met the\nlightened burden that was created by Plaintiff's failure to\nrespond to this argument for dismissal. Second, in any\nevent, the Court would reach the same conclusion even if it\nwere to subject Defendants' argument to the more rigorous\nscrutiny appropriate for a contested argument. Third, and\nfinally, “as Plaintiff has been told several times, under New\nYork State law, departments, like the Onondaga County\nSheriff's Department, that are merely administrative arms of\na municipality, do not have a legal identity separate from\nthe municipality and may not sue or be sued.” Jenkins\nv.

Cnty. of Sullivan,  07–CV–\n0667, 2012 WL 1129373, at *24 [S.D.N.Y . March 30, 2012]\n). Because the Syracuse Police Department is merely an\nadministrative arm of the City of Syracuse, it is not a proper\ndefendant in this case. The real party in interest is the City of\nSyracuse itself.\nFor all of these alternative reasons, the Syracuse Police\nDepartment dismissed as a Defendant.\n4.

STEWART , United States Magistrate Judge\n*1 The Clerk has sent for review a civil Complaint filed\nby Plaintiff. Dkt. No. 1, Compl. Plaintiff has not paid the\nfiling fee, but instead submitted a Motion to Proceed in forma\npauperis  (“IFP”). Dkt. No. 2, IFP App. By separate Order,\nthis Court granted Plaintiff's Application to Proceed IFP. Also\npending are Motions for the Appointment of Counsel an to\nObtain and ECF Login. Dkt. Nos. 3 & 5. Now, in accordance\nwith 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) , the Court will sua sponte  review\nthe sufficiency of the Complaint.\nI. DISCUSSION\nA. Pleading Requirements\nSection 1915(e) of Title 28 of the United States Code  directs\nthat, when a plaintiff seeks to proceed in forma pauperis ,\n“the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court\ndetermines that ... the action or appeal (i) is frivolous or\nmalicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be\ngranted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant\nwho is immune from such relief.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) .\nThus, it is a court's responsibility to determine that a plaintiff\nmay properly maintain his complaint before permitting him\nto proceed further with his action.In reviewing a pro se  complaint, this Court has a duty to\nshow liberality toward pro se  litigants, see Nance v. Kelly ,\n912 F.2d 605, 606 (2d Cir. 1990) , and should exercise\n“extreme caution ... in ordering sua sponte  dismissal of a\npro se complaint before  the adverse party has been served\nand both parties (but particularly the plaintiff) have had an\nopportunity to respond.” Anderson v. Coughlin , 700 F.2d 37,\n41 (2d Cir. 1983)  (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).\nTherefore, a court should not dismiss a complaint if the\nplaintiff has stated “enough facts to state a claim to relief\nthat is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly ,\n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) . “A claim has facial plausibility\nwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the\ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant\nis liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556\nU.S. 662, 678 (2009)  (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550\nU.S. at 556 ). Although the court should construe the factual\nallegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, “the\ntenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations\ncontained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.”\nId. “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action,\nsupported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id.\n(citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 ). “[W]here\nthe well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more\nthan the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has\nalleged – but it has not ‘show[n]’–‘that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.’ ” Id. at 679  (quoting FED. R. CIV . P.  8(a)(2) ).\nA pleading that only “tenders naked assertions devoid of\nfurther factual enhancement” will not suffice. Id. at 678-79\n(citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 , for the\nproposition that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8  “demands\nmore than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-\nme accusation” ). Allegations that “are so vague as to fail\nto give the defendants adequate notice of the claims against\nthem” are subject to dismissal. Sheehy v.

D'Agostino , U.S. District Judge:\n*1 Plaintiff commenced this action on February 25, 2020,\nagainst the United States of America asserting the following\nclaims: (1) personal injury; (2) assault and battery; (3)\ndefamation; (4) general damages; (5) intentional infliction\nof mental distress and physical torture; and (6) wage loss.\nSee Dkt. No. 1. In a Report-Recommendation and Order\ndated March 17, 2020, Magistrate Judge Stewart reviewed\nthe sufficiency of the complaint and recommended that\nthe Court dismiss this action with prejudice. See Dkt.\nNo. 7. Specifically, Magistrate Judge Stewart found that\nPlaintiff's claims, which are brought against the United States\nof America, are subject to dismissal on the grounds of\nsovereign immunity. See id.  at 4-6. Neither party has objected\nto Magistrate Judge Stewart's Report-Recommendation and\nOrder.\nSection 1915(e)(2)(B) directs that, when a plaintiff seeks to\nproceed IFP, “(2) ... the court shall dismiss the case at any time\nif the court determines that - ... (B) the action ... (i) is frivolous\nor malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may\nbe granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant\nwho is immune from such relief.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) .\n“[I]n a pro se  case, the court must view the submissions by a\nmore lenient standard than that accorded to ‘formal pleadings\ndrafted by lawyers.’ ” Govan v. Campbell , 289 F. Supp. 2d\n289, 295 (N.D.N.Y . 2003)  (quoting Haines v. Kerner , 404U.S. 519, 520 (1972) ). The Second Circuit has held that\nthe court is obligated to “make reasonable allowances to\nprotect pro se  litigants” from inadvertently forfeiting legal\nrights merely because they lack a legal education. Id. (quoting\nTraguth v. Zuck , 710 F.2d 90, 95 (2d Cir. 1983) ).\nWhen a party files specific objections to a magistrate\njudge's report-recommendation, the district court makes a\n“de novo  determination of those portions of the report or\nspecified proposed findings or recommendations to which\nobjection is made.” 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) . However, when\na party declines to file objections or files “[g]eneral or\nconclusory objections or objections which merely recite\nthe same arguments [presented] to the magistrate judge,”\nthe court reviews those recommendations for clear error.\nO'Diah v. Mawhir , No. 9:08-CV-322, 2011 WL 933846, *1\n(N.D.N.Y . Mar. 16, 2011)  (citations and footnote omitted);\nsee also  McAllan v. Von Essen , 517 F. Supp. 2d 672, 679\n(S.D.N.Y . 2007) . After the appropriate review, “the court may\naccept, reject or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or\nrecommendations made by the magistrate [judge].” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 636(b)(1) .\nIn the present matter, the Court finds that Magistrate Judge\nStewart correctly determined that Plaintiff's complaint should\nbe dismissed with prejudice. “Well-established principles of\nsovereign immunity bar suit against the United States unless\nit consents to be sued, the existence of such consent being a\nprerequisite for jurisdiction.” Pietrangelo v. U.S. Dist. Court\nVermont , 223 Fed. Appx. 20, 21 (2d Cir. 2007)  (citing United\nStates v. Mitchell , 463 U.S. 206, 212 (1983) ). “The waiver\nof sovereign immunity is a prerequisite to subject-matter\njurisdiction.”  Presidential Gardens Assocs. v. U.S. ex rel.\nSec'y of Hous. & Urban Dev. , 175 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir.\n1999) .\n*2 As Magistrate Judge Stewart correctly determined,\nPlaintiff makes no contention that any waiver of immunity\napplies to the allegations set forth in his complaint. Moreover,\nalthough the Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”) provides\na limited waiver of sovereign immunity from suit for tort\nclaims against the United States, it has strict exhaustion\nrequirements and the burden is on the plaintiff to both plead\nand prove compliance with the FTCA's statutory exhaustion\nrequirements. See In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig. ,\n818 F.2d 210, 214 (2d Cir. 1987) . Plaintiff's complaint\nneither mentions the FTCA nor alleges compliance with its\nexhaustion requirements. See Pope v.

MDC Detention  Ctr., No. 17-CV-3768,\n2018 WL 472810, *2 (E.D.N.Y . Jan. 17, 2018) ). As such, the\nCourt dismisses Plaintiff's complaint.1\n1Since Plaintiff's complaint can be liberally\nconstrued as attempting to bring a claim under the\nFTCA and because it is unclear from the complaint\nwhether Plaintiff may still timely exhaust his\nadministrative remedies, the dismissal will be\nwithout prejudice.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Eliezer Taveras, a pro se plaintiff, filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), Alpine Towing, and others, alleging wrongful towing based on incorrect toll charges linked with a defective SunPass transponder. The court recommended dismissing the second amended complaint but allowed Taveras a final chance to amend his claims. The case mentions AI in passing, with defendants questioning if Taveras used AI to draft a filing due to stylistic discrepancies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants violated Mr. Taveras's civil rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, along with violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and whether these claims are adequately stated under the law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court recommended dismissing the Second Amended Complaint without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can re-file an amended complaint if he corrects the deficiencies. The court also found that FDOT could claim Eleventh Amendment immunity, and claims against Secretary Perdue, in his official capacity, were redundant.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you got a parking ticket, but you think it was given unfairly because the toll device in your car wasn't working right. You take this issue to a higher authority, but your paperwork wasn't quite right. The judge now says, \"Let's hit pause. Fix the errors in your paperwork, and you can try again to prove your point.\" Meanwhile, the judge tells you that you can't sue certain people because they have special protection under the law, and it's no use trying to include them unless you're sure about your claims. The judge also suspects you might’ve used a computer program for your paperwork because it looks like it's written in a way that's not the usual for you.",

Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 1 of 452  The SAC alleges violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count I) and the Fair Debt \nCollection Practice s Act (“FDCPA”), 15 U.S.C. § 1692, et seq.  (Count II) against \nAlpin e/Saravia; declaratory relief pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201–02 (Count III) against FDOT ; and injunctive relief (Count IV)  and violation s of 18 \nU.S.C. § 241 (Counts V and VI) against all Defendants . \n Defendants filed a joint motion [ECF No. 88] seeking to dismiss the SAC.

The SAC  [ECF No. 85] should be dismissed  in its entirety  but without prejudice . \nPlaintiff should be provided with one final opportunity to amend his pleading (if \nfactually possible) . \n \n2 In their reply, Defendants raise the issue of whether Plaintiff (a pro se litigant) \nrelied on artificial intelligence to draft his response , noting “stylistic difference[s]” \nbetween the response and other filings and citation (or miscitation) to case law which \ndoes not exist.

Factual Background3 \nThe SAC alleges that FDOT “is an executive agency of the State of Florida having \nthe powers and duties set forth in Section 334.044, Florida Statutes, and is authorized to \nsue or be sued in its own name. ” [ECF No. 85, ¶ 8]. FDOT Secretary Perdue “directs, \nadministers, coordinate s, and delegates the statutory duties of the FDOT.” Id. at ¶ 9.  \nAlpine , a Florida corporation , “operates a towing company and tow and storage \nyard  at 3500 NW 67 Street, Miami, FL 33147 (the ‘ Towing Yard’ ).” Id. at ¶ 10. “Alpine is \nnot a law enforcement age ncy with independent authority to enforce the law; however, \nit is authorized to tow vehicles parked on private properties under Fla. Stat. § 715.07, and Miami- Dade County Ordinance, Article III.” Id. Saravia is Alpine’s president and “ran \nthe day- to-day operations of Alpine for the relevant time period.” Id. at ¶ 11. \nThe SAC  further  alleges that:  \n8. . . . . SunPass is the FDOT Prepaid Toll Program.  \n*** \n18. SunPass , its employees, agents, or authorized representatives, with \ndeliberate indifference to the consequences, established and maintained a \npolicy, practice, or custom (the ‘SunPass Policy’) to share to [sic] towing companies alleged toll debts of vehicle owner s. \n19. The FDOT and [Secretary] Perdue know, or should have known that \npredatory towing companies like . . . Alpine [ ] use this information, and \nthrough intimidation, threats, and lies, including posing as law enforcement or executing acts of the exclusive  prerogative of law \n \n3 The facts summarized herein are included for context only and the Undersigned \nmakes no factual findings  in this Report and Recommendation s.

The shared information works as a wanted or hold orders  [sic] on \nvehicles with unpaid tolls . \n21. The FDOT has not developed a meaningful post- deprivation hearing \nor judicial remedy for an owner of a seized vehicle in the situation [sic] \nwhen it is seized as described herewith.  \n22. The FDOT is scienter [sic] that predatory towing companies are \nusing the alleged toll debt to defraud citizens by impounding and retaining their vehicles, but has not taken any preventative measures to stop this illegal practice, because it benefits from it.  \nId. at ¶ ¶ 8, 18–22 (emphasis added) . \nPlaintiff is the owner of a Mazda CX9 (the “Vehicle ”). Id. at ¶ 24. He “contracted \nwith SunPass to participate in its electronic toll payment program (the ‘Agreement’), \nwhich allows tolls to be collected from a SunPass account through an electronic \ntransponder.” Id. at ¶ 28. The Agreement required Plaintiff “to m aintain a prepaid \nbalance, and, at the moment he passed through a lane accepting the electronic payment, \nSunPass would automatically deduct the required toll charge from his account balance.” \nId. at ¶ 29. Plaintiff ’s transponder was defective and “FDOT knew or should have known \nof a defect in the transponder, but failed to properly notify Plaintiff.” Id. at ¶ 31. \nPlaintiff’s defective transponder “and/ or any other defect with the SunPass toll-\nby-plate system caused inaccurate charges to Plaintiff.”  Id. at ¶ 32. Specifically,  \n33. When the Vehicle went through toll facilities, instead of applying the \ntransponder fees, SunPass applied[ ] the toll- by-plate fees, which is almost \ndouble what is charged.  Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 4 of 455 34. Additionally, hundreds of toll- by-plate charges were ina ccurately \nassessed by the FDOT’s SunPass system when the Vehicle did not go \nthrough toll facilities.  \n35. Plaintiff was issued violations for failure to pay the toll fees.  \n36. As a result, Plaintiff is now being collected administrative charges, \npenalties, and fines in excess of what the individual toll would have cost.  \n37. To date, SunPass claims that Plaintiff owes over $4,000 (the ‘Debt’), \nconstituted [sic] a combination of purported unpaid tolls and associated \npenalties.  \nId. at ¶¶ 33 –37. Plaintiff contac ted SunPass Customer Service concerning the disputed \ndebt but has been unable to resolve the dispute. Id. at ¶¶ 38–41. \n On May 19, 2022, Plaintiff’s Vehicle was parked “right next to”  10902 NW 83 \nSt, Doral , Florida  33178. Id. at ¶ 43. At approximately 9:30 PM, Alpine towed the Vehicle \nto its Towing Yard. Id.  at ¶ 44. “No personal notice was given to Plaintiff about improper \nparking or towing, neither a warning notice was placed in the Vehicle before towing nor \nwas a parking ticket by a law enforcement officer.” Id. at ¶ 45. “Before impounding the \nVehicle, Alpine, employees, agents, or authorized representatives had never been in \ncontact with Plaintiff to discuss any of the described reasons to tow the Vehicle nor did it \nprovide  the proper documentation demonstrating the purported debt and Plaintiff’s \nobligation to pay it. ” Id. at ¶ 48. Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 5 of 456  Plaintiff and his family first approached a receptionist at the Towing Yard, \nattempting  to retrieve the Vehicle. Id. at ¶ 46.

Attacks on subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1) come in two forms: (1) “facial attacks” on the complaint, which require \nthe Court to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff to see if the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a basis for subject matter jurisdiction; and (2) “factual attacks,” \nwhich “challenge the existence of subject matter jurisdiction in fact” and require the \nCourt to consider matters outside the pleadings because no presumption  of truthfulness \nattaches to the plaintiff’s allegations.

Dunbar, 919 F.2d 1525, 1529 (11th Cir. \n1990) (internal citations omitted).  \n“ As a threshold procedural matter, a litigant must have standing to invoke the \njurisdiction of a federal court. ” Taylor v.

(citing Lujan v. \nDefenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 559–60 (1992)).  \nThe requirements needed to establish constitutional standing are straightforward: Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 7 of 458 (1) a plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact; (2) the injury must be causally \nconnected to the defendant’ s action; and (3) it must be likely that the injury will be \nredressed by a judgment in the plaintiff ’s favor.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), “a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual ma tter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.’” Ashcroft v.

To \nmeet this “plausibility standard,” a plaintiff must “plead[ ] factual content that allows the \ncourt to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct \nalleged.” Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556). The standard “does not require ‘detailed \nfactual allegations,’ but it demands more than an unadorned, the -defendant -unlawfully-\nharmed -me accusation.” Id.

But if \nallegations are indeed more conclusory than factual, then the court does not have to assume their truth. See Mamani v. Berzain , 654 F.3d 1148, 1153–54 (11th Cir. 2011). \nIII. Analysis  \nDefendants raise myriad reasons for the requested with -prejudice dismissal of the \nSAC. Plaintiff maintains that he has properly pled causes of action against all Defendants. \nThe parties’ arguments are addressed below.  \nA. 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Claims (Counts I, IV, V, and VI)  \n \n1. FDOT/Purdue  (Counts V  and VI) \n At the outset, Defendants argue that the Eleventh Amendment bars Plaintiff’s civil \nrights claims against FDOT/Perdue. [ECF No. 88, pp. 3 –4].\n5 They  also argue that Plaintiff’s \nclaims against Secretary Perdue in his official capacity are redundant and must be \n \n5 Defendants’ Eleventh Amendment Immunity argument concerns only monetary \ndamages  against FDOT/Perdue. Defendants raise additional grounds for the dismissal of \nCounts V and VI as to all  Defendants. Those arguments are addressed in a later section \nof this Report and Recommendations.  \n Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 9 of 4510 dismissed because Plaintiff has also sued FDOT. Id. at 4 (“It is a well -settled principle of \nlaw that when an officer is sued under § 1983 in his or her official capacity, the suit is \nsimply another way of pleading an action against an entity of which the officer is an \nagent .” (citing Busby v. City of Orlando , 931 F. 2d 764, 776 (11th Cir. 1991))).  \n Taveras  responds  that his injunctive and declaratory relief claims against \nFDOT/Perdue may proceed under  the Ex parte Young6 exception to the Eleventh \nAmendment.  [ECF No. 89, pp. 3 –4]. \n In their reply, Defendants underscore that Eleventh Amendment immunity is \nasserted by FDOT/Purdue “only as to Counts V and VI of the [ SAC ] seeking money  \ndamages .” [ECF No. 93, p. 8 (emphasis added)].7 They state that because “Plaintiff offered \nno argument  in his Response that Defendants FDOT and Perdue are not entitled to \nEleventh Amendment immunity as to Counts V and VI seeking money damages” and \nbecause “Plaintiff offered no argument in his Response that the official capacity claims \nagainst Secretary Perdue are subject to dismissal as being redundant and duplicative of \n \n6 Ex parte Young , 209 U.S. 123, 128, 28 S. Ct. 441, 444, 52 L . Ed. 714 (1908). \n \n7 In both Counts V and VI of the SAC, Plaintiff seeks to recover “a. [c]osts and \nreasonable attorney’s fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of Title 18, U.S.C., \nSection 241; b. [a]ctual damages; c. [s]tatutory damages; d. [p]u nitive damages; [and] e. \n[s]uch other relief as may be necessary, just, and proper.” [ECF No. 85, pp. 22–24 (wherefore clauses)].  \n Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 10 of 4511 the claims asserted against FDOT,” they are entitled to the with -prejudice8 dismissal of \nthose claims. Id.  \n Plaintiff does not address Defendants’ argument that the Eleventh Amendment \nbars section 1983 monetary  claims against FDOT/Purdue. Moreover, he fails to address \nDefendants’ argument that claims against Secretary  Perdue , in his official capacity, are \nredundant of claims against FDOT.  \n The failure to address an argument is grounds for deeming a claim abandoned. \nSee Altare v. Vertical Reality MFG, Inc. , No. 19- CV-21496, 2020 WL 209272, at *2 (S.D. Fla. \nJan. 14, 2020) ( on a motion to dismiss, stating that because “[the] [p]laintiff did not \nrespond to [the] argument . . ., consequently, the Court deem [ed] any response waived”); \nFive for Ent. S.A. v. Rodriguez , No. 11- 24142- CIV, 2013 WL 4433420, at *14 (S.D. Fla. Aug. \n15, 2013) (on cross -summary judgment motions, ruling that “[a] failure to a ddress issues \nin response to a motion is grounds for finding that the claims have been abandoned”).  \n Moreover, the law supports Defendants’ position . “[T]he Eleventh Amendment \nprohibits federal courts from entertaining suits by private parties against States and their \nagencies. . . . . There are two exceptions to this prohibition: where the state has waived its \nimmunity or where Congress has abrogated that immunity.” Selensky v. Ala. , 619 F. App’x \n \n8 An assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity attacks this Court’s subject matter \njurisdiction. Claims dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be without \nprejudice.

(dismissing claims against FDOT \nbecause FDOT was immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment) . \n “Florida has not consented or waived, and Congress has not abrogate d Eleventh \nAmendment immunity as to claims for money damages under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment or 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” Jasmin v.

Therefore, the Eleventh Amendment bars \nPlaintiff’s § 1983 monetary  claims against FDOT/Perdue.  \n Plaintiff’s Ex parte Young  argument does not refute Defendants’ contention that the \nEleventh Amendment bars claims for monetary  damages. See, e.g., Odebrecht Const., Inc. v. \nSec’y, Fla. Dep’t of Transp. , 715 F.3d 1268, 1289 (11th Cir. 2013) (addressing the irreparable \nharm prong for  obtaining a preliminary injunction and noting that “[ the movant] ha[d]  \nno monetary recourse  against a state agency like FDOT because of the Eleventh \nAmendment[,]” “[t]his includes damages claims against State officials in their official \ncapacity” and that “Ex Parte Young  suits like the one brought here have never been held \nto permit retrospective monetary damages ” (emphasis added) ). Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 12 of 4513  Lastly, Taveras sued both Secretary Purdue ( in his official capacity) and FDOT . \n[ECF No. 85]. “[W]hen a suit is filed against both a governmental entity and the entity’s \nofficers and employees in their official capacities, it is appropriate for the Court to dismiss \nthe named individual defendants in their official capacities as ‘redundant and possibly confusing to the jury.” Bailey v. Town of Lady Lake, Fla. , No. 5:05- CV464- OC10GRJ, 2006 \nWL 2048250, at *3 (M.D. Fla. July 20, 2006)  (quoting Busby v. City of Orlando , 931 F.2d 764, \n776 (11th Cir. 1991)).  The claims against Secretary Perdue, in his official capacity, are \nduplicative of Plaintiff’s claims against FDOT and should  be dismissed.  \n The Undersigned respectfully recommends that the District Court dismiss  \nSecretary Perdue from this lawsuit because Plaintiff’s claims against him are duplicative \nof his claims against FDOT and dismiss Plaintiff’s § 1983 claims (Counts V and VI) \nagainst FDOT to the extent Plaintiff seeks to recover monetary damages . \n2. Alpine/Sar avia  (Counts I and IV)  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiff’s section  1983 claims against Alpine/Saravia \n“should be  dismissed  inasmuch as [ ] Plaintiff alleges acts of a private or proprietary \nnature.” [ECF No. 88, p.  5 (noting that “‘[u]nder color of law’ with in the meaning of off \n[sic] 42 U.S.C. [§]  1983 refers to misuse of power possessed by virtue of state law and \nmade possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law and \nmay not include acts of a private or proprietary nature” ( citing Home Ins. Co. v. Leinart , \n698 S.W.2d 335 (Tenn. 1985)) ]. They state that “[i]t is not the role of a federal court under Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 13 of 4514 a federal civil rights statute to remedy violations of state law, if any, as alleged by this \nPlaintiff against Alpine and [ ] Sar avia to the extent that Alpine is authorized to tow \nvehicles parked on private properties.” Id. They also challenge Plaintiff’s standing to \nbring a section 1983 claim against these Defendants, based on the alleged lack of state action . Id. at 7. These arguments will be  addressed in turn.  \na. State action  \nDefendants contend that “[i]t is [ ] not enough for Plaintiff merely to allege that \nDefendants Alpine and [ ] Saravia acted under color of law without alleging that they \nacted jointly with the state o r its agents .” [ECF No. 88, p.  6 (emphasis added) ]. According \nto Defendants, it is not enough for Plaintiff “to allege that removal of vehicles is \ntraditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state, since Florida Statutes provide for \nremoval of vehicles from private property where no governmental agency or power is \nimplicated.” Id. at 7(citing Fla. Stat. § 715.07). Thus, Defendants argue that “Plaintiff’s \n1983 actions fail as to [Alpine/Saravia] for want of an allegation of joint action with a state agenc y.” Id. at 14. \nPlaintiff argues that he “has alleged and demonstrated that Alpine [ ] and [ ]. \nSaravia were indeed acting under color of state law” and notes (without citation to any paragraphs) that the SAC : (1) outlines instances where Alpine [ ] under t he direction of [ \n] Saravia  impounded and retained the Vehicle under allegations that are only the \nprerogative of a law enforcement unit” ; (2) “contains allegations that Alpine [ ] and [ ] Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 14 of 4515 Saravia were beneficiaries of state -granted privileges and powers  concerning vehicle \ntowing, which suggests a significant state involvement in their activities” ; and (3) \n“explicitly alleges that Alpine  [ ] and [ ] Saravia acted in concert with the \nFDOT/Sun[P]ass in towing and impounding [ ] Plaintiff ’s vehicle .” [ECF No. 89, pp. 4 –\n5 (emphasis added) ]. \nIn their reply, Defendants contend that “Plaintiff has failed to connect the dots and \nindicate how [ ]  Alpine Towing and [ ] Saravia’s [ ] actions in this case rise to the level of \nacting under color of state law .” [EC F No. 93, p.  3]. They maintain that “[s]imply \nindicating that they have previously impounded cars and have a contract to tow vehicles \nis not sufficient to indicate they were acting under color of state law in regard to their \nactions in this matter.”  Id. \nThe Undersigned agree s with Defendants that Plaintiff has failed to adequately \nallege that Alpine/Saravia acted under color of state law . “The ‘under -color -of-state -law \nelement of § 1983 excludes from its reach merely private conduct, no matter how \ndiscrim inatory or wrongful.’” Nelson v. Brieda, No. 3:22- CV-1265- HES -LLL, 2022 WL \n18232635, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 29, 2022), appeal dismissed, No. 22- 14294- J, 2023 WL \n2640014 (11th Cir. Mar. 3, 2023) (quoting American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan , 526 U.S. \n40, 50 (1999)).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit “employ[s] three distinct tests in determining whether the \nactions of a private entity are properly attributed to the state”: “‘(1) the public function Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 15 of 4516 test; (2) the state compulsion test; and (3) the nexus/joint action te st.’” Wilson v. Dollar -\nThrifty Auto Grp. -S. Fla Transp. , 286 F. App’x 640, 641 (11th Cir. 2008) (quoting Focus on \nthe Family v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth. , 344 F.3d 1263, 1277 (11th Cir. 2003)). \nThese tests are as follows:  \nThe public function test  limits state action to instances where private actors \nare performing functions traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the state. \nThe state compulsion test  limits state action to instances where the \ngovernment has coerced or at least significantly encouraged the action alleged to violate the Constitution. The nexus/joint action test  applies \nwhere the state has so far insinuated itself into a position of \ninterdependence with the [private party] that it was a joint participant in \nthe enterprise.  \nId. (emphasis  added).  “Only in rare circumstances can a private party be viewed as a \n‘state actor’ for section 1983 purposes.” Harvey v. Harvey, 949 F.2d 1127, 1130 (11th Cir. \n1992). \nPlaintiff’s first contention  is that Alpine , act ing under Saravia’s direction , \nimpounded and retained Plaintiff’s Vehicle. [ECF No. 89, p. 4]. Saravia is a private citizen, not a state actor. The SAC alleges that he is the “corporate president of Alpine who ran \nthe day- to-day operations of Alpine for the relevant time period.” [ECF No. 85, ¶ 11]. \nThere are no allegations that Saravia is an employee of any local, municipal, or state \ngovernment . \nThe fact that Saravia (a private citizen) directed Alpine to tow Plaintiff’s Vehicle \ndoes not establish state action.  “Action by a private party pursuant to [a] statute, without \nsomething more, [is] not sufficient to justify a characterization of that party as a state Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 16 of 4517 actor.” Phillips v. Life Prop. Mgmt. Servs., LLC , No. 21- 11350, 2021 WL 5444921, at *2 (11th \nCir. Nov.  22, 2021) (quoting Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co. , 457 U.S. 922, 939, 102 S. Ct. 2744, \n2754, 73 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1982)  (alterations in Phillips )); see also Hall v. Deas , No. 22- CV-62125-\nRAR, 2022 WL 17176847, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Nov. 23, 2022) (finding no state action where a \nprivate individual took it upon herself to falsely report to the police that the plaintiff was \ninvolved in a robbery and later committed perjury to further the prosecution).  \nPlaintiff’s second  contention  is that “Alpine [ ] and [ ] Sar avia were beneficiaries  \nof state -granted privileges and powers concerning vehicle towing” and that this fact \n“suggests a significant state involvement in their activities” [ ECF No. 89, p. 5  (emphasis \nadded) ]. The SAC alleges that “Alpine is not a law enforcement agency with independent \nauthority to enforce the law; however, it is authorized to tow vehicles parked on private \nproperties under Fla. Stat. § 715.07, and Miami -Dade County Ordinance, Article III .” \n[ECF No. 85, ¶ 10 (emphasis added)]. But the mere fact that a statute or ordinance  allows \na private entity to do something does not convert every private entity wh ich is exercising \nits right under that law  into a state actor . \nMoreover, it is simply not true that towing and impounding vehicles is exclusively \na public function. In Phillips v. Life Prop. Mgmt. Servs., LLC , the Eleventh Circuit \ndetermined that the trial court did not err in dismissing the plaintiff’s complaint for failure to state a claim under section 1983. No. 21 -11350, 2021 WL 5444921, at *2 (11th Cir. \nNov. 22, 2021). In that case, “[the plaintiff] allege[d] that Quick Drop,  a private company, Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 17 of 4541 the reasons  raised by Defendant for dismissing Count III. Plaintiff’s failure to address \nDefendants’ arguments is grounds for dismissing this count. See  De Lima v. Unites States, \nNo. 23 -60793- CIV, 2024 WL 762475, at *3 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 12, 2024) (“Based on [the] \n[p]la intiff’s failure to respond to [the] [d]efendants’ arguments that [the] [p]laintiff has \nnot sufficiently pled a claim for violation of the Fifth Amendment Due Process and Equal \nProtection clause, [the] [p]laintiff has indicated he does not oppose the motion to dismiss \n[c]ount 2 of his [c] omplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted.”) ; Saint -Cyr v. Walgreen Co. , No. 22- 11892, 2023 WL 6785074, at *2 (11th Cir. Oct. \n13, 2023) (“With respect to Saint -Cyr’s retaliation claim, the distr ict court did not err in \ndetermining that Saint- Cyr conceded that claim by failing to address Walgreens’ \nprotected activity and causal connection arguments in his response to the motion to \ndismiss.”) . \nAccordingly, the Undersigned respectfully recommends that the District Court \ndismiss Count III as to all Defendants.  \nE. With out Prejudice Dismissal  \nFor the reasons discussed above , the District Court should dismiss the SAC in its \nentirety.  Defendants argue that the dismissal of Plaintiff’s claims should be with \nprejudice.  They say that the SAC “is the sixth (6th) different version of [the] [c] omplaint \n \nwithin the permissible actions under the Ex parte Young  doctrine a nd the established \njurisprudence on declaratory judgments .” (emphasis added)].  Case 1:22-cv-23745-RNS   Document 103   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/15/2024   Page 41 of 4542 filed or submitted in this action.” [ECF No. 88, p. 18 (emphasis in original) ]. Defendants \nalso state that allowing Plaintiff to amend would be futile because “[a]ny further attempt \nby Plaintiff to file a further revised, amended pleading would still be properly dismissed \nor immediately subject to summary judgment for defendants” for the reason s stated in \nDefendant’s motion.  Id. \nPlaintiff’s response does not address Defendants’ request for a with -prejudice \ndismissal. H owever, h e does assert that Defendants’ motion lacks “substantive legal \nmerit” and suggest that it “may be an attempt to exploit [ ] Plaintiff ’s pro se status, causing \nfurther delays and expenses in the litigation process.” [ECF No. 89, p. 15]. Plaintiff is wrong on both  counts . Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12 specifically authorizes the filing \nof (and sets forth the timing for) motions to dismiss and, as evidenced by the \nUndersigned’s recommendations, Defendants’ motion has  substantive legal merit.  \n“[A] pro se plaintiff must generally be given one chance to amend his complaint ‘if \nit appears a more carefully drafted complaint might state a claim upon which relief can be granted even if the plaintiff never seeks leave to amend.’” Luecke v.

Moreover , “‘repeated failure to cure deficiencies by \namendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of \nallowance of amendment, . . . can justify dismissal with prejudice.” Carvel v.

He has already been given an \nopportunity to correc t pleading deficiencies.  Nonetheless, the Undersigned respectfully \nrecommends that the District Court dismiss the SAC without prejudice  and give Plaintiff \none (1) final  opportunity to correct his pleading deficiencies.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The U.S. District Court denied a motion by the government to forcibly administer antipsychotic medication to Edmond Charrette, who was charged with arson. The court found that the government did not meet its burden under the *Sell v. United States* decision to justify overriding Charrette’s constitutional rights to avoid unwanted medication. The case does not specifically involve AI, ML, or automated systems, but Charrette exhibited delusional thoughts about AI impersonating his communications.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the government can involuntarily administer antipsychotic medication to Edmond Charrette to restore his mental competency for trial against his will.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the government did not satisfy the necessary legal standard to forcibly medicate Charrette due to the lack of clear and convincing evidence of important governmental interests and uncertainties regarding his medical diagnoses and the efficacy and safety of treatment.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you don't want to take certain medicine because it makes you feel weird, and someone wants to force you to take it so you can go to court. The court decided that unless it's super important, no one can force you to take medicine if you don't want to, especially when it's unclear if the medicine will help or hurt. The court here said that the risks and unanswered questions mean they can't force Charrette to take the drugs.",

Criminal No. 22-40001 -MGM  \n \n \nORDER  RE: MOTION FOR INVOLUNTARY  \nADMINISTRATION OF ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION  \n \nJanuary 7, 2025  \nMASTROIANNI, U.S.D.J.  \nI. INTRODUCTION  \nThe government requests that the court issue an order  authorizing the Bureau of Prisons  \n(“BOP”)  to forcibly  administer antipsychotic medication to Edmond Charrette (“Defendant”)  in an \nattempt to restore his competency . Following a n evidentiary  hearing and oral argument , the court \nfinds that the government has not satisfied its formidable  burden under Sell v. United States , 539 U.S. \n166 (2003) , to override Defendant’s “‘significant’ constitutionally protected ‘liberty interest’ in \n‘avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs.’” Id. at 178 (quoting Washington v. \nHarper , 494 U.S. 210, 221 (1990)).  \nThe court also finds , in light of the denial of the forced -medication  request , there is not “a \nsubstantial probability that in the foreseeable future [Defendant]  will attain the capacity to permit the \nproceeding s to go forward .” 18 U.S.C. § 4241(d) . However, Defendant is  still “subject to the [civil \ncommitment] provisions of” 18 U.S.C. § 4246 . Id.; see also 18 U.S.C. § 4246(a).  A civil commitment \nproceeding  against Defendant  has already commenced in the Eastern District of North Carolina , Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 1 of 352 \n and this court expects that Defendant will be commit ted to the custody of the Attorney General for \nthe foreseeable future.  \nII. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDUR AL HISTORY  \nOn January 20, 2022 , Defendant was indicted on a charge of damage and destruction of a \nbuilding and personal property by means of fire in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 844(i) . (Dkt. No. 2.) The \ngovernment  alleges that on October 12, 2021, Defendant damaged and destroyed a restaurant, China \nCity, in Leominster, Massachusetts by setting it on fire. Security camera footage from a neighboring \nbusiness —admitted into evidence at both the detention hearing and the Sell hearing —shows  \nDefendant  drove to a strip mall plaza shortly before 3:00 a.m., exited the vehicle with a canister, \nbroke the restaurant’s window and entered with the canister, and then shortly thereafter jumped out \nof the same window on fire after a large explosion erupted from i nside the restaurant. ( Ex. A -6.)) \nAdditional security camera footage from inside the restaurant shows Defendant  pouring the \ncontents of the canister on the floor inside the kitchen area. ( Ex. A -5.) The Massachusetts State \nPolice discovered Defenda nt after he was admitted to  St. Vincent’s Hospital for burns that same \nday. (Dkt. No. 31 -1; Ex. A -18.) Defendant then transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital due \nto the extent of his injuries and was involuntarily hospitalized under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, § 12 \nfor ten days. (Dkt. No. 31 -1; Dkt. No. 140 at 4; Ex. A -18; Ex. C at 14 .)  \n Defendant originally retained as his attorney John L. Calcagni  III, but counsel filed a motion \nto withdraw on February 28, 2022, on the grounds that Defendant “discharged him.” (Dkt. No. 15.) \nMagistrate Judge David H. Hennessy granted the motion to withdraw on March 10, 2022, at which \ntime Defendant expressed his des ire to defend himself. (Dkt. No. 19.) Although Judge Hennessy \nsought to appoint Defendant a Federal Public Defender, he ultimately permitted Defendant to \nproceed pro se . (Id.) On March 23, 2022, Judge Hennessy held a detention hearing and ordered that \nDefe ndant be detained pending trial. (Dkt. No. 25.) At the detention hearing,  the government raised Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 2 of 353 \n a question about Defendant’s competency. (Dkt. No. 25.)  On May 3, 2022, the government filed a \nMotion for a Hearing to Determine Mental Competency of Defendant. (Dkt. No. 31.)  In support, \nthe government noted  that Defendant “appeared confused as to the nature of the proceedings” \nwhen the prosecutor attempted to conference with Defendant surrounding the detention hearing. \n(Id. at 2.) The government also pointed to Defendant’s history of mental health commitments and \nrefusals to sign medical waivers for Probation to monitor compliance with mental health treatment \nconditions of supervised release in United States v. Edmond Charrette , 21-cr-10188 -WGY,1 as well as \n“his behavior during the detention hearing.” ( Id.)  \nAfter a hearing, Judge Hennessy issued an Order for Competency Evaluation on June 2, \n2022, finding “there is reason to believe Defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease \nor defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is able to understand the nature \nand consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.” (Dkt. No. 43 \nat 1.) Judge Hennessy explained  that Defendant’s “courtroom behavior provides a reason to believe \nhe may not be competent,” as  he had “been disruptive during hearings” and “interrupted the court \nand counsel.” ( Id. at 2.) Judge Hennessy also explained that Defendant’s pro se  opposition to the \ngovernment’s motion to determine competency suggested he did not understand the nature of the \ncompetency proceedings, and he similarly appeared confused as to the nature of the detention \nhearing. ( Id.) Judge Hennessy further pointed to Probation’s report regarding a Pre -Sentenc e Report  \n(“PSR”) , prepared for Defendant’s 2018 sentencing in the Western District of Texas, which stated \nthat Defendant “ was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, insomnia and  antisocial disorder by military \ndoctors at Fort Hood and was committed to Darnall Army Medical  Center five times. ” (Id. at 3.)  In \n \n1 On June 15, 2021, jurisdiction over Defendant’s supervised release arising out of a conviction in the Western District \nof Texas transferred to this district and then was assigned to Judge William Young on July 19, 2021. United States v. \nEdmond Charrette , 21-cr-10188 -WYG (Dkt. Nos. 1, 4.) On November 18, 2021, Magistrate Judge Jennifer Boal issued an \nOrder detaining Defendant pending completion of a final hearing on revocation of supervised release in relation to the \nLeominster  arson incident. Id. (Dkt. No. 26).  Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 3 of 354 \n addition, Judge Hennessy considered the nature of the alleged criminal conduct in Massachusetts \nand the prior conduct in Texas ,2 both of which suggested Defendant may be incompetent.  \nAccordingly, Judge Hennessy ordered , pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 4241(b)  and 4247(b), that \nDefendant be committed to the custody of the Attorney General in order for a mental health \nprofessional to prepare a psychiatric report. ( Id. at 5-6.)  \nOn September 6, 2022, the undersigned3 appointed Sean Smith as Defendant’s attorney. \n(Dkt. No. 55.)  Later, on February 17, 2023, after Attorney Smith was unavailable for a status \nconference , the court appointed Thomas J. O’Connor as Defendant’s counsel.4 \nA. Dr. Rigsbee’s Competency Evaluation  \nOn October 18, 2022, the Acting Warden of FCI  Butner, where Defendant was placed for \nhis competency evaluation, submitted the competency report, completed by Forensic Psychologist \nJustin Rigsbee, Ph.D. (Dkt. No. 70.) Defendant refused to cooperate in the competency evaluation, \nand he would not consent  to the release of relevant mental health records.  Instead, Dr . Rigsbee  and \nstaff observed Defendant  and reviewed other  records, including the 2018 PSR as well as BOP and \nMarshals Service records. Dr. Rigsbee a lso consulted with the prosecutor, Defendant’s then -defense \nattorney (Sean Smith), and Defendant’s Probation officers. The competency report recounted \n \n2 In the Western District of Texas, Defendant pled guilty to filing a false statement during purchase of a firearm in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(a)(6) and 924(a)(2), filing a false statement in acquisition of a firearm in violation of 18 \nU.S.C. § 924(a)(1 )(A), and knowingly making false entry on application or record in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 5861(1).  \nJudge Alan Albright sentenced Defendant to 18 months incarceration and three years of supervised release.  Probation \nreported that Defendant “provided false information in connection with the purchase of approximately” 62 firearms \nover a five -week span. (Dkt. No. 31 -2 at 2.) Notably, regardless of the outcome of this criminal case, Defendant is \nprohibited from owning firearms because this court has found him mentally incompetent. See United States v. Fieste , 84 \nF.3d 713, 726 n.5 (7th Cir. 2023) (citing 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(4)).  \n \n3 On June 23, 2022, this case was reassigned from District Judge Timothy Hillman to the undersigned. (Dkt. No. 47.) \n \n4 Initially, the court appointed Attorney O’Connor as stand -by counsel, but at the March 20, 2023 competency hearing, \nthe court found Defendant was not capable of representing himself and appointed Attorney O’Connor as Defendant’s \nattorney. Defendant, howeve r, has consistently refused, despite repeated attempts from both the court and his counsel, \nto communicate with or even acknowledge Attorney O’Connor. The court notes that Attorney O’Connor nevertheless \nzealously represented Defendant’s interests throughout these proceedings.  Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 4 of 355 \n Defendant’s background , including that he was married in Nicaragua in 2011 and has two sons, and \nhe had enlisted in the United States Army between 2011 and 2015. According to the 2018 PSR, \nDefendant was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, insomnia, and antisocial disorder by military \ndoctors at Fo rt Hood in Texas in 2015; he was prescribed Celexa, Ambien, and Trazodone; and he \nhad been committed to Darnall Behavior Therapy Health Hospital on five separate occasions.  \nFollowing Defendant’s arrest in 2018, during an interview with a psychologist at a BOP intake \nscreening, Defendant reported that he had five hospitalizations in 2015 “all because of suicidal and \nhomicidal ideation” and that he had considered “suicide bombing or shooting” and had attempted \nto hang himself in that same year. ( Id. at 6.)  \nBOP records from 2018 and 2019 show various disciplinary infractions while Defendant was \nincarcerated  at FMC Devens , including for urinating in his cell, refusing to obey orders, and \ninterfering with security devices. Defendant was placed on suicide watch precautions on two \noccasions and often refused to engage with prison staff  for extended periods of time. Defendant \nalso exhibited strange behavior and made concerning comments, including nudity, spreading feces \naround his cell, stating that his food was po isoned, and writing the word “radiation” on his cell wall \nand scratching the word “PACE” on his forehead . (Id. at 6-10.) Defendant reportedly claimed he \nhad an implant in his chest, and on another occasion stated , “his most recent telephone calls with his \nwife were actually with artificial intelligence, only to later say that the BOP had used records of his \nphone calls with his wife to fabricate his recent phone calls.” ( Id. at 9-10.) In 2019,  while \nincarcerated at FMC  Devens,  Defendant was assigned a diagn osis of antisocial personality disorder .  \nIn September of 2022, after Defendant arrived at FCI  Butner for his competency evaluation, \nhe refused to answer any intake questions and generally declined to engage with Dr. Rigsbee, despite \nmultiple attempts. Defendant did interact with correctional staff, but he refused to stop covering his \ncell’s window and security cameras and received discip linary infractions. Dr. Rigsbee also noted that Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 5 of 356 \n Defendant refused to speak with his recently appointed counsel  (Sean Smith) , abruptly hanging up \nthe phone on him “upon being informed of whom he would be speaking with at the time.” ( Id. at \n16.) However, Dr. Rigsbee reported that “there was no evidence of psychotic symptoms during the \nevaluation period,” and Defendant “did not appear to be responding to internal stimuli, nor did he \nverbalize delusional thought content.” ( Id. at 13.) Dr. Rigsbee also opined that Defendant “did not \ndisplay clinical symptomat ology consistent with a severe mental illness (i.e., psychosis) during the \ncurrent evaluation period,” and “[t]here were no observed or otherwise noted instances of \ndisorganized speech/thought, auditory and/or visual hallucinations, negative symptoms (i.e., \nanhedonia), or disorganized or catatonic behavior.” ( Id. at 15.) Dr. Rigsbee assigned Defendant a \ndiagnos is of other specified personality disorder, with antisocial features , but this was due to the \nabsence of evidence of “conduct disorder ” prior to the age of 15, which is required for a formal \ndiagnosis of antisocial personality disorder . Nevertheless, Dr. Rigsbee explained that Defendant \n“otherwise exhibits diagnostic features of Antisocial Personality Disorder,” such as “a failure to \nconform to social norms with respect to lawful behavior” and “a tendency to behave impulsively \ngiven his  decisions to act out in a fashion that does not take into account his own best interests .” (Id. \nat 14 -15.) While acknowledging the limitations of his evaluation (given Defendant’s refusal to \nparticipate), Dr. Rigsbee ultimately opined that Defendant was competent to proceed to trial.  \nB. Competency Hearing and Transportation Issues  \n The court, for its part,  has had its own difficulty arranging for the transportation and/or \nappearance of Defendant for court proceedings. After receiving Dr. Rigsbee’s competency report, \nthe court held a status conference on November 15, 2022, but the Clerk’s Office received \nnotification from the Wyatt Detention Facility, where Defendant had been transferred, that he \nrefused to attend the remote video conference. (Dkt. No. 57.) On December 19, 2022, the court had \nscheduled a status conference for the Springfield courthouse, but it was informed that Defendant Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 6 of 357 \n refused to physically leave the detention facility to attend the court hearing, so the court converted \nthe status to a Zoom hearing which Defendant refused to  participate in. (Dkt. Nos. 59, 61, and 65.) \nOn February 2, 2023, the court held a status conference in the Worcester courthouse, and it was \nagain informed that Defendant refused to physically leave the detention facility to attend the hearing.  \n(Dkt. No. 71.) On February 3, 2023, as discussed at the prior  status conferences, the court issued the \nfirst of many sealed orders authorizing minimal use of force against Defendant in order to \naccomplish the transportation of Defendant to the court for hearings. (Dkt. No. 72; see also Dkt. \nNos. 83, 152, 163.) The court understands that despite the authorization to use some amount of \nforce, if necessary, against Defendant, Marshals Service and BOP personnel generally have not had \nto do so, as the mere threat of force (coupled with court authorization) has sufficed to compel \nDefendant’s compliance or mere passive r esistance.  \n  On February 15, 2023, the court held a status conference in the Springfield courthouse. \n(Dkt. No. 73.)  Defendant refused to sit at the counsel table until Attorney O’Connor moved and sat \nin the audience -section of the court; later , Defendant sat on the floor. Defendant briefly engaged \nwith the court but fixated on his belief that he had already pled guilty before Judge Hennessy and \nwas in the sentencing phase.  \nOn March 20, 2023 , the court held a competency hearing for the purpose of assessing \nDefendant’s competency “to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against \nhim [and] to assist properly in his defense.” 18 U.S.C. § 4241(d). At the hearing, the court engaged in \nan extended colloquy with Defendant re garding his understanding of the status of his criminal case.  \nAgain, Defendant displayed an irrational fixation on his belief that he previously pled guilty before \nJudge Hennessy, despite repea ted explanations from the court to accept that no such guilty plea had \noccurred and that the court needed to assess Defendant’s competency before he could proceed to \nthe next stage of this case.  Defendant also displayed peculiarities in his affect, demeanor, and speech Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 7 of 358 \n patterns at the competency hearing , as well as an inability to focus on the matter at hand. The court \nadditionally  heard testimony from Dr. Rigsbee , who had the opportunity to observe Defendant’s \nextended colloquy with the court.  However, as noted in the court’s Order Re: Competency, “ Dr. \nRigsbee’s opinion did not appear to be significantly influenced by Defendant’s behavior at the \nhearing, which Dr. Rigsbee believed was rigid, but not delusional. ” (Dkt. No. 86 at 4.)  \nThe court, in its March 22, 2023 Order Re: Competency,  rejected Dr. Rigsbee’s assessment \nand found  “Defendant’s behavior and thinking went well beyond rigid and appeared at least semi -\ndelusional. ” (Id.) The court also found  “that Dr. Rigsbee’s failure to analyze and account for the \nextreme behavior Defendant displayed at the competency hearing and adjust or explain his opinions \nin any meaningful way significantly undermines Dr. Rigsbee’s reliability ,” and  the court  gave “no  \ncredit to Dr. Rigsbee’s methodolo gy or conclusion that Defendant is competent. ” (Id. at 4-5.) The \ncourt ultimately found  that Defendant was “ suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him \nmentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of \nthe proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense. ” (Id. at 1 (citing 18 U.S.C. § \n4241(d) ).) The court therefore committed Defendant to the custody of the Attorney General, under \n18 U.S.C. § 4241(d)(1),  for the  purpose of determining w hether there is a substantial probability that \nin the foreseeable future he  will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go forward . \n On December 15, 2023, after multiple status report updates from the government explaining \nthat Defendant was on a waitlist for placement in a suitable facility, the court issued an order \nauthorizing minimal force to screen Defendant for tuberculosis  (which he had been resisting)  and \ntransport him to FMC Butner, so that Defendant would not lose his long -awaited spot for \nrestoration treatment. (Dkt. No. 116.)5 Defendant arrived at FMC Butner on January 2, 2024 . \n \n5 The court also issued orders authorizing the disclosure of Defendant’s medical and mental health records to FMC \nButner medical professionals. (Dkt. Nos. 124, 125.)  Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 8 of 359 \n C. Dr. Sharf’s Competency Evaluation  \n On April 30, 2024, the Warden of FMC Butner submitted a forensic evaluation completed \nby Forensic Psychologist Allyson Sharf, Ph.D. (Dkt. No. 133.)  Dr. Sharf recounted the background \ninformation contained in Dr. Rigsbee’s report, largely drawn from the 2018 PSR and BOP and \nMarshals Service records . However, Dr. Sharf also had access to additional records which were not \navailable to Dr. Rigsbee, including court transcripts and medical records  from Massachusetts \nGeneral Hospital, St. Vincent Hospital, and th e Carl. R. Darnall Army Medical Center.  Dr. Sharf \nreviewed those medical records, starting with records from the Darnall Army Medical Center from \n2015, which show Defendant obtained outpatient and inpatient mental health services between 2014 \nand 2015. ( Id. at 11 ; Ex. D.)  Dr. Sharf explained that Defendant  \nwas diagnosed with a variety of mental health disorders, though such diagnoses were \ntypically related to mood symptoms (e.g., adjustment disorder with anxiety and \ndepressed mood, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, adjustment disorder with \ndisturbance of emotions and cond uct, adjustment disorder with mixed emotional \nfeatures, depression, mood disorder in conditions classified elsewhere, “highly \nirritable”), personality pathology (e.g., “cluster B personality disorder”), or substance \nuse (e.g., alcohol abuse).  \n \n(Dkt. No. 133 at 11.) Defendant “was routinely prescribed Celexa ‘for anxiety depression’ and \nTrazadone ‘for insomnia,’ though prescriptions for haloperidol and lorazepam were also noted.” \n(Id.) Moreover, Defendant was psychiatrically hospitalized on four occasions during this time period \nfor suicidal and/or homicidal ideation. Specifically, Dr. Sharf noted:  \nHe was discharged on 11/06/14, after a hospitalization for “homicidal thoughts.” He \nwas hospitalized again on 04/07/15 for “suicidal ideation” with a plan. It was noted \nhe was experiencing increased life stressors at that time (e.g., “not being recommended \nto become a pilot, Article 15 for disrespect” and a significant argument with his wife). \n[Defendant] was then hospitalized from 06/23/15 to 06/30/15 for “worsening \ndepression and possible hanging attempt.” Finally, he was hospitalized on 07/10/15 \nfor “HI [homicidal ideation] with a plan. Again, increased life stressors (e.g., pending \nchapter separation from the army) were noted.  \n \n(Id. at 11 -12.)  Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 9 of 3510 \n  Dr. Sharf then reviewed the medical records from St. Vincent Hospital and Massachusetts \nGeneral Hospital. The St. Vincent Hospital records indicated Defendant arrived at the hospital on \nOctober 12, 2021 with burns on his body and he “present[ed] with agit ation ” and  “strange behavior \nas witnessed by bystanders or family,” including that he was observed “running around upstairs \nagitated ” and had to be brought to the emergency department by security. ( Id. at 12; Ex. C at 21.) St. \nVincent Hospital records also  noted Defendant had an altered mental status, appearing “delirious,” \nwith “manic” affect and that “delusions/hallucinations are present.” (Dkt. No. 133 at 12; Ex. C at \n29.) Dr. Sharf noted that an involuntary psychiatric evaluation  under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, § 12  \nwas initiated and Defendant was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital’s burn unit. \nDefendant’s “diagnoses were listed as: burn of second degree of foot, burn of second degree of back \nof right hand, burn of second degree of abdominal wall, unspecifi ed psychosis not due to a \nsubstance or known physiological condition.” (Dkt. No. 133 at 12.)  \nAt Massachusetts General Hospital, Defendant was hospitalized from October 12, 2 021 to \nOctober 22, 2021. “Upon arrival , [Defendant] was noted to evidence slow speech and flat affect”; he \nwas also “described as guarded about the precipitating incident and vague when answering \nquestions.” ( Id.) In addition, Defendant “initially refused to interact with psychology or psychiatry \nstaff” and did not permit them to contact his wife. ( Id.) However, hospital admission records note:  \nWife reports that patient has been hospitalized psychiatrically as recently as June 2021. \nHe had been under a lot of stress and was acting inappropriately, laughing at \ninappropriate things, spacing out and talking to himself and not sleeping. The wife \nreports that the patient started acting like this 2 days ago.  \n \n(Id.; Ex. B.) Dr. Sharf note d that “a diagnostic impression of ‘brief psychotic disorder’ was noted in \nthe records from 07/20/21, though no additional details of the hospitalization were described in the \navailable records.” (Dkt. No. 133 at 12.)6 Eventually, Defendant permitted hospital staff to contact \n \n6 Dr. Sharf did explain that “St. Vincent Hospital records indicated [Defendant] presented to the hospital on 06/29/21,” \nbut it was for a complaint of a headache after Defendant received a COVID vaccination the previous day and Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 10 of 3511 \n his wife, who denied her previous statements about Defendant’s odd behaviors and expressed no \nsafety concerns. The section 12 involuntary hospitalization was then discontinued and Defendant \nwas released.  \n Dr. Sharf then discussed Defendant’s presentation and behavior after arriving at FMC \nButner on January 2, 2024. She explained that Defendant “presented as uncooperative with the \nforensic intake,” and “[h]e was observed pacing in the secured cell in R&D (h e was reportedly \nuncooperative with the US Marshals during the flight).” ( Id. at 13.) When Dr. Sharf first met \nDefendant, “he looked past [her] and did not make eye contact. He was observed muttering \nsomething under his breath, though it was not clear what  was being said, and blinking forcefully.” \n(Id.) Ultimately, “[a]ttempts to engage him in the forensic intake were unsuccessful.” ( Id.) Dr. Sharf \nexplained that Defendant  \npresented similarly throughout the duration of the evaluation period. That is, he \ntypically refused to acknowledge or speak with psychology or psychiatry staff. He was \ngenerally observed either pacing his assigned cell without making eye contact or resting  \non his bed underneath the blankets. He was not receptive to staff attempts to engage \nhim, including knocking loudly on the door, calling his name, or asking him questions.  \n \n(Id.) In addition, Defendant “declined to participate in mental health treatment throughout his \nhospitalization” and “did not respond to staff’s request to participate in an interview or consider \ntaking psychotropic medication.” ( Id.) Although Defendant did attend the first three sessions of his \ncompetency restoration group, “he was generally not attentive or engaged during group sessions” \nand “only verbally spoke when it was time for him to be escorted back to his cell or to make \nrequests (e.g., asked for a jacket with a working zippe r, asked for a shower).” ( Id.) Moreover, \nDefendant “did interact briefly with other staff over the course of the evaluation period,” for \nexample, asking “about obtaining additional food or moving to an open population.” ( Id. at 1 4.) But \n \nDefendant was discharged that same day. ( Id.)  Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 11 of 3512 \n when Dr. Sharf “attempted to speak with [Defendant] about these concerns, he did not engage.” \n(Id.) \n Based on the available information, Dr. Sharf assigned Defendant the  following diagnoses: \nunspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorder; and other specifi ed personality \ndisorder, antisocial features.  (Id.) Dr. Sharf explained:  \nPsychotic disorders are defined by abnormalities in one or more of the following five \ndomains: delusions (fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light of conflicting \nevidence); hallucinations (perception -like experiences that occur without an ext ernal \nstimulus); disorganized thinking (speech); grossly disorganized or abnormal motor \nbehavior (including catatonia); and negative symptoms (such as diminished emotional \nexpression and avolition).  \n \n(Id.) In this regard, she noted that “[r]ecords indicate [Defendant] has presented with symptoms that \ncould be indicative of a psychotic disorder,” including that Defendant “evidenced bizarre behavior, \nappeared distractible, related oddly, demonstrated flat af fect, and displayed oddities in his speech.” \n(Id.) Dr. Sharf continued: “Despite the presence of rigid thinking and odd behavior, [Defendant] \ndoes not appear to meet the full criteria for schizophrenia, as there is limited information regarding \nwhether  or not he has experienced hallucinations and/or delusions.” ( Id. at 15.) Dr. Sharf also \nacknowledged “it is difficult to discern the severity of his current psychotic symptoms to obtain a \nfull understanding of current thought process,” because of Defendant’s “unwillingness to participate \nin interviews to obtain more in formation.” ( Id.) Accordingly, Dr. Sharf opined that a diagnosis of \nunspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder “is most appropriate” “at this \ntime,” since “[t]his categor y applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a \nschizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder that cause clinically significant distress or \nimpairment in social, occupations, or other important areas of functioning predominate ” but still \n“do not meet the full criteria for any of  the disorders in the schizophrenia spectrum and other \npsychotic disorders diagnostic class.” ( Id.)  Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 12 of 3513 \n  Dr. Sharf  then explained that Defendant’s “history is also consistent with other personality \ndisorder, specifically antisocial features.” ( Id.) She noted that  \nantisocial personality disorder is categorized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for, \nand violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and \ncontinues into adulthood. Diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disord er also \nincludes a failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviors. \nIndividuals with antisocial personality disorder are frequently deceitful and \nmanipulative in order to gain personal profit or pleasure. They may repeatedly lie, use \nan alias, con others, or malinger . A pattern of impulsivity may be manifested by spur \nof the moment decision -making, without forethought and without consideration for \nthe consequences to self or others. They tend to be irritable and aggressive and may \nrepeatedly get into physical fights o r commit acts of physical assaults.  \n \n(Id.) Dr. Sharf opined that “[c]ollateral records suggest a history of aggressive and assaultive behavior \n(e.g., hospitalizations related to homicidal ideation), deceitfulness (e.g., receiving incident reports for \nlying or falsifying statements), impulsivity, and irresponsibility.” ( Id.) As noted by Dr. Rigsbee, \nhowever, a full diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder requires the existence of “conduct \ndisorder” prior to the age of 15, and, “[g]iven the dearth of information provided by [Defendant] \nand the only available records being limited to adulthood,” little is known about his pattern of \nbehavior as a child or in adolescence. ( Id. at 15 -16.) \n As to competency, Dr. Sharf opined that “there is no evidence to suggest [Defendant’s] \nfactual understanding of courtroom proceedings is impaired”  and noted his prior experience with \ncourt proceedings.  (Id. at 16.) However, she questioned “his rational understanding of the charges \nagainst him and his ability to assist and work with a defense attorney.” ( Id.) Dr. Sharf explained that \nDefendant “has previously demonstrated a lack of understanding regarding the status of his case \n(e.g., repeatedly asserting h e has already pleaded guilty),” and “[h]e also perseverated on seemingly \nirrelevant information (e.g., his desire to obtain a divorce) during the prior court hearing.” ( Id.) \n“Most concerning,” Dr. Sharf explained, was that Defendant “was not receptive to attempts to \neducate him about these issues,” “[d]espite being gently challenged on his beliefs and being provided \neducation by the Court on multiple occasions.” ( Id.) “Such rigid and inflexible thinking will likely Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 13 of 3514 \n make it difficult to rationally participate in court proceedings and work towards his defense.” ( Id.) \nDr. Sharf also noted that Defendant’s “o dd behavior” during the evaluation period “was particularly \nconcerning,” as he “was typically observed pacing aimlessly back and forth in his assigned cell with a \nblank stare on his face.” ( Id.) Moreover, Defendant “did not appear to engage in goal -directed \nbehavior throughout the evaluation period.” ( Id.) “For example, he would periodically ask custody \nstaff if he co uld move to open population,” but when Dr. Sharf “would attempt to speak with him \nfurther about this in order to grant his request, he would not respond.” ( Id.) Ultimately, Dr. Sharf \nopined that Defendant “is currently suffering from a mental disease or defect, which renders him \nnot competent to stand trial.” ( Id.) \n However, Dr. Sharf stated her “opinion, in consultation with the treatment team, that a \nsubstantial probability exists that [Defendant’s] competency to stand trial can be restored with \nappropriate treatment with antipsychotic medicine.” ( Id. at 17.) She explained that “less intrusive \nmethods of treatment, such as psychotherapy, are not likely to restore his competency.” ( Id.) Since \nDefendant “has refused to accept recommend ed medication treatment on a voluntary basis,” Dr. \nSharf requested “the court order treatment with psychotropic medication on an involuntary basis” \nand offered to “submit an Addendum to the Forensic Evaluation which will outline in detail our \nproposed treatment plan and further details pertinent to the” factors under Sell v. United States , 539 \nU.S. 169 (2003).7 \nD. The Government’s Sell Request  \nOn May 16, 2024, the government filed a motion requesting an order for an addendum to  \n \n7 Dr. Sharf  also addressed the possibility of involuntary medication under the standard articulated in Washington v. Harper , \n494 U.S. 210 , 227  (1990)  (holding that “ the Due Process Clause permits the State to treat a prison inmate who has a \nserious mental illness with antipsychotic drugs against his will, if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the \ntreatment is in the inmate ’s medical interest .”). She explained that Defendant “has been free from aggressive or self -\ndestructive behavior since his arrival at FMC Butner,” and “[h]e has not engaged in behavior which would pose a high \nrisk of danger to himself or others” in that setting. ( Id.) Therefore, Dr. Sharf and the treatment team opined that \nDefendant “does not meet Harper  criteria for involuntary treatment insofar as he is not gravely disabled nor does he \npresent an imminent risk of danger to himself or other in the hospital setting.” ( Id.) Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 14 of 3515 \n the Forensic Evaluation to address the Sell factors and outline a proposed treatment plan. (Dkt. No. \n135.) The court held a status conference the following day and allowed the government’s motion. \n(Dkt. No. 136.)  \nOn July 2, 2024, FMC Butner submitted a Forensic Addendum completed by C harles A. \nCloutier, M.D., a Staff Psychiatrist, in response to the court’s order. (Dkt. No. 140.) Dr. Cloutier’s \nreport listed Defendant’s diagnosis as unspecified schizophrenia and other psychotic disorder. ( Id. at \n1.) He reported that Defendant “remains mute and withdrawn and does not appear to have any \ninsight into his mental illness.” ( Id.) Although Defendant “has refused to come out of his cell to \nmeet with care providers or attend  recreation, he has maintained basic hygiene and has continued to \neat and maintain hydration.” ( Id.) Dr. Cloutier opined that Defendant’s “mutism and refusal to make \neye contact or speak with staff suggests possible catatonia in context of a severe psychotic illness,” \nand that “[c]urrently, [Defendant] is not able to rationally accept or decline psychiat ric treatment.” \n(Id.) Dr. Cloutier reported that Defendant “has not attended any psychoeducational groups.” ( Id.) \nHowever, “[a]lmost  daily, he asks the unit officers for an extra food tray and/or to be moved to \nopen population.” ( Id.) But “the officers note that he makes little if any eye contact, speaks in an odd \nmanner, and consistently refuses to leave his cell.” ( Id.) Dr. Cloutier next reviewed the background \ninformation recounted in Dr. Rigsbee’s and Dr. Sharf’s reports. He also noted that “[r]ecords from \nSt. Vincent Hospital, MGH, and Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center show [Defendant] was given \ndroperidol (for agi tation) or halo peridol for apparent psychosis or ‘as needed’ for agitation (both are \nantipsychotic medications).” ( Id. at 4.) However, “[t]here are no available records showing long term \ntreatment with an antipsychotic medication.” ( Id.) \n Dr. Cloutier proposed that Defendant be treated with haloperidol (Haldol), reasoning that \nDefendant “has a mental illness that is very likely to respond to antipsychotic medication .” (Id.) \nSpecifically, “[a] diagnosis of unspecified  schizophrenia places him in a population of patients with Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 15 of 3516 \n psychosis that can attain competency 70 -80% of the time with antipsychotic medication.” ( Id.) Dr. \nCloutier noted his proposal “is the recommended first line of treatment for schizophrenia according \nto the Clinical Practice Guidelines of the American Psychiatric Association,” and “[t]here is no \nevidence to support psychotherapy alone being able to  treat schizophrenia.” ( Id.) Dr. Cloutier cited a \n2013 study8 which reviewed the treatment outcomes  of 132 defendants with various psychotic \ndisorders  who were  involuntarily medicated  with antipsychotic medication , under Sell, between June \nof 2003 and December  of 2009, “with the majority (79%) improving sufficiently to be restored to \ncompetency status.” ( Id. at 5.) In particular, “[i]n defendants diagnosed with schizophrenia, 62 of 81 \n. . . (approximately 76%) were restored to competency status”; in defendants “diagnosed with \nschizoaffective disorder, 18 of 22 (81.8%) were restored to competency status”; and “[i]n defendants \nwith a diagnosis of psychosis  not otherwise specified . . . , 13 of 14 (92.9%) were restored to \ncompetency.” ( Id.)9  \nDr. Cloutier acknowledged that “it is best to recommend medication which the patient has \nresponded well to and tolerated in the past,” but “there are no records available of any extended \ntreatment with antipsychotic medication.” ( Id.) Moreover, Defendant’s “poor insight into his mental \nillness, the number of years untreated, and sparse treatment history, all limit his chances of \nresponding to antipsychotic medication.” ( Id.) However, Dr. Cloutier noted “positive prognostic \nfactors include [Defendant’s] age and recently some evidence of responding to haloperidol.”  (Id.) Dr. \nCloutier explained that for patients with schizophrenia, “it is recommended to start with a s econd -\ngeneration antipsychotic medication such as risperidone (Risperdal) due to their relatively lower risk \n \n8 Robert E. Cochrane et al., The Sell Effect: Involuntary Medication Treatment is a “Clear and Convincing” Success,  Law and \nHuman Behavior (2013) . \n \n9 Dr. Cloutier testified at the Sell hearing that psychosis not otherwise specified “would have included,”  \n at the time the Cochrane  study was released, “the unspecified schizophrenia disorder and other psychotic  disorders ” \nwhich Defendant has been diagnosed with. (Dkt. No. 164 at 108.)  Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 16 of 3517 \n of side effects.” ( Id.) But because of Defendant’s “lack of insight into his mental illness, [he] will \nrequire involuntary medication by intramuscular injection,” and therefore, Dr. Cloutier \nrecommended haloperidol, which is available in both short -acting and long -acting inject able \nformulations. ( Id.) He explained that haloperidol “is an antipsychotic which is a class of psychiatric \nmedication widely used in the treatment of psychosis in a variety of clinical settings including \nhospital emergency department s, psychiatric hospitals and outpatient mental health clinics,” and \n“has been widely used in various clinical settings for decades and is often utilized in patients who do \nnot respond to newer agents or have severe symptoms.” ( Id.) Dr. Cloutier proposed starting \nDefendant “on intramuscular injection of immediate/short acting haloperidol lactate at 3mg to see \nhow he responds,” and “[i]f it is tolerated without allergic reaction, then he [would] be given \nintramuscular injection of lo nger-acting haloperidol de canoate starting at a low do se of 50mg every 4 \nweeks with target dos e range of 50 -to-100mg every 2 -to-4 weeks.” ( Id.)  \nDr. Cloutier further explained that “[t]he benzodiazepine, lorazepam, might also be \nnecessary to treat symptoms of possible catatonia,” which “is a behavior syndrome that can occur in \npatients who are ill with an underlying psychiatric disorder such as a s evere mood or psychotic \ndisorder.” ( Id.) Dr. Cloutier opined that “some signs of mild catatonia appear evident, including his \nmutism and odd behavior; however, since he is getting up and walking around his cell daily and he is \nmaintaining adequate intake o f food, this behavior may be primarily due to his untreated psychosis.” \n(Id.) He then state d: “If lorazepam is used in this context, it is given . . . by intramuscular injection at \n2mg two to three times a day.” ( Id.) \nNext, Dr. Cloutier explained that “[a]s symptoms decrease and compliance and insight \nimprove, then oral formulations  of antipsychotic medication, including those with lower side -effects, \ncan be consider ed, starting with risperidone,” the second -generation medication. ( Id. at 6.) “Other \npossible medications include aripiprazole and paliperidone, both of which are available in oral and Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 17 of 3531 \n significant likelihood that Defendant will remain in custody for the foreseeable future undermines \n(but does not completely overcome) the government’s and the victim’s primary interest in safety.  \n Second, Defendant’s significant period of pretrial confinement also reduces  the \ngovernmental interest in the prosecution here. Although courts generally “use the statutory \nmaximum sentence in determining whether the government has an important interest in prosecuting \na defendant,” most courts look to the actual length of a likely sentence when determining whether a \nsignificant period of pretrial confinement presents “special circumstances” that weaken the \ngovernment’s interest in the prosecution . Berry, 911 F.3d at 363; see Grigsby , 712 F.3d at 972 -73 \n(“[W]e must also examine whether the length of Grisby’s confinement while the government \nattempts to restore his competency and prosecute him may approximate the length of any sentence \nof imprisonment he ultimately may receive if convi cted. . . . This analysis required by the Supreme \nCourt is entirely separate and distinct from determining at the outset whether the statutory \nmaximum penalty for the crime objectively establishes the seriousness of the crime and the \ngovernment’s interest in prosecuting it, which is not in dispute here.” (citation omitted)). The parties \nagree that Defendant has been in custody since November of 2021 —over 37 months at this point. \nDr. Cloutier testified it would likely take between four and eight months for the antipsychotic \nmedication to restore Defendant’s competence. The court finds, in light of Defendant’s medical \nhistory, that it would take closer to eight months to fully restore Defendant’s competency to the \npoint where he could  adequately understand and participate in criminal proceedings, assuming the \nmedication is effective. A trial or guilty plea and then sentencing would likely take at least another \ntwo months, bringing Defendant’s likely pre -sentencing confinement to at least  47 months.19 If \nconvicted, Defendant would be facing a 60 -month mandatory minimum sentence. Thus, even under \n \n19 In addition, Defendant could and (through counsel) likely would exercise his right to an interlocutory appeal, which \nwould add significantly more time to the court’s estimates. See White , 620 F.3d at 414 & n.11; Ryan, 411 F. Supp. 3d at \n583. Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 31 of 3532 \n an optimistic timeframe, Defendant would have already served the vast majority of the minimum \nmandatory portion of a sentence this court ultimately imposes upon conviction. Defendant clearly \ncould be sentenced longer, but he would receive credit for a “significant” portion of any sentence \nultimately imposed , thus  weaken ing the government’s interest in this prosecution.20 Sell, 539 U.S. at \n180.  \nIn light of these special circumstances, the court finds the government has not \ndemonstrated, by clear and convincing evidence, that important governmental interests are at stake \nin this prosecution to such an extent as to outweigh Defendant’s liberty inte rest in resisting forcible \nantipsychotic medication.  \nAs to the other three Sell prongs, which address the medical efficacy of the proposed \ntreatment, the court finds there is too much ambiguity as to Defendant’s diagnoses and which \ncondition or conditions are the cause of his competency -related issues.21 Dr. Rigsbee diagnosed \nDefendant with other specified personality disorder, with antisocial features . Dr. Sharf agreed with \nthis diagnosis but also provided an additional diagnosis of unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or \nother psychotic disorder . However, Dr. Sharf testified that “it’s important, for purposes of \ndetermining whether or not to force somebody to take medication, to be certain as to which of \nthose two disorders [Defendant] suffers from,” and that she could not rule out that Defendant’s \nbehavior at the  Sell hearing was caused by antisocial personality disorder, rather than a psychotic \ndisorder. ( Dkt. No. 164  at 25.)  Dr. Cloutier, for his part, testified somewhat similarly when asked \nwhether Defendant’s fixation on the belief that he already pled guilty was “more consistent with a \n \n20 Defendant (through counsel) has asserted, and the government has not disputed, that the sentencing guidelines \nrange is lower than the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months.  \n \n21 The court credits and appreciates the testimony and work of Dr. Sharf and Dr. Cloutier in this case. The court \nfinds they testified credibly and put forth extensive efforts, under difficult circumstances, in evaluating and \nattempting to work with Defendant to assess and restore his competency.  Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 32 of 3533 \n psychosis or a personality disorder,”  explaining that  he was “just not sure” and “it is difficult to tease \nthe two apart .” (Id. at 143.) The experts agree that if Defendant’s competency -related issues are \ndriven by a personality disorder, rather than psychosis, then the proposed antipsychotic medication \nwill not help to restore his competency. Dr. Cloutier also introduced a third potential d iagnosis —\ncatatonia —which requires treatment with lorazepam before the antipsychotic medication is \nadministered. While the court appreciates that Dr. Cloutier was able to observe Defendant’s \nbehavior during the Sell hearing and adjust his treatment plan in accordance with those observations, \nthe shifting nature of the specific treatment plan and Defendant’s diagnoses over time do not instill \nthis court with the necessary confidence to forcibly medicate Defendant with  potentially risky drugs.  \nSee White , 620 F.3d at 421 (discussing “the ambiguity involved in medicating an individual with [the \ndefendant’s] particular medical c ondition”).  \nAs to the risks of haloperidol in particular, the most concerning side effects are sudden \ncardiac death and tardive dyskinesia . Although sudden cardiac death is extremely rare, tardive \ndyskinesia is more common, it s likelihood accumulates over time, and it can be irreversible. \nMoreover, the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia and other movement disorders caused by haloperidol   \ncan interfere with a Defendant’s ability to assist in his defense. See Grigsby , 712 F.3d at 975.  \nThe record does contain some evidence that Defendant was given a dose of haloperidol \nintravenously at Massachusetts General Hospital in 2021, likely for agitation, and there are no \nindications that Defendant suffered an allergic reaction thereafter. But th ere is also no indication \nthat Defendant has ever received haloperidol by injection for psychosis, much less that he had a \npositive response to such treatment. Dr. Cloutier cited Defendant’s age and that “ it sounds like he’s \nsort of in the early . . . phas e of a major psychotic disorder”  as positive factors in favor of treatment \nwith haloperidol.  (Dkt. No. 164 at 90 -91.) However, he conceded  on cross examination  that \nDefendant’s psychosis “could potentially have gone back” to his hospitalizations at the Darnall Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 33 of 3534 \n Army Medical Center in 2015 , in which case Defendant is “less likely [to have] a positive response” \nto the medication. ( Id. at 116. ) The court finds the latter scenario is more likely, given Defendant’s \nextensive and concerning medical and criminal history. Moreover, as Dr. Cloutier explained in his \nreport, Defendant’s “poor insight into his mental illness, the number of years untreated, and sparse \ntreatment history, all limit his chances of responding to antipsychotic medication.” ( Dkt. No. 140 at \n5.) \nIn the end, the court finds there are simply too many unanswered questions surrounding \nDefendant’s medical condition(s) and likely response to the proposed tr eatment. In addition,  the \ngovernmental interest in this prosecution is substantially weakened , in light of the likelihood of civil \ncommitment and the significant period of pretrial confinement . The court concludes the \ngovernment has not satisfied its burden “to warrant the extraordinary use of forcible medication to \nrender [Defendant] competent to stan d trial.” Grigsby , 712 F.3d at 976; see Berry , 911 F.3d at 357 \n(“The drastic step of administering these powerful drugs to an unwilling criminal defendant should \nbe taken rarely, and only when absolutely necessary to fulfill an important governmental interest, to \navoid deprivation of the defendant’s ‘liberty . . . without due process of law.’” (quoting U.S. Const. \namends V, XIV § 1)).  \nIn light of this finding, the court also concludes that there is not “a substantial probability \nthat in the foreseeable future [Defendant] will attain the capacity to permit the proceedings to go \nforward.” 18 U.S.C. § 4241(d). However,  Defendant is still “subject to the provisions of section \n4246” and shall remain detained pending adjudication of the civil commitment proceedings in the \nEastern District of North Carolina. 18 U.S.C. § 4241(d) ; see 18 U.S. C. § 4246(a)  (“A certificate filed \nunder this subsection shall stay the release of the person pending completion of procedures \ncontained in this section. ”). \n Case 4:22-cr-40001-MGM     Document 167     Filed 01/07/25     Page 34 of 3535 \n IV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the court DENIES the Government’s Motion for Involuntary  \nAdminis tration of Antipsychotic Medication. (Dkt.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Sophia O'Neill, a teaching assistant at the University of Pennsylvania, claimed that a male student, identified as HR, sexually harassed and intimidated her, creating a hostile work environment, and asserted claims of constructive discharge and retaliation after she reported his behavior. Despite documenting HR's inappropriate conduct, the court found insufficient evidence to hold the University liable under federal law, as the student was not an employee, and the University had acted promptly to address her concerns. There was no involvement of artificial intelligence, machine learning, or automated systems in this case, though O'Neill was part of the university's robotics and autonomous systems program.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the University can be held liable for the alleged hostile work environment, constructive discharge, and retaliation claims by the teaching assistant, based on the conduct of a non-employee student.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted summary judgment in favor of the University on all claims, finding that O'Neill failed to produce evidence that would allow a jury to find the University liable for HR's conduct under federal law. The court emphasized that the University took appropriate remedial actions promptly upon learning of the harassment.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A woman working at her old university complained that a student made her feel uncomfortable and threatened, leading her to quit her job. She took the university to court, claiming it was responsible for what happened. The court looked at the situation and decided that the university acted quickly to help her once they knew about it, so they weren't at fault under the law.",

October 31, 2025 \nA woman working in her alma mater university as a teaching assistant and lab manager \nclaims one of the larger male students in her lab harassed  and physically intimidated her in \nFebruary of the Spring 2023 semester, including sending her  romantic  messages over a holiday \nweekend during the male student’s psychotic depression episode which she later construed as \nsexual harassment . The teaching assistant adduced evidence of the male student’s improper \nrepeated conduct. She told the university immediately upon discovering the improper messages  \nafter the holiday weekend . The university enacted a safety plan including precluding physical \ninteraction between the male student and the t eaching assistant. The teaching assistant remained \nupset and would not return to work unless the university met her demand of precluding its male \nstudent from working in the lab or interacting with her . The university implemented a plan but did \nnot agree to all the teaching assistant’s requests and she did not return to work. The teaching assistant further claims a university professor gave a job reference to a potential employer which  \nlater withdrew its employment offer after she filed a complaint with a Philadelphia Board. The \nteaching assistant assumes, despite direct contrary denials, the university professor knew of  her \ncomplaint at the time he gave his reference to her prospective employer.  Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 1 of 342 \n The question today is whether the teaching assistant can proceed on hostile work \nenvironment, constructive discharge, and retaliation claims against her former employer university \nbased on conduct by a student non- employee of the university. We agree with the teaching assistant \nas to the nature and pervasiveness of the male student’s improper conduct both before and during \nhis psychotic episode. His conduct cannot be excused,  and we appreciate the teaching assistant’s \nconcern. But she adduced no evidence which would allow a jury to find the university could be liable to its employee  teaching assistant  for creating a sex -based hostile work environment based \non the male  student’s conduct, constructive discharge when she left employment, or retaliation. \nWe are guided in part from recent comprehensive analysis from the  Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit (absent guidance from our Court of Appeals) persuading us the teaching assistant must show the university was substantially certain its actions would cause ha rassment . The teaching \nassistant d id not adduce evidence meeting  this standard. And the teaching assistant also d id not \nadduce evidence meeting  the analogous “knew or should have known” standard  applied by other \ncolleagues  based on  administrative  agency guidance . We agree the teaching assistant adduced \nevidence under state law not before us for a jury to consider against the student for his conduct . \nBut she has not adduced evidence allowing a jury to find her university employer liable under \nfederal law when the stu dent harasser is not a university employee . We grant the university’s \nMotion for summary judgment finding no evidence of a sex -based hostile work environment \ncreated or fostered by the university or otherwise creating a genuine issue of material fact on the teaching assistant’s constructive discharge or retaliation claims.  \nI. Undisputed Material Facts\n1 \n \nThe University of Pennsylvania offers  a one-year “Master of Science in Design: Robotics \nand Autonomous Systems” degree through its Stuart Weitzman School of Design.2 The University Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 2 of 343 \n intends for its program to allow  students to “explor[e] architectural design through [artificial \nintelligence] and robotic fabrication.”3 The University granted Sophia O’Neill a master’s degree \nin Robotics and Autonomous Systems in 2022.4 She then began working for the University in two \nroles in Fall 2022.  \nShe started as a full -time Research Associate— also known as a Lab Manager —in the \nAdvanced Research and Innovation Robotics Lab for the Stuart Weitzman School of Design.5 The \nUniversity required Ms. O’Neill to be responsible for “[s]upport[ing] student coursework and \nfaculty research activities” in the Robotics Lab including completing and cleaning up after robot tasks in the lab.\n6 The University required Ms. O’Neill work in person in the Robotics Lab.7 Senior \nExecutive Director Karl Wellman and Program Director Robert Stuart -Smith supervised Ms. \nO’Neill in the Robotics Lab.8 She worked with Lab Manager  Nick Sideropolous .  \nMs. O’Neill also worked as a Teaching Assistant in the Robotics and Autonomous Systems \nprogram in the Fall 2022 semester.9 Her Teaching Assistant  role included helping students with \nassignments.10 Ms. O’Neill served as a T eaching Assistant for P rogram Director  Stuart -Smith’s \nstudio course and for Jeffrey Anderson’s lecture -based course i n the Spring 2023 semester.11  \nEight students complained about fellow Student HR in Fall 2022.  \n University Student HR , a six-feet-four- inches tall man , participated  in the Robotics Lab \nwhile  Ms. O’Neill  and Mr. Sideropolous  worked as Lab Manager s.12 Eight students —seven men \nand one woman—complained about Student HR’s conduct in the Lab.13 The sole woman student \nto complain is identified as Student 1; she emailed Pro gram Director  Stuart -Smith on October 2, \n2022 about Student HR’s aggressive conduct in her s tudent group hoping his conduct was not \nrelated to her gender.14 Two men students along with Student 1 emailed Program Director Stuart -\nSmith a month later addressing issues they had working with HR.15 Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 3 of 344 \n  Ms. O’Neill did not report concerns with Student HR during the Fall 2022 semester. But \ntoday -  in this case -  Ms. O’Neill claims  Student  HR operated the  Lab’s  robots at “unsafe” speeds  \nduring the Fall 2022 semester .16 She also claims HR would ask her for help with his assignments \nwithout completing work beforehand and would physically intimidate her by hovering over her \ndesk at least once a week .17 Student HR did not hover over Lab Manager  Sideropolous.18 But Ms. \nO’Neill cannot recall  report ing HR made her feel physically intimidated  during the Fall 2022 \nsemester.19 Ms. O’Neill did not report HR engaged in sexually harassing behavior in Fall 2022.20 \nStudent HR’s aggressive conduct towards Ms. O’Neill in the Spring 2023 Semester. \n Ms. O’Neill  noted concerns about  Student  HR early in  the Spring 2023 semester. Student \nHR blocked Ms. O’Neill’s path to her desk on February 3, 2023 after she returned to the Robotics Lab following a work happy hour.\n21 Student  HR emailed Program Director  Stuart -Smith accus ing \nMs. O’Neill of being “tipsy.”22 Student HR hovered over Ms. O’Neill’s desk and demanded she \ngive him answers to an assignment on February 20, 2023.23 Ms. O’Neill told Program Director  \nStuart -Smith HR asked her for the answers to the assignment but cannot remember whether she \nalso told him HR hovered over her desk.24 \n Student HR also wait ed for Ms. O’Neill outside of the Robotics Lab when she arrived for \nwork at 8:45 AM on February 22, 2023.25 He blocked Ms. O’Neill’s path again later in the morning \nwhile she was trying to exit from a separate room housing a robot  until Ms. O’Neill asked him to \nmove .26  \nMs. O’Neill left the room housing the robot, went to her desk, and opened several messages \nHR had sent her on messaging platform Discord  between  Saturday  February 18, 2023 and Tuesday  \nFebruary 21, 2023 which included:  Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 4 of 345 \n • Saturday  February 18 at 7:31 AM :  HR: “Hey, [ S]oph. I think I’m going too deep \ninto depression. Please come home and stay with me if you can.”27 HR continued “Love you so \nmuch babe . . . come soon” with a heart emoji and a kissing face emoji  at 8:02 PM .28  \n• Sunday February 19 at 2:43 AM: tried to call Ms. O’Neill.29  \n• Sunday February 19 after the attempted middle -of-the-night call: HR messaged, \n“Sorry. I had a depressive psychotic episode the past three days. I’m fine today”  at 3:40 PM.30 \n• Tuesday February 21 at 1:25 AM: HR messaged “Going to surprise you” with a \nheart emoji.31   \nHR confirmed his depressive and psychotic episodes over this Presidents’ Day holiday \nweekend. He called Program Director  Stuart -Smith on  Saturday  February 18 and message d him  \non February 19: “Sorry for calling you yesterday. I had a depressive psychotic episode on Friday \nand Saturday. Called you because I needed to be helped[.] Almost back to normal today. My doctor \nprescribed me some medicine for it.”32 \nMs. O’Neill reports HR’s behavior on February 22, 2023 upon seeing his messages. \n HR did not reference a romantic attraction to Ms. O’Neill until his Presidents’ Day Holiday \nWeekend Discord messages.33 Ms. O’Neill  immediately  reported the se inappropriate romantic  \nmessages to her supervisor Senior Executive Director  Wellman after she opened them  on February \n22, 2023.34 Senior Executive Director Wellman and Ms. O’Neill then walked together to Associate \nDirector of Student Support Kayla Richards ’s office.35 Associate Director  Richards, Senior \nExecutive Director Wellman, and Ms. O’Neill then talked to the University’s Director of Special Services for the Division of Public Safety Paige Wigginton over the phone.\n36  \nThe University removed HR from the Robotics Lab by 12:30  PM on Wednesday February \n22, 2023 within a couple hours of Ms. O’Neill learning of the inappropriate Discord messages .37 Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 5 of 346 \n Ms. O’Neill then returned  to the Lab  to collect her belongings and go home for the day.38 Ms. \nO’Neill described the messages as not “ particularly sexual ” in a March 9, 2023 email to her uncle \nbut later described them as sexual .39  \nThe University develops a safety plan for Ms. O’Neill.  \n The University developed a safety plan for Ms. O’Neill  shortly after speaking with her and \nStudent HR.40 The safety plan  limited HR to using the Robotics Lab only when Lab Manager \nSideropolous  work ed.41 It also prohibited HR from speaking with Ms. O’Neill outside of an \nacademic setting.42 The University told HR he could also face disciplinary proceedings with the \nUniversity’s Office of Community Standards and Accountability if he violated this safety plan.43 \nUniversity Director Wigginton and Lauren Rudick—the Director of Student Intervention \nServices —met with HR to explain the safety plan to him.44 HR agreed to the plan .45  \nBut Ms. O’Neill wanted “a guarantee [she] would never have to interact with” HR.46 Ms. \nO’Neill wanted assurance HR could not access the Robotics Lab even when  she was not working \ndespite HR need ing access to the Lab to complete his degree.47  \nMs. O’Neill does not return to work.  \nMs. O’Neill did not return to work after February 22, 2023 but the University continued to \npay her and she continued to receive benefits.48 Senior Executive Director Wellman  asked Ms. \nO’Neill to return to work by March 27, 2023 unless she applied for a formal leave in a March 17, 2023 letter.\n49 Senior Executive Director Wellman told Ms. O’Neill he  would consider her to have \nabandoned her position if she did not return by March 27 without applying for a formal leave.50 \nMs. O’Neill confirmed she would not return to work on March 22, 2023.51 HR did not contact Ms. \nO’Neill between February 22, 2023 and March 27, 2023 but did post on Instagram on March 5, 2023 to complain about her decision to report his behavior.\n52  Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 6 of 347 \n A prospective employer withdraws an employment offer to Ms. O’Neill.  \n Ms. O’Neill hired a lawyer who filed a complaint with the Philadelphia Commission on \nHuman Relations on May 5, 2023 alleging, among other things, Program Director Stuart -Smith \ntold Ms. O’Neill to “consider hiring a security guard” and objected to Ms. O’Neill transferring \nfrom the Lab “unless she agreed to continue as Teaching Assistant for his studio, which would requi re contact with her harasser.”\n53 Ms. O’Neill through counsel  sent notice of her complaint to \nthe University’s general counsel’s office the same day.54 Ms. O’Neill also began looking for a job  \nand applied for a position with Hyperion Robotics  which extended a  preliminary  offer on July 1, \n2023 and sent her an employment contract on July 10, 2023.55 Hyperion Robotics withdrew its \noffer on July 12, 2023 “[a]fter understanding new information about [Ms. O’Neill’s] past work with [her] listed references.”\n56  \nProgram Director Stuart -Smith likely agreed to be an  employment  reference for Ms. \nO’Neill  at the time Ms. O’Neill applied for the Lab Manager position .57 She also listed Program \nDirector Stuart -Smith on the resume she sent to Hyperion Robotics.58 He swore he only gave \nHyperion Robotics information on Ms. O’Neill’s degree.59 He did not know about Ms. O’Neill’s \nMay 5, 2023 Philadelphia Complaint until August 18, 2023 when the University’s general counsel \nemailed him about it.60 Program Director Stuart -Smith described himself as “unhappy with the \nway” Ms. O’Neill portrayed the events in her allegations.61 Ms. O’Neill amended her complaint \nwith the Philadelphia Commission on August 23, 2023 to add a retaliation claim after Hyperion Robotics withdrew its offe r six weeks earlier .\n62  \nMs. O’Neill  then sued the University  for creating and fostering a sex -based  hostile work \nenvironment, for constructive discharge,  and for retaliation under Title VII and the Philadelphia \nFair Practices Ordinance.63 Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 7 of 348 \n II. Analysis  \nThe University  move s for summary judgment on Ms. O’Neill’s hostile work environment, \nconstructive discharge, and retaliation claims.64 Ms. O’Neill opposes.65 We studied voluminous \nmaterials adduced in discovery and otherwise mindful of the deference to the non- moving party’s \narguments.66 Our study did not uncover a genuinely disputed issue of fact material to Ms. O’Neill’s \nthree claims or the University’s defenses. We grant summary judgment for the University on all \nclaims.  \nA. We dismiss Ms. O’Neill’s sex -based hostile work environment claim.  \nMs. O’Neill claims the University is liable under Title VII and the Philadelphia Fair \nPractices Ordinance for creating a hostile work environment based on HR’s conduct.67 The \nUniversity moves for summary judgment on Ms. O’Neill’s hostile work environment claims and argues Ms. O’Neill has not adduced evidence to show HR harassed her because of her sex, HR’s harassment was severe or pervasive, or the University is liable for  the harassment.\n68 Ms. O’Neill \nresponds she adduced evidence of genuinely disputed material facts in support of her sex -based \nhostile work environment claim.69 We agree with the University. Ms. O’Neill has not adduced \nevidence to show it can be liable for HR’s conduct or otherwise created a sex -based hostile work \nenvironment in February 2023. \nMs. O’Neill must establish the following five elements to hold the University  liable for a \nhostile work environment based on sexual harassment: (1) she “suffered intentional discrimination \nbecause of [her] sex,” (2) “the discrimination was severe or pervasive,” (3) “the discrimination \ndetrimentally affected”  her, (4) “the discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person \nin like circumstances,” and (5) there is a basis for “employer liability.”70  We find genuine issues \nof material fact on the sex -based harassment which a jury may find severe or pervasive. But we Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 8 of 349 \n find no evidence which would allow a jury to find the University liable for Student HR’s sex- based \nhostile conduct in mid- February 2023.  \n1. A reasonable jury could find HR harassed Ms. O’Neill because of her \nsex in February 2023. \n \nThe University argues we should grant summary judgment because there is no evidence  \nHR discriminated against Ms. O’Neill because of her sex.71 Ms. O’Neill responds HR’s hovering \nover her while asking for help with work, blocking her path, and sending her the February 2023 \ntext messages all show HR intentionally discriminated against her because of her sex.72 The \nUniversity replies the February 2023 text messages cannot show intentional sex discrimination \nbecause Ms. O’Neill described the text messages as not “particularly sexual” in an email to her uncle.\n73 We find Ms. O’Neill produced evidence a reasonable jury could use to find HR harassed \nher because of her sex.  \nAn employee can show “[t]he intent to discriminate on the basis of sex” where someone \nengages in explicitly sexual conduct such as “in cases involving sexual propositions, innuendo, pornographic materials, or sexual derogatory language.”\n74 But an employee can still show \nintentional discrimination because of sex even if the “conduct or statements” at issue are not \n“explicitly sexual.”75 The employee need only show “that gender [was] a substantial factor in the \ndiscrimination.”76 \nViewing the record in a light most favorable to Ms. O’Neill there are facts a reasonable \njury could use to find HR harassed her because of her sex. HR sent Ms. O’Neill several text \nmessages in February 2023 where he told her he “love[s] [her] so much” with a heart emoji and \nkissing face emoji, asked her to come over to his home, and told her he was “[g]oing to surprise [her]” with a heart emoji.\n77 A reasonable jury could find HR engaged in these romantic advances \nand confessions of love because of Ms. O’Neill’s sex especially considering HR sent Program Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 9 of 3410 \n Director  Stuart -Smith a message during the same timeframe devoid of romantic overtures.78 Ms. \nO’Neill also stated  HR would not hover over Lab Manager Sideropolous the way HR would hover \nover her.79 A reasonable jury could thus also find HR physically intimidat ed Ms. O’Neill by \nhovering over her or blocking her path because of her sex.80 We deny the University’s motion for \nsummary judgment on this ground. \n2. A reasonable jury could find HR’s harassment was severe or pervasive.  \nThe University argues HR’s behavior —including hovering over Ms. O’Neill, blocking Ms. \nO’Neill’s way, and sending her messages  over the holiday weekend—does not amount to severe \nor pervasive harassment.81 Ms. O’Neill responds a reasonable jury could conclude HR’s behavior \naltered Ms. O’Neill’s employment.82 We find Ms. O’Neill adduced enough evidence for a \nreasonable jury to find she experienced severe or pervasive harassment.  \nHarassment is only severe or pervasive if it “alter[s] the conditions of [the victim’s] \nemployment and create[s] an abusive working environment.”83 We determine whether harassment \ncreates a hostile or abusive work environment by “consider[ing] the totality of the circumstances, \nincluding ‘the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee’s work performance.’”\n84 We cannot base our analysis on “individual incidents” \nand instead must evaluate “the overall scenario.”85 For example, physically threatening behavior —\nespecially when coupled with unwanted comments or attention—might tip the scale towards finding harassment to be severe or pervasive when considering the totality of the circumstances.\n86 \nWe focus our analysis here on specific comments or incidents.87 Ms. O’Neill argues  a jury  \ncould conclude  HR created a hostile work environment by: (1) hovering over desk while asking \nfor help with work at least once per week  during the Fall 2022 semester, (2) blocking Ms. O’Neill’s \npath to her desk on February 3, 2023 after she returned to the Robotics Lab following a work happy Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 10 of 3411 \n hour, (3) hovering over Ms. O’Neill’s desk and demanding the answers to an assignment on \nFebruary 20, 2023, (4) trying to call Ms. O’Neill and sending her messages between February 18 and February 21, 2023, and (5) blocking Ms. O’Neill’s path on February 2 2, 2023.\n88  \nWe have no basis to find alleged and unreported conduct in the Fall 2022 semester is sex-\nbased.  But we are persuaded  a reasonable jury could find HR physically intimated or threatened \nMs. O’Neill and made unwanted romantic advances toward her in February 2023 given the content of the messages HR sent Ms. O’Neill —where he professed his love for her and told her he was \n“[g]oing to surprise her” —and HR’s frequent hovering over her and blocking her path in February \n2023. The evidence suggest Student HR tried t o, at a minimum, intimidate Ms. O’Neill. We find \nevidence a reasonable jury could use to find HR’s harassment was severe or pervasive enough to \nalter Ms. O’Neill’s conditions of employment. We deny summary judgment on this ground. \n3. No reasonable jury could find the University liable for a sex -based \nhostile work environment . \nThe University argues it cannot be liable for HR’s harassment of Ms. O’Neill even if his \nbehavior otherwise satisfies the elements needed to establish a hostile work environment claim.\n89 \nThe University raises two points. It first argue s we should depart from our colleagues ’ “know or \nshould have known”  standard for holding employers liable for a non -employee’s harassment and \ninstead adopt the  intent approach described less than three months ago by the Court of Appeals for \nthe Sixth Circuit in Bivens v. Zep, Inc.90 The University argues  Ms. O’Neill did not adduce  \nevidence a reasonable jury could use to find the University intended for HR to harass her.91 It next \nargue s Ms. O’Neill cannot show University is  liable for HR’s harassment even if we follow a \n“knew or should have known”  approach.92 Ms. O’Neill chose to address th e intent  argument \nderived from the Court of Appeals’ Bivens analysis in a footnote .93 She instead focuses her Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 11 of 3412 \n response on arguing the University failed to take appropriate remedial action after Ms. O’Neill \nreported the sexual harassment.94 \na. An employer must either desire the intended harassment or be \nsubstantially certain it will occur to be liable for conduct by persons not in its employ who harass its employee.  \nWe first address whether  an employee like Ms. O’Neill can hold an employer  like the \nUniversity  liable for a non -employee’s harassment. Our Court of Appeals  has not explicitly held \nshe can.\n95 But our colleagues consistently hold an employee can hold an employer liable for a non-\nemployee’s harassment —such as a student’s harassment —under limited fact- specific  \ncircumstances.96 We agree.  \nThe more pressing question is when  an employee can hold an employer liable for a non -\nemployee’s harassment. The Courts of Appeals for the First, Second, Fourth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, \nand Eleventh Circuits instruct  an employee can hold an employer liable for a non- employee’s \nharassment when the employer “ knew or should have known”  of the harassing conduct and failed \nto take immediate and appropriate action.97 These Courts of Appeals  often base their reasoning on \nnon-binding Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidance.98 Our Court of Appeals has \nnot addressed this issue directly or in a precedential opinion.99 But several of our colleagues have \nadopted this “knew or should have known” approach based on the then- existing circuit opinions.100  \nThe Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit  fulsomely  addressed this issue approximately \nthree months ago in Bivens v. Zep, Inc .101 The employee in Bivens  sued her former employer after \nher employer’s client locked her in his office and asked her if they could date while she was on a \nsales call.102 It claims to have departed from the “knew or should have known” standard (or so -\ncalled negligence  standard) when deciding whether the employer could be liable when its client \nharassed its employee.103 The Court of Appeals instructed, in a post -Loper Bright world, we should \nnot simply parrot an agency interpretation.104 It instead held an employer can only be liable for a Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 12 of 3413 \n non-employee’s harassment when the employer intended the harassment —meaning when the \nemployer either “‘desire[d]’ an unlawful consequence from his actions or [was] ‘substantially \ncertain’ that it [would] result.”105 The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reached this result \nafter careful review of agency law.106 It explained although Congress through  Title VII typically \nrequires intentional actions for liability , employers may be liable for their employees’ harassment \nbased on their own negligence because “agency law principles dictate that a harasser’s unlawful \nintent may be imputed to the employer based only on the employer’s negligence in allowing the \nharassmen t.”107 But it noted agency law cannot “impute . . . wrongful intent” to an employer where \nthere is no agency relationship—such as the relationship between an employer and most non-\nemployees.108 It thus declined to follow the “knew or should have known”  approach because (1) \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission likely did not have authority to issue the guidance relied on and (2) they relied on the guidance without a separate analysis based in agency \nlaw principles.\n109 \nWe have no binding precedent within our Circuit guiding our analysis. But we are \npersuaded by the  Court of Appeals for the  Sixth Circuit’s approach and predict our Court of \nAppeals would align with it.  \nBut we also today apply the “knew or should have known” standard applied by many \ncolleagues before the standard offered by the Court of Appeals in Bivens. We do not discern much \ndifference with the “knew or should have known” analysis other than turning “should have known” to a “substantially certain” harassment would follow from its actions. We cannot discern how an employer “should have known” about conduc t by persons not under its control or authority under \nagency law. The employer does not monitor all i nteractions of its employees with third parties.  \nWe appreciate a university has some control over its students including through discipline which Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 13 of 3414 \n would not be true in a typical customer interaction with an employee. But the disciplinary process \ndoes not afford the university a prescient foresight to know which students may engage in sex-based harassment of its employees. We cannot discern how a university employer can be liable unless it knows of the student’s sex- based harassment and allows or fosters the hostile work \nenvironment. It faces a different challenge once it knows of the risk of sex -based harassment from \na student or is substantially cert ain harassment will occur from its conduct. \nWe find the University can only be liable for HR’s harassment where it intended the \nharassment to occur because it either “‘desire[d] to cause’ [the] harassment or was ‘substantially certain’ that it would ‘result from’ its actions.”\n110  But we today apply the “knew or should have \nknown” standard as well.   \nb. A reasonable jury could not find the University intended or \nshould have known HR would  sexually harass Ms. O’Neill.  \nThe University argues Ms. O’Neill has not adduced evidence to show it “desired or was \nsubstantially certain” HR would harass Ms. O’Neill.111 Ms. O’Neill does not address whether there \nis evidence showing the University intended the harassment.112 We agree with the University  at \nleast when, like today, the University promptly implemented a plan to stop the harassment of Ms. \nO’Neill while she worked for the University . We would face a much different situation if the \nUniversity did not promptly act in response to Ms. O’Neill’s concerns and the harassment \ncontinued. \nIn applying the Court of Appeals’ Bivens analysis, an employer is liable for a non-\nemployee’s harassment when the employer either “desire[d]” the harassment or was “substantially certain” it would result.\n113 For example, a jury could find an employer intended for sexual \nharassment to occur where it instructs an employee to be “‘especially cordial’ to a certain client” Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 14 of 3415 \n and to “keep him satisfied” or “do[es] nothing despite knowing that a mentally ill patient was \nrepeatedly grabbing nurses in a sexual manner.”114 \nMs. O’Neill did not adduce evidence the University or its employees knew HR physically \nintimidated or  confessed unreciprocated romantic feelings for Ms. O’Neill until she reported his \nbehavior to Senior Executive Director Wellman on February 22, 2023.115 Ms. O’Neill did not \nreport his harassing behavior to anyone with the University e ven though Ms. O’Neill felt HR \nphysically intimidated her during the Fall 2022 semester.116 Ms. O’Neill report ed to Program \nDirector  Stuart -Smith about HR asking for answers to an assignment on February 20, 2023 but \ncannot remember telling  him HR hovered over her desk while doing so.117 We are mindful Student \n1 reported HR’s behavior in a group project to P rogram Director Stuart -Smith in October 2022 but \nshe could not describe his behavior as sex- based; she instead hoped his behavior was unrelated to \nher gender . But a  reasonable jury could not find Program Director Stuart -Smith’s  knowledge of \nHR’s difficult group work behavior in October 2022 to Student 1 (with no references or concerns \nto Ms. O’Neill) would make the University substantially certain he would go on to physically \nintimidate and sexually harass Ms. O’Neill in February 2023.  \nWe reach the same result even if we do not apply the Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit’s Bivens analysis.  Our Court of Appeals has not addressed the state of mind for the \nuniversity employers in these sex- based hostile work environment claims although our colleagues \nhave applied a “knew or should have known” standard. So, to ensure Ms. O’Neill of our fulsome \nreview, we now turn to whether she adduced evidence sufficient to meet this almost -identical Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 15 of 3416 \n standard of “knew or should have known” liability. We scoured the record and cannot find a \ngenuine issue of material fact allowing a jury to evaluate this issue. \nWe recognize our colleagues —before the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit’s Bivens  \nanalysis —looked to other c ourts of a ppeals and determined an employer can be liable when a non -\nemployee harasses its employee “where the employer (or its agents or supervisory employees) knows or should have known of the conduct and fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action.”\n118 The first portion of this analysis asks us to determine whether the employer had “actual \nor constructive knowledge of harassment.”119 The second portion asks  us to determine “the \nadequacy of the employer’s remedial and preventative responses.”120 This remedial obligation  is \ncritical because an employer’s liability “is grounded not in the harassing act itself but in the \nemployer’s . . . ratification of the harassment through its failure to take appropriate and reasonable \nresponsive action.”121 The University knew about HR’s harassment when Ms. O’Neill reported it \non February 22, 2023.122 The issue under this test is whether a reasonable jury could find the \nUniversity failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action after learning about the \nharassment.  \nA remedial action is adequate if it stops the harassment.123 But a remedial action can still \nbe adequate even if it fails to stop the harassment if it was “reasonably calculated to prevent future \nharassment” at the time the employer implemented it.124 We are guided by our Court of Appeals ’s \nfinding a remedial action is  reasonably calculated to prevent further harassment —even though its \neffectiveness could not be tested because the employee quit —where  the employer’s management  \n(1) warned the harasser the “company does not tolerate any sexual comments or actions” and he \nmay be “suspen[ded]” or “terminat[ed]” if he violates the policy, (2) required the harasser to \n“restore [the employee] to the [work] schedule immediately” after he had removed the employee Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 16 of 3417 \n from the schedule, and (3) informed the employee “she should contact the company at any time \nregarding any improper language or sexual advances.”125 Our colleagues  have gone on to find \nother remedial actions to be adequate where management responded to the report of harassment \n“without delay,” met with the harasser and warned him he could be fired if the harassment did not stop, and changed shifts so the harasser and victim would not work together.\n126 \nThe adduced evidence confirms Senior Executive Director Wellman walked with Ms. \nO’Neill to the Associate Director of Student Support’s office immediately after Ms. O’Neill \nreport ed HR’s messages.127 They then met with the Director of Special Services for the Division \nof Public Safety.128 The University removed HR from the Robotics Lab by 12:30 PM the same \nday so Ms. O’Neill could collect her belongings and go home.129 The University then developed a \nsafety plan for Ms. O’Neill which limited HR to using the Robotics Lab when her Lab co -Manager \nMr. Sideropolous was available  and prohibited HR from speaking with Ms. O’Neill outside of an \nacademic setting .130 The Director of Special Services for the Division of Public Safety and an \nemployee with the University’s Student Intervention Services met with HR to explain the plan to \nhim.131 HR would face disciplinary proceedings before the University’s Office of Community \nStandards and Accountability if he violated the plan.132 HR verbally agreed to follow the safety \nplan.133 \nMs. O’Neill wanted more. She demanded the University prevent HR from accessing the \nRobotics Lab even when she was not working. But  an employee “cannot object to” the remedy the \nemployer chooses “if the remedy chosen . . . is adequate” or “dictate that the employer select a certain remedial action.”\n134 The University’s implemented  plan prevent ed HR from working with \nMs. O’Neill in the Robotics Lab and from contacting her outside of an academic setting while also Case 2:25-cv-01129-MAK     Document 43     Filed 10/31/25     Page 17 of 3430 \n  \nmany of the circuit cases that nominally apply a negligence standard would likely have been \nresolved the same way under the intent standard we adopt”).  \n \n104 See id. at 646 (citing Loper Bright Enters. v.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\n\nIn *Carson v. Google Hackers, CIA Handler*, the plaintiff, Thomas Carson Jr., filed a lawsuit against unnamed \"Google Hackers\" and a \"CIA Handler,\" claiming, among other things, that his email was hacked and his mind was controlled through AI by these defendants. The court considered his application to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) and ultimately dismissed the complaint for lack of clarity and coherence, but allowed Carson the opportunity to amend his complaint. Carson's request for appointed counsel was denied as premature due to insufficient attempts to secure legal representation on his own. AI is involved in Carson's claim as he alleges to be a victim of mind hacking and seeks freedom from artificial intelligence.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\n\nThe key legal issue is whether Carson's complaint sufficiently stated a plausible claim for relief under Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and whether it provided clear and concise claims and grounds for jurisdiction.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\n\nThe court held that Carson's complaint was too convoluted and failed to meet the basic pleading requirements under Rules 8 and 10. Therefore, the court recommended the complaint be dismissed but allowed Carson to amend his filing to clearly outline his claims and legal basis.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\n\nImagine you paint a picture so messy and jumbled that no one can tell what it is supposed to be. That's what Carson did with his lawsuit against \"Google Hackers\" and a \"CIA Handler.\" The court said he needs to paint a clearer picture by organizing his thoughts so that others can understand what happened and why he wants to sue. The court will give him another chance to fix it, but he needs to do more groundwork, like trying to find a lawyer himself before the court considers giving him one. Carson also claimed computers were reading his mind, which is why AI is mentioned.",

No. 2), the Court finds Plaintiff meet s this standard .  \nTherefore, his IFP Application is granted. 1  \nTurning to his complaint, Plaintiff appears to assert hackers infiltrated his email in March \n2020, and stole personal information from his computer.   (See generally , Dkt. No. 1; Dkt. No. 1  \nat 2.)  Plaintiff also asserts his “mind was hacked” and he is a victim of government experiments \nand torture.  Id. at 2 -3.  In his prayer for relief, Plaintiff requests “freedom from Google hacker \nand artificial  intelligence and also sue google and the CIA handler.”  Id. at 4.   \nThe Court is mindful that a pro se  litigant ’s pleadings  are held to a less strict standard \nthan attorney  drafted pleadings .

However, the current status of Plaintiff’s  complaint is so convoluted and \ndifficult to interpret that the Court cannot accept it as  filed.   \nRule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a pleading must contain:  \n(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds for the court’s \njurisdiction . .  . ;  \n \n(2) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \npleader is entitled to relief; and   \n \n(3) a demand for the relief sought, which may include relief in the \nalternative or different types of relief.  \n \nFed.

Plaintiff's\ncomplaint alleges defendants violated his constitutional rights\nwhile he was an inmate at Green Haven Correctional\nFacility.1 Plaintiff's complaint was dismissed sua sponte  by\nJudge Thomas P. Griesa on June 26, 1995 pursuant to \n 28\nU.S.C. § 1915(d) . On September 26, 1995, the Second Circuit\nCourt of Appeals vacated the judgment and remanded the case\nto the district court for further proceedings.\nThe case was reassigned to Judge Barbara S. Jones on\nJanuary 31, 1996. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c)  on November 25, 1996.\nThereafter, the case was reassigned to Judge Jed S. Rakoff\non February 26, 1997. On February 26, 1998, Judge Rakoff\ngranted defendants' motion to dismiss, but vacated the\njudgment on April 10, 1998 in response to plaintiff's motion\nfor reconsideration in which plaintiff claimed that he never\nreceived defendants' motion to dismiss.By Judge Rakoff's Order dated April 14, 1998, this case was\nreferred to me for general pretrial purposes and for a Report\nand Recommendation on any dispositive motion. Presently\npending is defendants' renewed motion to dismiss. Plaintiff\nfiled a reply on July 6, 1998. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, plaintiff's complaint is dismissed without prejudice,\nand plaintiff is granted leave to replead within thirty (30) days\nof the date of the entry of this order.\nFACTS\nPlaintiff alleges that he was assaulted by four inmates in the\nGreen Haven Correctional Facility mess hall on March 14,\n1995. (Complaint at 4.) He alleges that he was struck with\na pipe and a fork while in the “pop room” between 6:00\np.m. and 6:30 p.m. (Complaint at 4–5.) Plaintiff contends\nthat the attack left him with 11 stitches in his head, chronic\nheadaches , nightmares, and pain in his arm, shoulder, and\nback. ( Id.) Plaintiff also states that Sergeant Ambrosino\n“failed to secure [the] area and separate” him from his\nattackers. (Reply at 5.) Plaintiff's claim against Warden Artuz\nis that he “fail [sic] to qualify as warden.” (Complaint at\n4.) Plaintiff names Commissioner Coombes as a defendant,\nalleging Coombes “fail [sic] to appoint a qualified warden\nover security.” (Amended Complaint at 5.) Plaintiff further\nalleges that Dr. Manion refused to give him pain medication.\n(Complaint at 5.) Plaintiff seeks to “prevent violent crimes”\nand demands $6,000,000 in damages. (Amended Complaint\nat 5.)\nDefendants moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that: (1)\nthe Eleventh Amendment bars suit against state defendants\nfor money damages; (2) the plaintiff's allegations fail to state\na claim for a constitutional violation; (3) the defendants are\nqualifiedly immune from damages; and (4) plaintiff must\nexhaust his administrative remedies before bringing this suit.\nDISCUSSION\nI find that plaintiff's complaint runs afoul of Rules 8  and\n10 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  and dismiss the\ncomplaint without prejudice and with leave to amend. Federal\nRule 8  requires that a complaint contain “a short and plain\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled\nto relief.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) . The purpose of this Rule\n“is to give fair notice of the claim being asserted so as to\npermit the adverse party the opportunity to file a responsiveCase 1:21-cv-00965-TJM-TWD   Document 5   Filed 10/12/21   Page 6 of 12Hudson v.

Marine\nMidland Bank,  162 F.R.D. 15, 16 (N.D.N.Y .1995)  (quoting\nBrown v. Califano,  75 F.R.D. 497, 498 (D.D.C.1977) );\nsee \n Salahuddin v. Cuomo,  861 F.2d 40, 42 (2d Cir.1988)\n(stating that the “principal function of pleadings under the\nFederal Rules is to give the adverse party fair notice of the\nclaim asserted so as to enable him to answer and prepare for\ntrial”).\n*2 Rule 10 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  requires,\ninter alia,  that the allegations in a plaintiff's complaint be\nmade in numbered paragraphs, each of which should recite,\nas far as practicable, only a single set of circumstances.\nMoore's Federal Practice,  V ol. 2A, ¶ 10.03 (1996). Rule\n10 also requires that each claim upon which plaintiff seeks\nrelief be founded upon a separate transaction or occurrence.\nId.2 The purpose of Rule 10 is to “provide an easy mode\nof identification for referring to a particular paragraph in a\nprior pleading.” Sandler v. Capanna,  92 Civ. 4838, 1992 WL\n392597, *3 (E.D.Pa. Dec.17, 1992)  (citing 5 C. Wright &\nA. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure,  § 1323 at 735\n(1990) ).\nA complaint that fails to comply with these pleading rules\n“presents far too heavy a burden in terms of defendants'\nduty to shape a comprehensive defense and provides no\nmeaningful basis for the Court to assess the sufficiency of” a\nplaintiff's claims. \n Gonzales v. Wing,  167 F.R.D. 352, 355\n(N.D.N.Y .1996) . It may therefore be dismissed by the court.\nId.; see also \n Salahuddin v. Cuomo,  861 F.2d at 42  (“When\na complaint does not comply with the requirement that it\nbe short and plain, the court has the power to, on its own\ninitiative, ... dismiss the complaint”). Dismissal, however, is\n“usually reserved for those cases in which the complaint is\nso confused, ambiguous, vague, or otherwise unintelligible\nthat its true substance, if any, is well disguised.” Id. In those\ncases in which the court dismisses a pro se  complaint for\nfailure to comply with Rule 8 , it should give the plaintiff leave\nto amend when the complaint states a claim that is on its\nface nonfrivolous. \n Simmons v. Abruzzo,  49 F.3d 83, 87 (2d\nCir.1995) .\nIn determining whether a nonfrivolous claim is stated, the\ncomplaint's allegations are taken as true, and the “complaint\nshould not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless\nit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set\nof facts in support of his claim which would entitle him torelief.” \n Conley v.. Gibson,  355 U.S. 41, 45–46, 78 S.Ct.\n99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) . The complaint of a pro se  litigant\nis to be liberally construed in his favor when determining\nwhether he has stated a meritorious claim. See \n Haines v.\nKerner,  404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652\n(1972) . Even if it is difficult to determine the actual substance\nof the plaintiff's complaint, outright dismissal without leave\nto amend the complaint is generally disfavored as an abuse\nof discretion. See \n Salahuddin,  861 F.2d at 42–42;  see also\nDoe v. City of New York,  No. 97 Civ. 420, 1997 WL 124214,\nat *2 (E.D.N.Y . Mar.12, 1997) .\nHere, plaintiff's pro se  complaint fails to satisfy the\nrequirements of Federal Rules 8  and 10. The complaint is\noften illegible and largely incomprehensible, scattering what\nappear to be allegations specific to plaintiff within a forest\nof headnotes copied from prior opinions. Defendants have\nanswered with a boilerplate brief, which is perhaps all a\ndefendant can do when faced with such a complaint. The\nCourt is left with an insurmountable burden in attempting to\nmake a reasoned ruling on such muddled pleadings.\n*3 Although plaintiff's complaint is substantially\nincomprehensible, it appears to plead at least some claims\nthat cannot be termed frivolous on their face. For example,\nplaintiff clearly alleges that inmates assaulted him and that\nDr. Manion refused to provide him medical attention. He also\nappears to assert that Sergeant Ambrosino failed to protect\nhim from the attack or take steps to prevent future attacks.\n(Plaintiff's Reply at 5). It is well established that an inmate's\nconstitutional rights are violated when prison officials act\nwith deliberate indifference to his safety or with intent to\ncause him harm. Hendricks v. Coughlin,  942 F.2d 109 (2d\nCir.1991) . It is similarly well established that an inmate's\nconstitutional rights are violated when a prison doctor denies\nhis request for medical care with deliberate indifference to\nthe inmate's serious medical needs. \n Estelle v. Gamble,  429\nU.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976) ; \nHathaway\nv. Coughlin,  37 F.3d 63 (2d Cir.1994) , cert. denied,  513 U.S.\n1154, 115 S.Ct. 1108, 130 L.Ed.2d 1074 (1995) . Although\nplaintiff provides few facts to support his allegations, I\ndisagree with defendants' assertion that outright dismissal is\nappropriate because it “appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff\ncan prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would\nentitle him to relief.” Defendant's Memorandum at 5 (quoting\nConley v.

Tierce , Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis,\nPhiladelphia, for defendant.\nMEMORANDUM\nPADOV A , District Judge.\n*1 Proceeding pro se,  plaintiff Saul Zalman Sandler initiated\nthis action against defendant Robert Capanna, Director\nof the Settlement Music School, alleging that Capanna\ndiscriminatorily failed to hire him because of his religion and\ngender. Capanna has moved to dismiss Sandler's complaint\nwith prejudice for the following reasons: (1) failure to\nstate a claim, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) ; (2) failure to set\nforth the complaint in separated and numbered paragraphs,\nFed.R.Civ.P. 10(b) ; (3) failure to set forth grounds for this\nCourt's jurisdiction, Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(1) ; and (4) lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) . Sandler has\nnot filed a response to Capanna's motion.1 For the following\nreasons, I will deny Capanna's motion but order Sandler to\namend his complaint.\nBACKGROUND\nThe following pertinent factual allegations can be found in or\ninferred from Sandler's complaint. As early as 1978, Sandler\nwas told by a dean of the faculty of the Settlement Music\nSchool (the “School”) that he was qualified to teach violin at\nthe School. In 1981, the School offered Sandler a part-time\nposition as a music teacher, which he was unable to accept due\nto other commitments. In 1986, Sandler applied for a positionas a violin teacher and was interviewed briefly without an\naudition by School director Capanna. Capanna did not offer\nSandler a position at the School at that time. Five years later,\nin 1991, Sandler reapplied to the School. For the stated reason\nthat he believed that Sandler was unable to communicate with\nchildren, Capanna again refused to hire Sandler.2 Sandler\nalleges that since 1991, none of the School's employees have\nbeen of male Jewish descent and that Capanna's decision\nnot to hire him was the result of “a definite predisposition\nof discrimination against male Jews ... by Capanna.” See\nComplaint.\nI. Motion to Dismiss Under Fed.R.Civ.P . 12(b)(6)\nCapanna first urges dismissal of Sandler's complaint pursuant\nto Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6)  for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief can be granted. In deciding such a motion, I must\nview all factual assertions in the complaint and all reasonable\ninferences drawn from them as true. See \n Kehr Packages,\nInc. v. Fidelcor, Inc.,  926 F.2d 1406, 1410 (3d Cir.) , cert.\ndenied,  111 S.Ct. 2839 (1991) . Only if Sandler's complaint\nalleges no set of facts upon which relief can be granted may\nI dismiss the complaint. See id.\nIn evaluating the adequacy of this particular complaint,\nhowever, I must keep two additional factors in mind.\nFirst, I must consider that Sandler is a pro se  litigant and\nthat complaints prepared by such litigants are subject to\nless stringent standards than complaints filed by licensed\nattorneys. See \n Haines v. Kerner,  404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972) ;\nUnited States v. Day,  969 F.2d 39, 42 (3d Cir.1992) .\nSecond, because the complaint appears to involve a civil\nrights claim in that Sandler complains of discrimination based\nupon his religion and gender, I must review the complaint to\nensure that it contains specific factual allegations in support\nof his claim for relief. See, e.g., \n Kauffman v. Moss,  420\nF.2d 1270, 1275–76 (3d Cir.1970) , cert. denied,  400 U.S. 846\n(1970) .\n*2 Capanna contends that Sandler's two page, narrative\ncomplaint fails to state a cause of action because it does not\nspecifically plead any recognized law upon which this court\ncould base relief from the alleged acts of discrimination. I\ndisagree. Sandler's complaint “need only state a set of facts\ngiving rise to a claim, and not the legal theory behind the\nclaim, so long as the defendant has enough information toCase 1:21-cv-00965-TJM-TWD   Document 5   Filed 10/12/21   Page 9 of 12Sandler v. Capanna, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1992)\n © 2021 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 2frame an answer and to commence discovery.” Barlow v.\nPep Boys, Inc.  625 F.Supp. 130, 132 (E.D.Pa.1985)  (citing\nMoorish Science Temple of America, Inc. v. Smith,  693\nF.2d 987, 989 (2d Cir.1982) ). I find that Sandler's complaint\narguably pleads sufficient factual allegations to state claims\nunder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n 42\nU.S.C.A. §§ 2000e et seq.  (West 1981) (“Title VII”), and/or\n42 U.S.C.A. § 1981 (West Supp.1992)  and that it provides\ndefendant with enough information to frame an answer and\nconduct discovery.\nTo state a claim under Title VII, Sandler must plead that (1)\nhe belongs to a class entitled to protection under Title VII and\n(2) in refusing to hire him, Capanna treated him differently\nfrom others similarly situated who were not members of\nthe protected class. See Barlow,  625 F.Supp. at 132  (citing\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,  411 U.S. 792, 802\n(1973) ). In his complaint, Sandler alleges that although the\nSchool had vacant positions for violin teachers and that\nhe was qualified to teach violin, Capanna refused to hire\nhim solely because he is a Jewish male. Discrimination in\nemployment based upon religion and gender are prohibited\nunder section 703(a) of Title VII, \n 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a) .\nI therefore conclude that Sandler's complaint states a cause of\naction under Title VII.\nSandler's complaint also states a cause of action under\n42 U.S.C.A. § 1981 , which “prohibits intentional racial\ndiscrimination in making and enforcing contracts and in\nsecuring ‘equal benefits of all laws and proceedings.’ ”\nBarlow,  625 F.Supp. at 133  (quoting \n 42 U.S.C. § 1981 ).\nIn addition to the elements required to state a cause of\naction under Title VII, discriminatory intent  must be alleged\nto state a cause of action under \n section 1981 . See\nCroker v. Boeing Co. (Vertol Div.),  662 F.2d 975, 989 (3d\nCir.1981) . Averments that Capanna's discriminatory conduct\nwas “willful and intentional” and that none of the School's\nemployees as of November 1991 were males of Jewish\ndescent satisfy this requirement. See Complaint.\nSandler's complaint also provides sufficient information from\nwhich Capanna can frame an answer and conduct discovery.\nIn addition to the foregoing analysis demonstrating that\nSandler's complaint states causes of action under the Title\nVII and \n section 1981 , I also note that attached to hiscomplaint is a “Notice of Right to Sue” form from the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”). This form\nindicates that Sandler has filed with the EEOC a charge under\nTitle VII and that the EEOC will not process the charge any\nfurther. I find that the factual allegations in the complaint,\nread in conjunction with the legal inferences fairly drawn\nfrom this form, provide Capanna with sufficient information\nwith which to frame an answer and conduct discovery. At a\nminimum, these two documents indicate that Sandler's claim\nis more than likely based upon Title VII. It is not too much\nto conclude that \n section 1981  is also implicated. Finally,\nbecause I do agree that there is some ambiguity, I will require\nSandler to amend his complaint to state specifically the legal\ntheories upon which he bases his right to recovery.  As this\nambiguity can be easily cured by amendment, I find that\ndismissal would be unduly harsh, and I will accordingly deny\nCapanna's motion on this ground.\n*3 As an alternative ground for dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P.\n12(b)(6) , Capanna argues that Sandler failed to aver that\nhe exhausted his administrative remedies before filing the\ninstant action. Under Title VII, a plaintiff must file a charge\nwith the EEOC or, in Pennsylvania, with the Pennsylvania\nHuman Relations Commission (“PHRC”), before bringing\nsuit in federal court. See \n Trevino–Barton v. Pittsburgh\nNat'l Bank,  919 F.2d 874, 878 (3d Cir.1990) . If a charge\nfiled with the EEOC or PHRC is dismissed, or the agency\nhas not filed an action within 180 days of the filing of\nthe charge, administrative remedies are deemed exhausted\nand the plaintiff may file suit in federal court. See \n42\nU.S.C.A. § 2000e–5(f) . Sandler attached to his complaint a\n“Notice of Right to Sue” form from the EEOC, stating that\nthe EEOC was terminating further processing of a charge\nfiled by Sandler with the Commission more than 180 days\nearlier. Although the form does not expressly state the factual\nallegations involved in the charge or against whom the charge\nwas made, I note that it does contain a notation that a copy\nwas sent to the Settlement Music School. Viewed in the\nlight most favorable to Sandler, I will infer that the charge\nreferred to in the form involved the occurrence complained\nof in Sandler's complaint. Accordingly, I find that Sandler's\ncomplaint contains sufficient information with which to\nindicate that he has exhausted his administrative remedies.\nI will therefore deny Capanna's motion to dismiss Sandler's\ncomplaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) .Case 1:21-cv-00965-TJM-TWD   Document 5   Filed 10/12/21   Page 10 of 12Sandler v. Capanna, Not Reported in F.Supp. (1992)\n © 2021 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 3II. Motion to Dismiss Under Fed.R.Civ.P . 10(b)\nCapanna also requests that I dismiss Sandler's complaint\nfor failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 10(b) . Rule 10(b)\nprovides that “all averments of a claim or defense shall be\nmade in numbered paragraphs....” The purpose behind this\nRule 10(b)  is to “provide an easy mode of identification\nfor referring to a particular paragraph in a prior pleading or\nfor cross-referencing within a single pleading.” 5 Charles A.\nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure:\nCivil § 1323 at 735 (1990) . Capanna argues that Sandler's\ncomplaint violates this rule because it is essentially a narrative\ndocument comprised of two unnumbered paragraphs. I agree\nwith Capanna that, as written, the complaint does not provide\ndefendant with a reasonable mode of reference for future\npleadings. I will therefore order that Sandler amend his\ncomplaint to place each allegation into a separate paragraph\npursuant to Rule 10(b) . As Sandler is proceeding pro se,\nhowever, I will not dismiss his complaint for this reason.\nIII. Motion to Dismiss Under Fed.R.Civ.P . 8(a)(1)\nCapanna next contends that Sandler's complaint should\nbe dismissed for failure to satisfy the requirements of\nFed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(1) . Rule 8(a)(1)  requires that complaints\ncontain a “short and plain statement of the grounds upon\nwhich the court's jurisdiction depends.” This jurisdictional\nprerequisite, however, is satisfied where the party seeking\nfederal jurisdiction asserts a substantive claim under a\nfederal statute. See Chasis v. Progress Mfg. Co.,  382 F.2d\n773, 776 (3d Cir.1967) . As I discussed above, Sandler has\narguably asserted substantive claims under Title VII and\n42 U.S.C.A. § 1981 . Therefore, I find that Sandler's\ncomplaint meets the intent of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(1)  and will\ndeny Capanna's motion to dismiss based upon this ground.\nIV . Motion to Dismiss Under Fed.R.Civ.P . 12(b)(1)\n*4 Lastly, Capanna seeks to dismiss the complaint for lack\nof subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1). To grant a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) , I must\nfind that the complaint is legally insufficient. See \n Kehr,\n926 F.2d at 1408 . Capanna argues that Sandler's complaint is\nlegally insufficient because Sandler failed to plead any federal\nlaw upon which this Court could base its jurisdiction. I reject\nCapanna's argument. As discussed above, Sandler arguably\nasserts claims under Title VII and \n 42 U.S.C. § 1981 . The\njurisdiction of this court is, therefore, proper because a federal\nquestion has been raised. See 28 U.S.C. § 1331 . Accordingly,\nI will deny Capanna's motion to dismiss the complaint for\nfailure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) .\nAn appropriate order follows.\nORDER\nAND NOW, this 9th day of December, 1992, upon\nconsideration of defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint\n(Docket No. 2) and all papers filed in support thereof, it is\nhereby ORDERED that:\n1. Defendant's motion to dismiss is DENIED for the reasons\nstated in the accompanying Memorandum.\n2. Within twenty (20) days from the date of this Order,\nplaintiff shall file with the Clerk of Court and serve upon\nopposing counsel an amended complaint in accordance with\nthe accompanying Memorandum. Specifically, plaintiff shall:\n(a) state with particularity each and every legal theory upon\nwhich his claim for relief is based and (b) reorganize his\ncomplaint so that each and every factual and legal allegation\nare set forth in separate, numbered paragraphs.\n3.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Veronica Casolare filed a lawsuit against the County of Onondaga, its Sheriff's Department, and several officers alleging gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation. The court denied the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the hostile work environment claim, allowing it to proceed, but granted summary judgment on the quid pro quo sexual harassment, retaliation claims, and dismissed some other claims. This case does not involve AI, machine learning, or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the alleged conduct by a supervisor constituted sexual harassment creating a hostile work environment, and whether the defendants can be held liable under Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause for these actions.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff presented enough evidence to support her claim of a hostile work environment due to sexual harassment, thus denying summary judgment on that issue, although the court granted summary judgment on other claims such as quid pro quo harassment and retaliation. The court also granted qualified immunity to certain named individuals.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Veronica Casolare said that people at her work were making her feel very uncomfortable with rude and inappropriate comments because she was a woman. She believed her bosses did not do enough to help, so she sued them. The court decided she might have a real complaint about the uncomfortable work environment but tossed out her claims about other issues and agreed that some of her bosses shouldn't be personally blamed.",

MUNSON\nSenior United States District Judge\nMEMORANDUM - DECISION AND ORDER\nINTRODUCTION\nPlaintiff, Veronica Casolare, filed a complaint claiming gender-based discrimination and\nharassment as well as retaliation.  Plaintiff work ed for the Onondaga County Sheriff’s Department\nas a Deputy Sheriff at the Onondaga County Justice Ce nter (“Justice Center”).  Plaintiff claims that\nher supervisors subjected her to  pervasive and severe sexual harassment, which created a hostile\nwork environment, and retaliated against her after she had brought the harassment to hersupervisors’ attention and filed related claims.  Plaintiff filed suit against Defendants, the County\nof Onondaga, New York (“the County), the Ononda ga County Sheriff’s Department (“Sheriff’s\nDepartment”), Onondaga County Sh eriff Kevin Walsh, and Captains Laurence Albanese and\nThomas Galka, in their official and indi vidual capacities (“Moving Defendants”), who deny\nPlaintiff’s claims and move for summary judgment\n1 pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure as well as Sergeant Benjamin O’Dell2 in his official and individual capacity.  For the\nfollowing reasons, the Court DENIES the Moving Defendants’ motion for summary judgment with\nrespect to Plaintiff’s hostile work environment claims and GRANTS the Moving Defendants’motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff’s quid pro quo sexual harassment and\nretaliation claims and the assertion of the qualified immunity defense and GRANTS in part andDENIES in part the Moving Defe ndants’ motion for summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff’sCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 2 of 283equal protection claims.\nBACKGROUND\nI. Plaintiff’s Complaint\nPlaintiff brings her complaint pursuant to Title VII of the Civ il Rights Act of 1964, as\namended, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a), the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and New York Ex ecutive Law § 290, claiming discrimination and\nharassment based upon her gender and retaliation.  Specifically, Plaintiff brings five causes of\naction, asserting that: (1) O’Dell’s actions created a hostile work environment in violation of Title\nVII; (2) Defendants subjected her to quid pro quo sexual harassment whereby, as a result of her\nrejection of O’Dell’s sexual propositions, O’Dell threatened her and Defendants denied her a\npromotion for which she was qualified in violation of Title VII; (3) Defendants retaliated against\nher after she complained of the harassment to her supervisors and filed sexual discrimination charges\nwith the New York State Division of Huma n Rights and the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission in violation of Title VII; (4) Defendants discriminated against her, in the terms andconditions of her employment, because she is a wo man in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\nand 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and, (5) Defe ndants discriminated against her, in the terms and conditions of\nher employment, because of her gender in viol ation of New York Human Rights Law (“NYHRL”).\nSee Dkt. No. 1, Compl. at ¶¶ 34-55. \nTo allay the alleged discrimination, harassmen t and resulting emotional and mental stress,\nPlaintiff seeks: (1) an award of damages in  an amount not less than $1,000,000 for lost wages,\nbenefits, and promotional opportunities, including an  award of front pay co mpensating plaintiff for\nloss of future salary and bene fits; (2) an award of damages in an amount not less than $1,000,000\nfor mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, and emotional injury; (3) an order enjoiningdefendants from engaging in sexual discriminati on, sexual harassment and retaliation; and, (4) anCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 3 of 284award of reasonable attorney’s fees and the costs of her action.  See Dkt. No. 1, Compl.\nII. Facts\nOnondaga County is a municipal corporation duly incorporated pursuant to the laws of the\nState of New York.  The Onondaga County Sheri ff’s Department is a municipal department of\nOnondaga County.  Dkt. No. 19, Defs.’ Statement of Ma terial Facts at ¶ 1.  Sh eriff Walsh is the duly\nelected Sheriff of the County and is the head of the Sheriff’s Department.  Id.  at ¶ 2.  Captains\nAlbanese and Galka are both members of the Sher iff’s Department’s Cust ody Division.  Dkt. No.\n19, Defs.’ Statement of Material Facts at ¶ 3.  O’Dell is a former Sergeant of the Sheriff’sDepartment’s Custody Division.  Id.\n at ¶ 4.  The County has employe d Plaintiff since approximately\nAugust 29, 1994, as a Deputy Sheriff at  the Public Safety Building and at the Justice Center within\nthe Custody Division.  Plaintiff was employed on a probationary basis until October 26, 1995, at\nwhich time she became a permanent employee.  Id.  at ¶ 6.  At the time of the filing of this motion,\nPlaintiff was employed full-time as a Deputy Sheri ff in the Custody Division at the Justice Center.\nId. at ¶ 7.  \nThe parties dispute whether the County has wr itten policies and procedures outlining specific\nsteps for filing a complaint for harassment and disc rimination.  The parties also dispute whether the\nCounty Employee Handbook contains the policy prohi biting sexual, racial and national origin\nharassment, defining such harassment and inviting aggrieved employees to utilize the DiscriminationGrievance Procedure.  The parties additionally dispute whether the County has Procedures for\nProcessing Employee Harassment and Discrimination Complaints.  Similarly, the parties disputewhether County’s Executive Orders affirming its support and commitment to barring discriminationfrom the workplace dated July 28, 1994, and update d on March 5, 2001, were applicable to the\nSheriff’s Department.  Compare  Id.\n at ¶¶ 8-11 with Dkt. No. 22, Pl.’s Statement of Material Facts\nat ¶¶ 7-10.  The disputes, however, are born of discovery, which the Court addresses below.  Case 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 4 of 285The Sheriff’s Department Policy Directive w ith an effective date of October 31, 1995, and\nupdated on August 11, 1998, sets forth policy prohib iting harassment and discrimination, including\nsexual harassment in the workplace, defines the pr ohibited conduct and provides the procedures for\nresolving incidents of harassment and discrimination.  Dkt. No. 19, Defs.’ Statement of MaterialFacts at ¶ 12.  Plaintiff adds, however, that the Polic y Directive was not in effect during the first six-\nand-a-half months she worked at the Justice Ce nter and during which time O’Dell allegedly harassed\nher.  Dkt. No. 22, Pl.’s Statement of Material F acts at ¶ 11.  Plaintiff received sexual harassment\ntraining while at the police academy in 1994 as well as “refresher” training sessions.  Dkt. No. 19,\nDefs.’ Statement of Material Facts at ¶ 13.  The parties dispute whether Plaintiff availed herself of\nthe process to file a complaint of harassment or discrimination on her own behalf.  Plaintiff contends\nthat she complained about O’Dell’s alleged harassment to Sergeants Ligoci and Cogan.  Compare\nid.\n at ¶ 14 with Dkt. No. 22, Pl.’s Statement of Material Facts at ¶ 13.  \nThe Sheriff’s Department suspended O’Dell fr om work on or about November 1, 1996, based\nupon complaints of sexual harassment by another Justice Center female employee.  During thecourse of the subsequent investigation by the Sheriff Department’s Professional Standards Unit,Plaintiff provided information regarding her own complaints of sexual harassment by O’Dell.  Dkt.\nNo. 19, Defs.’ Statement of Materi al Facts at ¶ 15.  Plaintiff contends that O’Dell began to harass\nher because of her gender on or about April 1995 a nd that such harassment continued until the time\nof O’Dell’s suspension.  O’Dell’s alleged harassment consisted of sexually explicit and/orderogatory comments made in front of Plaintiff a nd/or her co-workers and other supervisors “on a\nvirtually daily basis.”  Dkt. No. 22, Pl.’s Statemen t of Material Facts at ¶ 27(k).  Plaintiff submits\nnumerous examples of O’Dell’s alleged harassment,  including: (1) O’Dell commented to Plaintiff\nin front of other deputies and supervisors, “so, I hear you’re doing Geruso”; (2) O’Dell askedPlaintiff if she had seen his girlfriend at a part y.  When Plaintiff said “no,” O’Dell responded thatCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 5 of 286his girlfriend was black and the black girls were bette r sexually than white girls; (3)  while Plaintiff\nbent over to get a folder out of a cabinet at work, O’Dell referred to security cameras and said to her,\n“on camera it looks like you’re giving me a blow job”; (4) O’Dell told Plaintiff on three occasions,at least once in front of co-workers, Dkt. No.21, Defs.’ Ex. G., that “as long as I have a face, you\nhave a place to sit”; (5) O’Dell told Plaintiff,  “I had a dream about you and you would do anything\nI wanted, anything.”  Plaintiff re sponded that “it was a dream,” and O’Dell countered that she was\n“such a tight ass”; (6) O’Dell sexually propositione d Plaintiff on numerous occasions, and when she\nreplied that he had a wife and girlfriend, he said he would give them up for her; (7) O’Dell made a\nhand gesture suggesting that they have sexual inte rcourse; (8) O’Dell referred to Plaintiff as a dumb\nblonde, a stupid blonde or an “artificial blonde w ith artificial intelligence”;  (9) in Plaintiff’s\npresence, O’Dell told several male supervisors and deputies that he had better sex with his girlfriend,\nwho was a nurse at the jail, when she removed he r teeth; (10) O’Dell made an unspecified sexually\nderogatory comment about Plaintiff while they we re both in the presence of Sergeant Randolph; and\n(11) O’Dell threatened that “he could do anythi ng with her, put her anywhere he wanted to,\nincluding where she didn’t want to go,” and by te lling Plaintiff and Deputy Spaulding that “they\ndidn’t realize how strong he was and [how] many friends he had a nd how powerful he was.”  Dkt.\nNo. 22, Pl.’s Statement of Material Facts at ¶ 27(a)-(j), (l).    \nFollowing Plaintiff’s complaint against O’Dell,  Plaintiff was immedi ately transferred from\n“C” Watch to “A” Watch in order to avoid contact with O’Dell and was directed to bypass thestandard chain of command and report any other comp laints or concerns directly to Deputy Chief\nWall.  Dkt. No. 19, Defs.’ Statement of Mate rial Facts at ¶ 16.  On May 17, 1997, the Sheriff’s\nDepartment served O’Dell with disciplinary charges based upon allegations that he sexuallyharassed Plaintiff and two other females.  Followi ng a due process hearing, the Sheriff’s Department\nterminated O’Dell’s employment effective Sept ember 8, 1997.  Dkt.

On or about April 28, 1997, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with\nthe New York State Division of Human Rights agai nst the Sheriff’s Department and O’Dell alleging\nthat the Sheriff’s Department engaged in an “unlawful discriminatory practice relating toEmployment, because of Sex.”  Dkt. No. 21, Ex. J.  The Division of Human Rights dismissedPlaintiff’s complaint on the basis of administrative convenience.    Dkt. N o. 19, Defs.’ Statement of\nMaterial Facts at ¶ 18.    \nThe Moving Defendants seek summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules\nof Civil Procedure.  In support of their motion, they contend: (1) that although O’Dell’s behaviorwas admittedly obnoxious, such behavior did not cr eate a hostile work environment; (2) Plaintiff’s\nclaims fail to establish a cause of action for either quid pro quo sexual harassment or retaliation; and,\n(3) that the individually named County De fendants are entitled to  qualified immunity.\n3  See\ngenerally Dkt. No. 18, Defs.’ Mem. of Law.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Discovery\nAs an initial matter, the Court addresses a discovery issue having some bearing on its\nconsideration of the instant motion.  On Augus t 16, 2001, Plaintiff submitted her first demand for\nthe production of documents, requesting, inter alia , that Defendants produce “the sexual harassment\npolicy in effect for the County of Onondaga a nd/or the Onondaga County Sheriff’s Department\nduring the years 1994 through 1997.”  See Dkt. No. 23, Ex. D at ¶ 3.  In response to Plaintiff’s\ndemand, Defendants produced the following: the O nondaga Sheriff’s Department Custody Division\nPolicy Directive of October 31, 1995, and an Ononda ga County Sheriff’s Office Written Directive\nof August 11, 1998, which update d the prior directive.  See Dkt. No. 23, Ex. E at ¶ 3, F and G.Case 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 7 of 284Plaintiff notes her intention to make a motion in limine  to preclude Defendants from using these policies at\ntrial.\n8Plaintiff alleges that Defendants never supplemen ted their response to her demand to produce the\nsexual harassment policy in effect in Onondaga  County and/or the Sheriff’s Department.  \nIn their motion for summary judgment, however , Defendants refer not only to the two above\nreferenced policies, but also to the Ononda ga County Employees Handbook, a County of Onondaga\nProcedures for Processing Employee Harassment & Discrimination Complaints, and an Executive\nOrder Regarding Sexual, Racial, National and General Harassment in the Workplace, whichDefendants submitted as exhibits.  See Dkt. Nos. 19 and 21.  Plainti ff asserts that Defendants failed\nto produce these additional sexual harassment po licies during discovery.  Defendants’ counsel\nrepresents in her affidavit that all exhibits submitted in support of Defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment are “true and accurate copies of documents which were exchanged and/or disclosed in thecourse of pretrial discovery.”  Dkt. No. 17, Doughert y Aff. at ¶ 4.   At or al argument, however, she\ncandidly acknowledged that while she produced what she had available to her during discovery, she\nsubsequently uncovered additional County sexual harassment policy materials and did not update\nher discovery to include the policies in question b ecause “it would have been far after discovery was\nclosed.”  Dkt. No. 27, Tr. at 16-17.  \nIt is clear that the additional sexual harassment policies were in effect between 1994 and\n1997, but without the additional policie s, Plaintiff would not have been able to examine Defendants\nregarding those policies.  Plaintiff, therefore re quests that the Court disregard those policies in its\nconsideration of the instant motion.\n4  Consequently, for purposes of  this summary judgment motion,\nthe Court will not consider the three additional po licies with the expectation that should Plaintiff\nbring a motion in limine , as she has indicated she will do, to  preclude Defendants from introducing\nthese policies at trial, both parties will have an opportunity to more fully address the matter.Case 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 8 of 289II. Summary Judgment Standard\nThe standard for summary judgment is fam iliar and well-settled.  Rule 56 allows for\nsummary judgment where the evidence demonstrates th at “there is no genuine issue of any material\nfact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2510, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986) .  Summary judgment is\nproperly regarded as an integral part of the Fede ral Rules as a whole, which are designed “to secure\nthe just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.”  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S.\n317, 326, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L.E d.2d 265 (1991) (quoting F ED.R.C IV.P. 1).  A court may\ngrant a motion for summary judgment when the movi ng party carries its burden of showing that no\ntriable issues of fact exist.  See Thompson v. Gjivoje , 896 F.2d 716, 720 (2d Cir .1990).  In light of\nthis burden, any inferences to be drawn from the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable\nto the non-moving party.  See id.; United States v. Diebold, Inc. , 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993,\n994, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962) (per curi am).  If the moving party meets its burden, the burden shifts\nto the non-moving party to come forward with “speci fic facts showing that there is a genuine issue\nfor trial.”  F ED.R.C IV.P. 56(e).  The role of the court on a motion for summary judgment is not to\ntry issues of fact but only to determine whet her there are issues of fact to be tried. See, e.g.,\nAnderson , 477 U.S. at 255, 106 S.Ct. at 2513; Gallo v. Prudential Residential Services, Limited\nPartnership , 22 F.3d 1219, 1223-24 (2d Cir.1994); Donahue v. Windsor Locks Board of Fire\nCommissioners , 834 F.2d 54, 58 (2d Cir.1987).  The drawing of inferences and the assessment of\nthe credibility of the witnesses remain within the pr ovince of the finders of fact.  To defeat a motion\nfor summary judgment, however, the non-moving party “must do more than simply show that thereis some metaphysical doubt as to the material fact s.”  Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio\nCorp. , 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed. 2d 538 (1986).  A dispute regarding a material\nfact is genuine “if evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movingCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 9 of 285New York courts require the same standard of proof for claims brought under the NYHRL as those brought\nunder Title VII; therefore, claims under the NYHRL and under Title VII are essentially identical.  See Tomka v. Seiler ,\n66 F.3d 1295, 1304 n.4 (2d Cir. 1995) (citing Miller Br ewing Co. v. State Div. of Human Rights , 66 N.Y.2d 937, 498\nN.Y.S.2d 776, 489 N.E.2d 745 (1985))); see also  Stetson v. NYNEX Serv. Co. , 995 F.2d 355, 360 (2d Cir. 1993)\n(Plaintiff’s claim under NYHRL “is governed by the same sta ndards as his federal claim”).  By examining the\napplicable standard for Title VII claims, the Cour t coincidentally addresses Plaintiff’s NYHRL claims. \n6New York law differs from federal law, however, in one  significant respect: New York allows for liability of\nindividual defendants on the basis of a hostile work envir onment claim.  The Second Circuit has concluded that “a\ndefendant who actually participates in the conduct giving rise  to a discrimination claim may be held personally liable”\nunder the NYSHRL. Tomka , 66 F.3d at 1313.  \n10party.”  Anderson , 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S. Ct. at 2510.   Wh en reasonable minds could not differ as\nto the import of the evidence, then  summary judgment  is proper.   See Anderson , 477 U.S. at\n250-251, 106 S.Ct. at 2511.\nIII. Plaintiff’s Title VII and NYHRL Claims5\nIn her first cause of action, Plaintiff asserts that O’Dell subjected her to a continuous barrage\nof sexually derogatory and demeaning st atements on a virtually daily basis.  See Dkt. No. 1, Compl.\nat ¶ 35.  Title VII provides, in relevant part, th at “[i]t shall be unlawfu l for an employer . . . to\ndiscriminate against any individual with respect to  his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\nof employment, because of the individual’s . . . sex . . . .”  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).  Before\nproceeding further, the Court notes that it is well-settled that Congress did not intend to hold\nindividuals liable in their individual capacity under Title VII.6  See Tomka , 66 F.3d at 1313-17.\nTherefore, Plaintiff’s claims against Sheriff Walsh, Captains Albanese and Galka, and former\nSergeant O’Dell in their individual capacities, pursuant to Title VII are dismissed with prejudice.Plaintiff’s NYHRL claims against Sheriff Walsh, Ca ptains Albanese and Galka and former Sergeant\nO’Dell in their personal capacities are left undisturbed.  \nUnder Title VII, courts have traditionally  recognized two forms of sexual harassment:\n“hostile work environment” harassment and “ quid pro quo ” harassment.  See, e.g. , Leibovitz v. New\nYork City Transit Auth. , 252 F.3d 179, 188 (2d Cir. 2001).  Alt hough Title VII does not include theCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 10 of 2811terms “ quid pro quo ” and “hostile work environment” within its text, they are useful to distinguish\nbetween “‘cases involving a threat which is carried  out and offensive conduct in general.’”  Mormol\nv. Costco Wholesale Corp. , 364 F.3d 54, 57 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Burlington Indus., Inc. v.\nEllerth , 524 U.S. 742, 753, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998)). \nA. Hostile Work Environment\nTitle VII encompasses the entire spectrum of “disparate treatment . . . , which includes\nrequiring people to work in a discriminatorily hos tile or abusive environment.”  Harris v. Forklift\nSystems, Inc. , 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993).  A hostile work\nenvironment is one in which “the workplace is perm eated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule,\nand insult, that is sufficiently severe or pe rvasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s\nemployment.”  Id.   \n[H]arms suffered in the workplace are c ognizable under Title VII, even when they\nare not the result of “tangible employment actions,” if they arise from conduct (1)\nthat is “objectively” severe or pervasive–th at is, if it creates “an environment that a\nreasonable person would find hostile or abus ive” [the “objective” requirement], (2)\nthat the plaintiff “subjectively perceives” as hostile or abusive [the “subjective”requirement], and (3) that creates such an environment because of plaintiff’s sex (or\nother characteristic protected by Title VII) [the “prohibited causal factor”requirement].  \nGregory v. Daly\n, 243 F.3d 687, 692 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).  Determining whether\nthe workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimida tion that is severe or pervasive so as to alter\nthe conditions of the victim’s employment requires an evaluation of all the circumstances, which\nmay include “the frequency of the discriminato ry conduct; its severity; whether it is physically\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interfereswith the employee’s work performance.”  Harris\n, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371.  It is important\nto note, however, that Title VII is not “a gene ral civility code,”  Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore\nServs., Inc. , 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 ( 1998), and “[s]imple teasing, offhandCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 11 of 2812comments, or isolated incidents of offensive conduct (unless extremely serious) will not support a\nclaim of discriminatory harassment.”  Petrosino v. Bell Atlantic , 385 F.3d 210, 223 (2d Cir. 2004).\nAs to the frequency, “[t]here is no fixed number of incidents that a plaintiff must endure in order to\nestablish a hostile work environment.”  Alfano v. Costello , 294 F.3d 365, 379 (2d Cir. 2002).  The\nalleged incidents “must be more than episodic; they must be sufficiently continuous and concertedin order to be pervasive.”  Carrero v. New York City Housing Auth.\n, 890 F.2d 569, 577 (2d Cir.\n1989); Tomka , 66 F.3d at 1305 n.5 (citations omitted)  (“[T ]he incidents must occur in concert or\nwith a regularity that can reasonably be termed pervasive.”); Kotcher v. Rosa and Sullivan\nAppliance Ctr., Inc. , 957 F.2d 59, 62 (2d Cir. 1992) (“The incidents must be repeated and\ncontinuous; isolated acts or occasional episodes w ill not merit relief.”).  Additionally, the employee\nmust subjectively perceive the e nvironment to be hostile, and the environment must be one that a\nreasonable person would find hostile or abusive.  Torres v. Pisano , 116 F.3d 625, 632 (2d Cir. 1997).\n Finally, “[t]he effect [of the harassment] on the employee’s psychological well-being is, of course,\nrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive.  But whilepsychological harm, like any other relevant factor , may be taken into account, no single factor is\nrequired.”  Harris\n, 510 U.S. at 23, 114 S.Ct. at 371.  Although actionable harassment is not confined\nto sexual advances or other explicitly sexual conduct, “the plaintiff is required to establish that the\nharassment complained of was based on her gender.” Galdieri-Ambrosini v. Nat’l Realty & Dev.\nCorp. , 136 F.3d 276, 289 (2d Cir. 1998) (citations omitted).\nThe Court finds O’Dell’s remarks rather crude and obnoxious–a point that Defendants\nwillingly concede, Dkt. No. 18, Defs.’ Mem. of Law at 5–and examining the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to Plaintiff, the Court cannot say, as a matter of law, that  no reasonable jury would\nfind that a hostile work environment existed.  There can be little doubt that O’Dell’s comments werebased upon Plaintiff’s gender.  The instances of harassment articulated by Plaintiff are more thanCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 12 of 2813single, isolated examples of verbal abuse.  Not only did Plaintiff allege at least thirteen specific\nincidents with sexually charged remarks and/or incidents over the course of an approximatelynineteen month period, but she al so asserted that O’Dell’s harassment of her occurred, “on a\nvirtually daily basis.”  While the alleged o ffensive language and sexual gestures were not\naccompanied by any allegations of physical harm, a plaintiff need not endure threats of physical\nharm to sustain a hostile work environment claim.  See Richardson\n, 180 F.3d at 440.  The Court also\nnotes, however, that despite Plaintiff’s apparent  indignation with O’Dell’s behavior, she managed\nto go out for coffee at a local restaurant with co lleagues, including O’Dell, as often as they could\nup until October 16, 1996, when she filed charges agai nst him.  Dkt. No. 21, Ex. Q, Casolare Dep.\nat 176-79.  \nAlthough a close issue, in view of all the circ umstances, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s\nhostile work environment claims are sufficient to withstand summary judgment.  Were a reasonable\njury to credit Plaintiff’s vers ion of the case, it could find that O’Dell crossed the admittedly\nindistinct line between “boorish and inappropriate” behavior and actionable sexual harassment.Holtz v. Rockefeller & Co., Inc.\n, 258 F.3d 62 (2d Cir. 2001); compare  Alfano , 294 F.3d at 378-380\n(collecting cases and finding that five incidents, three of which amounted to different iterations of\na single sexual prank, over a four-year period, were too few, too separate in time and too mild tosustain a hostile work environment claim); Quinn\n, 159 F.3d 768 (finding an appreciative comment\nabout the plaintiff’s buttocks and a deliberate touchi ng of her breasts insufficient as a matter of law\nto alter the terms and conditions of employment); and Moore v. Transitional Servs., Inc. , 1998 WL\n71824 at *4 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (finding that a reference to plaintiff as a “fat bitch” and the act ofslamming a door in her face  fell “w ell short of demonstrating the sort of pervasive, severe conduct\nthat would alter the conditions of her employment and give rise to a claim of hostile workplacesexual harassment”) with Holtz\n, 258 F.3d 62, 75-76 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding a triable issue whereCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 13 of 2814during more than one year of employment, the plaintiff’s harasser touched her hand on a “daily\nbasis,” made “obscene leers at her,” “tried to peer down her blouse and up her skirt,” and made“approximately ten or twenty” insinuating remarks about her sex life); Daly\n, 243 F.3d at 692-93\n(holding that allegations that male supervis or made demeaning comments about women, made\nsexually demeaning statements, initiated unwelcome physical conduct of a sexual nature, intimidatedplaintiff by standing “uncomfortably close,” and made references to women as easy victims of\nsexual assault stated a claim for hostile work environment sexual harassment under Title VII);Raniola v. Bratton\n, 243 F.3d 610, 621 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding a triable issue where plaintiff\ndemonstrated that in two and a half years, she was subjected to offensive sex-based remarks,disproportionately burdensome work assignments, workplace sabotage and one serious threat ofphysical harm); Howley v. Stratford\n, 217 F.3d 141 (2d Cir. 2000) (reversing summary judgment\nwhere harasser launched a single lengthy and humiliati ng tirade in which the plaintiff was the only\nfemale present and many of the men were her subordinates); Schwapp v. Town of Avon , 118 F.3d\n106 (2d Cir. 1997) (holding that the plaintiff had created a triable issue based on ten to twelve\ninstances of explicitly racist conduct in twenty m onths, where most of the incidents involved racial\njokes and epithets that insulted blacks, Puerto Ri cans, and people of Middle Eastern origin); and\nPisano , 116 F.3d at 628-33 (finding the existence of a hostile work environment where plaintiff’s\nsupervisor “repeatedly referred to her as a ‘dum b cunt,’ suggested that she was in the habit of\nperforming oral sex for money, ridiculed her pr egnancy, commented on her anatomy and his desire\nto have sex with her, and allowed friends of his who visited him at the office to make crude sexual\nremarks about her”). \nPlaintiff must also show that “a specific basis exists for imputing the conduct that created\nthe hostile environment to the employer.”  Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc. , 115 F.3d 143, 149 (2d\nCir.1997).  The Supreme Court has held that an em ployer is presumed absolutely liable in casesCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 14 of 2815where the harassment is perpetrated by a supervisor with immediate or successively higher authority\nover the victim, although employers may interpose an affirmative defense to rebut that presumption.\nWhen no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an\naffirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance ofthe evidence, see F\nED.R.C IV.PROC. 8(c).  The defense comprises two necessary\nelements: (a) that the employer exercise d reasonable care to prevent and correct\npromptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employeeunreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities\nprovided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. \nBurlington\n, 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270.  When the source of the alleged harassment is a\nco-worker, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer “‘failed to provide a reasonable avenue\nfor complaint or if it knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, about theharassment yet failed to take appropriate remedial action.’”  Richardson v. New York State\nDepartment of Correctional Service , 180 F.3d at 441 (quoting Kracunas v. Iona College , 119 F.3d\n80, 89 (2d Cir.1997)).\nThe parties dispute whether O’Dell was in fact Plaintiff’s supervisor.  The Moving\nDefendants concede that because O’Dell held the rank of sergeant, he was a superior officer toPlaintiff, but they submit that he  was not Plaintiff’s direct superv isor.  Dkt. No. 18, Defs.’ Mem. of\nLaw at 7.  Plaintiff directs the Court’s attention to Sheriff Walsh’s charges against O’Dell, which\nstate that “while assigned as a Supervisor at the Justice Center you made inappropriate,unprofessional and harassing remarks to a female subordinate .”  Dkt. No. 21, Defs.’ Ex. I (emphasis\nadded).  The language in the charge strongly suggest s that O’Dell was Plaintiff’s supervisor in some\ncapacity, and the Court will proceed accordingly.    \nThe Moving Defendants assert the Burlington\n affirmative defense arguing that they took\nreasonable care to prevent and promptly correct any harassment by O’Dell.  Defendants submit that\nthey immediately responded to Plain tiff’s formal complaint and granted her request to be transferred\nto “A” Watch the same day.  The municipal Defendants immediately suspended O’Dell, andCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 15 of 2816following a due process hearing, terminated his empl oyment.  In addition, Plaintiff was advised that\nshe would report any other work-related concerns directly to Deputy Chief Wall, thus bypassing the\nordinary chain of command.  The Moving Defendants also point to their anti-sexual harassmentpolicy.  Dkt. No. 18, Defs.’ Mem. of Law at 7.  Plaintiff counter s that the Moving Defendants did\nnot exercise reasonable care to prevent and rectify the alleged harassment.  Plaintiff argues that she\nhad reasonable fear of reporting the harassment during the probationary period of her employment,\nand that when she did complain of the harassment,  her complaints fell upon deaf ears.  Dkt. No. 24,\nPl.’s Mem. of Law at 16.  \n“The existence of an anti-harassment policy with complaint procedures is an important\nconsideration in determining whether the employer has satisfied the first prong of this defense.”\nCaridad v. Metro-North Commuter R.R.\n, 191 F.3d 283, 295 (2d Cir. 1999).  Here, Defendants\napparently had an anti-sexual harassment policy in place while employing Plaintiff, but as notedabove, the Moving Defendants failed to produce certain materials relating to that policy duringdiscovery, and the Court has excluded them for purposes of the instant motion.  The MovingDefendants, however, produced part of the policy during discovery–“Onondaga County Sheriff’sDepartment Custody Division Policy Directive, Topic: Harassment, effective October 31, 1995,”\naccompanied by an update dated August 11, 1998 (the “Policy”)–which the Court will here examine.See Dkt. No. 21, Defs.’ Ex. E.  The Policy states: \nAny staff member who believes the action or words of a supervisor or fellow staff\nmember constitute unwelcome harassment has a responsibility to report such actionsas soon as possible to a supervisor or the next line of management not involved inthe harassment.  If the staff member is not  satisfied with the handling of a complaint\nor the action taken by the supervisor, the staff member should notify the next line of\nmanagement.\nDkt. No. 21, Defs.’ Ex. E.  The Policy only became effective some six months after Plaintiff began\nworking at the Justice Center in April 1995, when O’Dell commenced his harassment.  Thus, forCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 16 of 2817purposes of this motion, there was no policy in eff ect during Plaintiff’s firs t six months working at\nthe Justice Center.  The absence of a sexual harassm ent policy tends to negate Defendants’ assertion\nof the Burlington  affirmative defense.  Cf. Burlington , 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S. Ct. at 2270 (explaining\nthat the “need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be\naddressed in any case when litigating the first element of the defense”). \nWith respect to the remaining approximately th irteen months during which both Plaintiff and\nO’Dell were employed at the Justice Center, the Moving Defendants contend that Plaintiff did not\nfollow the Policy because she failed to report her allegations “to the next line of management not\ninvolved in the harassment.”  Plaintiff counters that she had a reasonable fear of reporting the\nharassment during her probationary period of employm ent and that when she came first forward with\nthe allegations of sexual harassment, her supervisors took no action.  \nPlaintiff offers little in the way of proof that  the Municipal Defendants have ever taken any\nadverse employment actions, such as firing or demotion, against an employee who has broughtallegations of sexual harassment to their attention.  Plaintiff’s reasons for not immediately reporting\nthe harassment in accordance with the Policy founder in speculation.  Cf. Caridad\n, 191 F.3d at 295\n(explaining that the plaintiff’s reasons for failing to report the harassment were “not based on a\ncredible fear that her complaint would not be take n seriously or that she would suffer some adverse\nemployment action as a result of filing a complaint” ).  Plaintiff argues, however, that she reported\nthe harassment to two supervisors, Sergeants Cogan and Ligoci.  \n“[U]nder Title VII an employer has notice of sexual harassment committed by coworkers\n‘where the employer (or its agents or supervis ory employees)’ knew ‘or should have known of the\nconduct.’”  Murray v. New York Univ. College of Dentistry , 57 F.3d 243, 249 (2d Cir. 1995)\n(quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(d)).  Plaintiff asserts that in accordance with the Policy, in and about\nNovember 1995, she reported O’Dell’s harassment to Cogan several times, but that in response heCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 17 of 2824equal protection of the laws.  Absent from Plaintiff’s pleadings are any facts with respect to the\nidentity of the officers treated differently, when such disparate treatment occurred and/or thefrequency with which it occurred.  Defendants argue  that such patently conclusory allegations do\nnot suffice under Rule 8.  See Dkt. No. 18, Defs.’ Mem. of Law at 21.  Plaintiff counters that the\nspecific acts of sexual harassment “which were . . . di rected at the plaintiff as a female deputy . . .\nwere not directed towards male deputies” and refere nces all the factual allegations contained in her\ncomplaint.  See Dkt. No. 24, Pl.’s Mem. of Law at 22.  The Court finds th at Plaintiff’s fourth cause\nof action has met Rule 8’s requirements and proceeds to her equal protection claim.   \nB. Equal Protection\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws,” U.S. C\nONST . amend. XIV, § 1, “which is essentially\na direction that all persons similarly situated shoul d be treated alike.”  C ity of Cleburne, Texas v.\nCleburne Living Center , 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985) (citation\nomitted).  \nThe Second Circuit has held that sex-based discrimination may be actionable under § 1983\nas a violation of equal protection.  See Kern v. City of Rochester , 93 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 1996);\nAnnis v. County of Westchester , 36 F.3d 251, 254 (2d Cir. 1994).  Section 1983 and the Equal\nProtection Clause protect public employees from  various forms of discrimination, including hostile\nwork environment and disparate treatment, on the ba sis of gender.  Once action under color of state\nlaw is established, Plaintiff’s equal protection claim parallels her Title VII claim, except that unlikea Title VII claim, a § 1983 claim can  be brought against individuals.  See Feingold v. New York\n, 366\nF.3d 138, 159 & n. 20 (2d Cir. 2004).  “The elements of  one are generally the same as the elements\nof the other and the two must stand or fall together.”  Id.  at 159 (citing Annis v. County of\nWestchester , 136 F.3d 239, 245 (2d Cir. 1998) (“In analyzing whether conduct was unlawfullyCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 24 of 288In support of her equal protection/disparate treatme nt claim, Plaintiff’s complaint relies upon the same\nallegations used to support her Title VII retaliation claim, i.e., the denial of her requests to transfer from “A-Watch” to\n“C-Watch,” and to the Booking Unit and Galka’s rescission of her lockdown order.    \n25discriminatory for purposes of § 1983, we borro w the burden-shifting framework of Title VII\nclaims.”)).  Therefore, the Court’s Title VII analysis, supra , similarly applies to Plaintiff’s equal\nprotection claim8 except that because § 1983 permits claims  against defendants in their individual\ncapacities, Plaintiff’s hostile work environment claim additionally survives summary judgment as\nto the individual Moving Defendants in their personal capacities.  Plaintiff’s equalprotection/disparate treatment claim, which is also analyzed under the McDonnell Douglas\n burden-\nshifting framework and which relies upon the same a llegations used to support Plaintiff’s Title VII\nretaliation claim, i.e., the denial of her requests to transfer  from “A-Watch” to “C-Watch,” and to\nthe Booking Unit and Galka’s rescission of her loc kdown order, however, similarly fails.  With this\nin mind, the Moving Defendants’ motion for summary  judgment with respect to Plaintiff’s fourth\ncause of action is GRANTED in part and DENIED  in part, and the Court must now determine\nwhether the individual Moving Defendants are shield ed from liability under the doctrine of qualified\nimmunity.  \nV. Qualified Immunity\nSheriff Walsh and Captains Al banese and Galka also move for summary judgement on the\nbasis of qualified immunity.  Dkt.  No. 18, Defs.’ Mem. of Law at 15.  Plaintiff contends that they\nare not entitled to qualified immunity.  Plaintiff argues that Captains Al banese and Galka knew of\nher involvement in protected activity and hindered her professional career by failing to grant transfer\nrequests and hindered her job performance by rescinding a lockdown order in retaliation.  See Dkt.\nNo. 24, Pl.’s Mem. of Law at 22.  Plai ntiff submits that “[i]f a question of fact exists as to retaliation\nby these officers, it must be sufficient to defeat qualified immunity.”  Id.  at 23.  Plaintiff adds that\nSheriff Walsh, as the most senior official within  the Sheriff’s Department, created “an atmosphereCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 25 of 2826that condoned actions and policies under which uncons titutional practices occurred or were allowed\nto occur.”  Id.     \nThe qualified immunity doctrine seeks to “str ike a fair balance between (1) the need to\nprovide a realistic avenue for vindication of constitutional guarantees, and (2) the need to protectpublic officials who are required to exercise th eir discretion and the re lated public interest in\nencouraging the vigorous exercise of official authority.”  Jemmott v. Coughlin\n, 85 F.3d 61, 66 (2d\nCir. 1996) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  The Supreme Court has held “that\ngovernment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability forcivil damages insofar as their conduct does not viol ate clearly established statutory or constitutional\nrights of which a reasonable person woul d have known.”  Harlow v. Fitzgerald\n, 457 U.S. 800, 818,\n102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).  “What this means in practice is that whether anofficial protected by qualified immunity may be held personally liable for an allegedly unlawfulofficial action generally turns on the objective legal reasonableness of the action, assessed in lightof the legal rules that were clearly estab lished at the time it was taken.”  Wilson v. Layne\n, 526 U.S.\n603, 614, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 ( 1999) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n“The qualified immunity standard ‘gives ample room for mistaken judgments’ by protecting ‘all butthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingl y violated the law.’”  Hunter v. Bryant\n, 502 U.S. 224,\n229, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991)  (quoting Malley v. Briggs , 475 U.S. 335, 341, 343, 106\nS.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986)).  The Second Circuit has observed that the qualified immunitydefense would be “hollow indeed” if public offici als “who may in the course  of carrying out their\nduties have continuing run-ins with those whose c onduct the officials must monitor, would be forced\nto go to trial when the only evidence of unconstitu tional motive may be a pr ior dispute with the\nplaintiff, if that.”  Blue v. Koren\n, 72 F.3d 1075, 1084 (2d Cir. 1995). \nHere, it is clear that when the alleged harassment occurred, Plaintiff had a constitutional rightCase 5:00-cv-01500-NPM-GJD   Document 28    Filed 07/06/06   Page 26 of 2827to be free from a gender-hostile work environment, Gonzalez v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Corr. Servs.\nFishkill Corr. Facility , 122 F.Supp.2d 335, 348 (N.D.N.Y. 2000) (“[F]reedom from discrimination\non account of gender . . . [is a] clearly establishe d right[].”), and retaliation for reporting the alleged\nharassment.  Cf. DiMarco v. Rome Hosp. and Murphy Hosp. , 1991 WL 336000, at *4 (N.D.N.Y.\nJuly 1, 1991).  There is no evidence to suggest, however, that Sheriff Walsh’s or CaptainsAlbanese’s and Galka’s conduct violated these clear ly established rights.  There is no evidence that\nthey acted with gross negligence or deliberate indifference in their supervisory capacities.  See Poe\nv. Leonard , 282 F.3d 123, 140-41 (2d Cir. 2002); Meriwether v.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Daniel Cobb, the plaintiff, sued Intel Corporation alleging age discrimination, retaliation for reporting age discrimination, and whistleblower retaliation for reporting nepotism. Cobb claimed his termination was motivated by age bias and his reporting of alleged nepotism. The court granted summary judgment in favor of Intel, determining Cobb failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that his termination was due to unlawful discrimination or retaliation.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Daniel Cobb's termination by Intel Corporation constituted unlawful age discrimination or retaliation for reporting age discrimination or alleging company nepotism.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Cobb did not present sufficient evidence to prove a prima facie case of age discrimination or retaliation. Particularly, Cobb could not establish a causal link between his protected activities (reporting age discrimination and alleged nepotism) and his termination. Intel's motion for summary judgment was granted on all claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Daniel Cobb worked for Intel and felt that he was fired because he was getting older and because he spoke up about a boss maybe hiring a family member unfairly. He sued the company, claiming it was against the law to fire him for those reasons. The court looked at the evidence and decided Cobb didn't have enough proof to show that he was fired because of his age or for speaking up, so the court sided with Intel, saying the company acted lawfully.",

Case No. 3:21 -cv-00416 -AR \n \n   OPINION  AND  ORDER\n_____________________________________  \n \nARMISTEAD, Magistrate Judge  \n \n Plaintiff Daniel Cobb brings this action against defendant Intel Corporation, his former \nemployer, asserting  three claims: wrongful  discharge of his employment  based on his age, \nviolating ORS § 659A.030, and retaliation  against him because he reported age discrimination Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 1 of 34 \n \nPage 2 – OPINION AND ORDER  and nepotism, violating ORS §§ 659A.030(1)(f) and 659A.199(1). Intel  moves  for summary \njudgment  on all three claims . For the reasons  explained below, the court  grants Intel’s motion.1 \nBACKGROUND  \n Intel is a technology company focused on computer processor chips, data storage, cloud \ncomputing, and the Internet of Things. (Decl. Diana Egusa ¶ 2, ECF No. 29.) Cobb began \nworking at Intel as an at -will employee as a Senior Technical Writer/Instructional Designer in \nJuly 2000. ( Egusa Decl. Ex. 2 at 1 ; Compl. ¶ 8.) His job responsibilities included designing, \nwriting, and revising technical papers, product descriptions, manuals, catalogs, user guides, and \ntechnical reference materials for Intel’s customer s for use with Intel’s products. (Egusa Decl. Ex. \n3; Decl. Keith Mahoney ¶ 2, ECF No. 28.) Technical Writers at Cobb’s Grade Level work \nclosely with product developments, engineers, release teams, and other stakeholders to develop \nand publish technical doc umentation. (Mahoney Decl. ¶ 3.) From 2000 through 2017, Cobb \nreceived positive annual performance reviews, stock awards, and bonuses. (Decl. Daniel Cobb ¶ \n45, ECF No. 41.)  \n In May 2017, Cobb began working in the Artificial Intelligence Products Group (AIPG) , \nwhich was  supervised by Mark Robins. Later that year, Keith Mahoney became his first -level \nmanager, and Robins became his second -level manager. ( Id. ¶ 46.) In a March 2018  evaluation \n \n1  All parties have consented to jurisdiction by magistrate judge under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 73  and 28 U.S.C. § 636(c) . The court con ducted oral argument on January 24, 2024.   Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 2 of 34 \n \nPage 3 – OPINION AND ORDER  of Cobb’s performance from  May through December 2017 , Mahoney described Cobb’s strengths \nas being “schedule -driven and dedicated to completing deliverables,” that he delivers “high \nquality, on schedule customer documentation,” and that he enjoys “digging into technical \nconcepts” allowing him to convey comple x topics more “directly and concisely.” (Mahoney \nDecl. Ex. 1.)    \n The events leading up to Cobb’s termination occurred in 2018 and 2019.  In early 2018, \nCobb learned from another employee that Robins hired a User Interface Engineer named Katy \nSpaulding . He believed that Spa ulding was Robins’ niece by marriage. Cobb thought that \nSpaulding’s hire violated Intel’s strict Code of Conduct , which  prohibits nepotism and conflicts \nof interest. Cobb also was concerned that Spaulding was unaware of Intel’s policies and that she \ncould lose her job. ( Cobb Decl. ¶¶ 47 -49.) Cobb messag ed Spaulding over Slack. ( Id. ¶ 49; Decl. \nKevin Coles Ex. 1 at 1 -3, ECF No. 30 -1.) After some back-and-forth  Slack messages, Spaulding \nabruptly stopped responding to Cobb when he asked if she was related to Robins. (Cole Decl. \nEx. 1 at 3.) Cobb believes that Spaulding then called Robins to discuss the matter because \nSpaulding failed to resume their Slack convers ation.  (Cobb Decl. ¶ 49.)  In the spring of 2018, \nCobb asked Mahoney if Spaulding was Robins’ niece and Mahoney responded, “we’re not \ntalking about it.” (Coles Decl. Ex. 3 (Cobb Dep.) 33:7 -20, ECF No. 30 -1.) Soon after, Cobb and \nMahoney’s working relationsh ip soured.  Mahoney began sending Cobb emails  that Cobb \nperceives as aggressive and harassing , and confrontations between them occurred at least \nweekly. (Cobb Decl. ¶ 50.)  Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 3 of 34 \n \nPage 4 – OPINION AND ORDER    In June 2018, Mahoney began to ask questions about Cobb’s retirement plans. Mahoney \nasked him: “When are you planning to retire?”; “How old are you?”; “After all these years you \nmust be ready to retire?”; “Are you vested yet?”; “Do you qualify for the Ru le of 75?”; and “I’d \nbe looking forward to retirement if I were you.” Mahoney also asked Cobb, “Do you dye your \nhair?” Cobb felt the question was insulting and embarrassing because he then dyed his gray hair \nbrown. Mahoney’s questions typically occurred in  a conference room or out of earshot of others.  \nCobb assured Mahoney that he intended to continue working for at least four more years.  (Id. ¶¶ \n53-54.)   \n Roughly one month after Mahoney’s retirement questions, Cobb met with a friend and \nformer Intel manager, Jack Thornton, to discuss Mahoney’s harassment. Thornton advised Cobb \nto work hard and look for another position at Intel. When Mahoney realized Cobb was not \nretiring, Cobb believes that Mahoney’s actions became more overt. (Cobb Decl. ¶ 55  & Ex. 3 .)  \n In the summer of 2018, Mahoney banned Cobb from attending team meetings that \ninvolved planning for upcoming projects. (Cobb Decl. ¶ 56.) The AIPG group, including Cobb, \nMahoney, other Intel workers, and a team of engineers in Poland (the Poland team), worked on a \nprogram named Deep Learning Studio (DLS). (Cobb Dep. 46:8 -15.) Cobb was to provide a User \nGuide and other user -oriented technical documents to developers and an important Intel \ncustomer. ( Id. 46:16 –47:10; Mahoney Decl. ¶ 10.) Cobb was asked to cre ate and provide an \nHTML file set for the Poland team and the same materials in Word and PDF format for the \ncustomer. (Cobb Dep. 48:2 -13; Mahoney Decl. ¶ 10.) The entire DLS team was under pressure Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 4 of 34 \n \nPage 5 – OPINION AND ORDER  to coordinate responsibilities to meet a tight timeline. (Cobb Dep. 48:2 -13.) Cobb missed a DLS \nteam meeting on July 10 . (Id. 68:16 -19; Mahoney Decl. ¶ 11, Exs. 5 & 6.)   \n The DLS team agreed that Cobb would prepare and place a CLI Commands summary \ndocument in Google Docs to enable the entire DLS team to review it and provide comments. \nAlthough Cobb believed that the document would be reviewed in Google Docs, the Poland team \nwanted the document reviewed through a different tool called Git.  At one point, the DLS Project \nManager Bethany Dalby revised the Poland team’s input, and Cobb felt that the Poland team’s \ninteraction and input was severely lacking. On July 17, Cobb emaile d a Poland team member \nasking him to follow through on his commitments. (Cobb Decl. ¶ 57.)  \n Mahoney disagreed with the tone and word choice in Cobb’s July 17 email to the Poland \nteam member. (Cobb Decl. ¶ 58.) Mahoney emailed Cobb and asked that Cobb be more sensitive \nwith his communications and suggested that he be more positive and less harsh.  Mahoney \nadmonished  Cobb for using the word “chore” and for criticizing a particular person in an email \nthread that included several other team members. (Mahoney Decl. Ex. 8.) Cobb did not believe \nthat the July 17 email was offensive or aggressive. (Cobb D ecl. ¶ 58.) On July 19, Cobb missed \nanother DLS team meeting. (Cobb Dep. 68:16 -19; Mahoney Decl. ¶ 11, Exs. 5 & 6.)  \n On July 23, Mahoney and Cobb met for a one -on-one meeting at an Intel café. (Cobb \nDecl. ¶ 60; Mahoney Decl. ¶ 17.) Mahoney was angry and claimed that Cobb’s emails were \noffensive, contained typos, and he complained that Cobb used profanity. The only example of \npoor communication that Mahoney provide d to Cobb was that Cobb used the word “chore” \ninstead of “task.” Cobb promised not to use profanity. Mahoney was so upset he jerked his body Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 5 of 34 \n \nPage 6 – OPINION AND ORDER  around and spat as he spoke. After the meeting, Mahoney emailed Cobb summarizing their \nmeeting, including that Cobb was not performing to grade level and that he missed two important \nmeetings: one where he was to present information and another where he mi ssed key project -\nrelated information. Mahoney mentioned in the email that the Poland team had to escalate the \nissue about Cobb’s performance. Mahoney informed Cobb that he needed to improve his \ncommunication, work onsite moving forward, and that Cobb’s des ire to change his job code was \n“now closed.” Mahoney also warned Cobb that failure to improve his performance may lead to \ndisciplinary action.  Cobb was confused by Mahoney’s follow -up email because Cobb was not \nscheduled to present anything at the missed meeting, he was unaware that the Poland team \nescalated any issue, and that Mahoney instigated the discussion about job codes. (Cobb Decl. ¶¶ \n62-67 & Ex. 7 .)  \n On July 25, Mahoney demanded that Cobb delete his training demonstration videos.  \nCobb had previously recorded his interviews with Subject Matter Experts that showed those \nexperts using the DLS product for which he was writing the User Guide. Cobb needed the videos \nto prepare the User Guide and was frustrated that he was being asked to delete them because \ndemonstration videos are common -place tools to aid technical writers. Cobb assured Mahoney \nthat he had obtained permission from Intel’s legal department to record the videos. Mahoney \nnevertheless insisted that Cobb delete the videos, in cluding a video that Cobb and Dalby \nrecorded a few days earlier. Mahoney emailed Cobb a copy of Intel’s recording policy and \ninsisted that Cobb delete all the recordings, including the one he made with Dalby. Mahoney \nsuggested to Cobb that he could be fire d if he did not delete the video, so Cobb complied with Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 6 of 34 \n \nPage 7 – OPINION AND ORDER  Mahoney’s instruction. When Dalby asked Cobb for the video a few days later, she became upset \nthat the video was deleted. Intel’s legal department later informed Mahoney that the videos were \nallowed, and Cobb believes that Mahoney made him delete the videos to sabotage his work and \nthat Mahoney was manufacturing reasons to fire him. (Cobb Decl. ¶¶ 6 8-70 & Ex. 9 .)  \n Mahoney and Cobb agreed to run deeper technical questions through the Poland team.  On \nJuly 31, Cobb emailed Dalby about user roles. The next day, Mahoney informed Cobb that he \nwas to route all his communication on the DLS project through the Poland team, and no longer \nthrough Dalby, because Dalby was “incredibly band -width constrained.” (Cobb Decl. ¶ 72 & Ex. \n10.)   \n On August 6, Mahoney and Cobb again met one -on-one at an Intel café to discuss Cobb’s \nwork performance. (Mahoney Decl. ¶ 19.) Cobb felt he was being interrogated, harassed, and \nintimidated by Mahoney. Mahoney was mad that Cobb was running questions throug h Dalby and \ncontended that Cobb was being disruptive. Mahoney was upset about Cobb recording videos and \naccused Cobb of not knowing how to use the Git software. Mahoney complained that Cobb used \nGoogle Docs instead of Git, had poor communication skills wit h the Poland team, and Mahoney \nsaid that he had received complaints about Cobb. Mahoney told Cobb that he was not performing \nat senior writer level and was trending toward a rating of “Improvement Required.” (Cobb Decl. \n¶¶ 73-75, 79 -81, 87, 96 ; Mahoney Decl. ¶ 19.) Mahoney also suggested that Cobb may need time \noff and that Cobb should seek professional help. (Cobb Decl. ¶ 85; Mahoney Decl. ¶19.)   \n On August 8, Mahoney sent an email summarizing their second one -on-one meeting.  In \nthat email, Mahoney said that Cobb became upset during their conversation many times and that Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 7 of 34 \n \nPage 8 – OPINION AND ORDER  Cobb told Mahoney he needed to be careful. Mahoney expressed confusion about Cobb’s \nbehavior, that he wanted Cobb to be successful, and Mahoney included a list of resources in case \nCobb was having personal issues.  Cobb thought Mahoney believed he may have a disability. \n(Cobb Decl. ¶ 85 -86, Ex s. 11-12.) \n  On August 21, Cobb initiated an Open Door  Investigation (ODI) into Mahoney’s \nbehavior.  Intel HR representative CJ Dragen conducted the ODI. Cobb explained to Dragen that \nMahoney was on a campaign to end his employment  by making  several false claims of \nmisbehavior , refus ing to provide supporting documentation for his errors , interfer ing with his \ninternal job search , and being physically intimidating during their second meeting. (Cobb Decl. \n¶ 100 & Ex. 13.) Dragen investigated , finding  no evidence to support Cobb’s allegations of \nphysical threats or  job search interference by Mahoney. (Egusa Decl. Ex. 9.) As to  Cobb’s \ncomplaints that Mahoney was overly  critical of Cobb’s work, Dragen found that Cobb’s work \nrequired “multiple changes” and that the project manager made additional revisions to Cobb’s \nwork to ensure the work was “consumable for customers.”  Dragen also coached Mahoney to be \nclear and concise with performance expectations and offered to provide HR counseling between \nCobb and Mahoney. ( Id.; Cobb Decl. ¶ 100.) Cobb declined to participate in counseling. Dragen \nclosed the ODI on September 26 . (Egusa Decl. Ex. 9.)  \n On September 9, Cobb uploaded the HTML versions of the Alpha DLS User Guide into \nGit and said that the Word and PDF versions were complete. Cobb circulated the Word version \nof the User Guide on September 10 . (Cobb Decl. Exs . 14-15.) On September 11, Cobb emailed \nthe Poland team to say that the HTML Alpha DLS User Guide file set was ready for testing, and Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 8 of 34 \n \nPage 9 – OPINION AND ORDER  so Cobb’s portion the project was technically done. (Mahoney Decl. Ex. 17; Cobb Decl. ¶ 105 & \nEx. 16.) In Cobb’s view, his documents were delivered on time. On September 12, Jacek \nChrapkowski, a Poland team member, let Cobb know that the HTML version conta ined a \ntemporary Intel logo that needed to be fixed. On September 18, Cobb emailed his Word version \nof the Alpha User Guide and Help system for sign -off with engineering and said that he was not \naware that the team planned to place a Word version of those two documents into Git. On \nSeptember 19, Cobb was informed by the Poland team that a “protext scan” revealed that the \nHTML versions contained protected code and could not be included in the Alpha release, so the \nPDF versions would have to be used for deliv ery to the customer. (Cobb Decl. ¶¶ 101, 106 & \nExs. 18-19, 21.)  \n In October 2018, the AIPG received a Division Recognition Award (DRA) for delivering \nthe DLS Alpha version. Cobb’s name was excluded from the DRA. (Cobb Decl. ¶ 111.)  \n On October 31, Mahoney gave Cobb a Written Warning (WW) and Corrective Action \nPlan (CAP). (Cobb Decl. ¶ 112; Mahoney Decl. Ex. 21.) In the WW/CAP, Mahoney identified \nseveral issues with the quality of Cobb’s work, his ability to meet deadlines, his abilit y to \nproblem -solve, follow departmental standards, and said that Cobb’s deficiencies negatively \naffected the customer and caused the team to perform unneeded re -reviews. (Cobb Decl. Ex. 22 ; \nMahoney Decl. Ex 21 .) The WW/CAP identified expectations and measu rements, such as \ndelivering “all schedule & project -related items completely, correctly, and on time and send[] \nmanager a weekly confirmation.”  The WW/CAP also stated that failure to make sufficient \nprogress and improvement within 60 days could result in termination. Under the WW/CAP, Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 9 of 34 \n \nPage 10 – OPINION AND ORDER  Cobb could “voluntarily resign and receive a buyout severance package as an alternative to \nworking through the expectations of the written warning.”  (Mahoney Decl. Ex. 21.)  \n On November 5, Cobb filed another ODI.  In it, Cobb asserted that Mahoney gave him a \nWW/CAP “based on fabricated, false, and highly inflated statements.”  Cobb informed HR that \nMahoney had a personal grudge against him and was “intent on ending his employment for no \napparent reason, other than perhaps my age?” Intel’s ODI investigation was conducted by \nSuzanne Fowler and Cortney Rothman -Ivy, who had deep technical writing expertise. ( Egusa \nDecl. Exs. 10-11.)  \n On November 11, Mahoney told Cobb that he was leaving for an extended vacation \n(November 14 to December 10) and could not be reached. (Cobb Decl. ¶ 158.) While Mahoney \nwas out, the DLS team was responsible for preparing to release the Beta version of the project \nand Cobb would have to finish Mahoney’s Beta Installation Guide. (Burgess Decl. Ex. 2, \n(Mahoney Dep. ) 99:11 –101:2 , ECF No. 40 -2.) Before he left, Mahoney told Cobb that only two \nissues remained to be completed on the Installation Guide.  Soon after Mahoney left, however, \nthe Poland team informed Cobb that the Installation Guide .MD markdown version in Git was \nnot the same as Mahoney’s Word version. This error required Cobb to spend two days \nreconciling the two versions and put Cobb behind on his own work. (Cobb Decl. ¶ ¶ 154,  157.)  \n On November 17, Cobb circulated his Beta User Guide  for final review and sign -off, \nwhich incorporated content from other  DLS team members. On November 29, Poland team \nmember Darius Szyfelbein reviewed a second version of the Beta User Guide (Beta Review II) \nand informed Cobb that 46 items were yet to be fixed  from his first review, and that he added 28 Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 10 of 34 \n \nPage 11 – OPINION AND ORDER  new comments to Beta Review II. (Coles Decl. Ex. 5; Cobb Decl. Ex. 28.) The next day,  \nSzyfelbein informed Cobb that  he added 16 new comments to the Beta Installation Guide, and \nthat 19 items remained to be fixed  from his comments to the Alpha release. (Cobb Decl. Ex. 29.)  \nOn December 2 and 3, Cobb traded emails with Szyfelbein about  the Beta User Guide, and on \nDecember 3, Cobb circulated a revised Beta User Guide that incorporated the lion’s share of  \nSzyfelbein’s comments . (Coles Decl. Ex. 6; Cobb Decl. Ex.  30.) On December 3, the Poland \nteam stated that Cobb’s changes to the User Guide were satisfactory, and that they would set up a \nmeeting to discuss any outstanding issues. That day, Cobb also completed the Release Notes and \nfinaliz ed the Beta Installation Guide , reconciling the comments from Szyfelbein . The Beta \nversions of the User Guide, Installation Guide, and Release Notes were completed for Intel’s \ncustomer in Word, PDF, and HTML on time Monday, December 3, 2018. (Cobb Decl. ¶¶ 158 -59, \nExs. 33-34; Coles Decl . Exs. 4 -5.) On December 10, Szyfelbein informed Cobb that several \ncomments from the pull requests were not included in the Beta User Guide. (Coles Decl. Ex. 6.)   \nIn January 2019, the DLS project was cancelled and moved to open source under the \nname Nauta; Cobb’s Word and HTML versions of the User Guide were not used for the Nauta  \nOpen R elease. Cobb received special recognition from Carlos Humberto Morales for his hard \nwork moving Nauta to open source on January 25, 2019. (Cobb Decl.  ¶ 199 &  Ex. 35.)   \n Cobb believes that Mahoney took vacation after giving him the WW/CAP to put \nadditional pressure on him and increase his likelihood of failure. Mahoney knew that the DLS \nproject would be cancelled and that Cobb’s efforts in finalizing the User Guide materi als in \nWord and HTML ultimately would be useless. ( Cobb Decl. ¶ ¶ 155, 200.)  Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 11 of 34 \n \nPage 12 – OPINION AND ORDER   In mid -January 2019, Cobb was interested in transferring departments. On January 18, \nCobb interviewed with the RA4 Advance Technology Group. Cobb asked Human Resources \nwhen his WW/CAP expired and was told December 31, 2018. Cobb also spoke with the AIPG \noperations manager, Wanda McKenzie, on January 29, and explained that he was seeking to \ntransfer. McKenzie expressed that she would help Cobb. (Cobb Decl. ¶ ¶ 202, 206 & Exs. 36 -38.)  \n On January 29, Mahoney informed Robins, Regis, and Dragen that Cobb had not satisfied \nthe expectations set out in the WW/CAP. (Cobb Decl. ¶ 207; Mahoney Decl. ¶ 29 & Ex. 23.) On \nFebruary 6, Mahoney terminated Cobb’s employment effective February 15. (Maho ney Decl. \n¶ 30.)  \n On February 9, Cobb launched a third ODI challenging his termination.  In that ODI, \nCobb acknowledged that he failed to timely deliver markdown versions of the User Guide and \nInstallation Guide yet asserts that Mahoney sabotaged him by leaving town during the Beta \nrelease deadline and by leaving him with an Installation Guide that had several errors and \ndoubled his workload.  Cobb also expressed concern that no one else would hire him at his age \nand requested that he be reinstated. Cobb viewed Mahoney as ins ecure, that Mahoney treated \nhim as a threat, and that his inquiry about nepotism led to his termination. (Egusa Decl. Ex s. 14, \n16.)  \n On April 13, Anil Gupta, a manager with the Advance Technology Group emailed Cobb \nto ask if he was still interested in the technical writer position. Cobb responded that he remained \ninterested, but needed to wait until it was cleared with Intel’s legal de partment. Cobb was \ninformed that he could only return to work at Intel as a contractor, earning around $85,000 Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 12 of 34 \n \nPage 13 – OPINION AND ORDER  annually (or roughly half his previous annual compensation of $168,000.) (Cobb Decl. ¶¶ 209, \n211 & Ex. 40 .) On May 17, the ODI investigation upheld his termination. (Egusa  Decl. Ex. 18.) \nIn June 2019, Mahoney hired Cobb’s replacement – a 60-year-old technical writer with 20 years \nof experience. (Mahoney Decl. ¶ 31 & Ex. 24.)   \nLEGAL STANDARDS  \nSummary judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine dispute as to any material \nfact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(a) . A party \nseeking summary judgment bears the burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact. Celotex v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) . If the moving party demonstrates no \nissue of material fact exists, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings and identify \nfacts which show a genuine issue for trial. Id. at 324 . A party cannot defeat a summary judgment \nmotion by relying on the allegations set forth in the complaint, on unsupported conjecture, or on \nconclusory statements. Hernandez v. Spacelabs Med., Inc. , 343 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir. 2003) . \nSummary judgment thus should be entered against “a party who fails to make a showing \nsufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that \nparty will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex , 477 U.S. at 322 . \nIn determining whether to grant summary judgment, the court must view the evidence in \nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Curley v. City of N. Las Vegas , 772 F.3d 629, \n631 (9th Cir. 2014) ; Hernandez , 343 F.3d at 1112 . All reasonable doubt as to the existence of a \ngenuine issue of fact should be resolved against the moving party. Hector v. Wiens , 533 F.2d \n429, 432 (9th Cir. 1976) . But deference to the nonmoving party has limits. The nonmoving party Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 13 of 34 \n \nPage 14 – OPINION AND ORDER  must set forth “specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.” FED. R. CIV. P. 56(e) . The “mere \nexistence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff’s position [is] insufficient.” \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986) ; Chong v. STL Int’l, Inc. , 152 F. Supp. \n3d 1305, 1309 (D. Or. 2016) . Therefore, where “the record taken as a whole could not lead a \nrational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue for trial.” \nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp. , 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)  (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  \nDISCUSSION  \n Cobb brings three claims: (1) age discrimination under ORS § 659A.030(1)(a); (2) \nretaliation for reporting age discrimination under ORS § 659A.030(f); and (3) retaliation in \nviolation of Oregon’s whistleblower statute, ORS § 659A.199. Intel moves for summ ary \njudgment on all three claims.  \nA.  Age Discrimination – Disparate Treatment  \n Oregon law prohibits an employer from discharging from employment because of age if \nthe individual is older than 18.  ORS § 659A.030(1)(a).  “The Ninth Circuit has described ORS \n§ 659A.030 as ‘Oregon ’s parallel age discrimination statute ’ to the federal Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act of 1967 (ADEA), Enlow v. Salem -Keizer Yellow Cab Co., Inc. , 389 F.3d 802, \n810 (9th Cir. 2004), and courts in this district have analyzed age discrimination claims under \nthese statutes under the same framework. ” Hunter v. FedEx Corp. Servs., Inc. , No. 3:22 -cv-\n1217 -SI, 2024 WL 1020870, at *2 (D. Or. Feb. 21, 2024) . Consequently, for resolving motions \nfor summary judgment, the court applies the framework for assessing an age discrimination Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 14 of 34 \n \nPage 15 – OPINION AND ORDER  claim under the burden -shifting framework described by the Ninth Circuit , which  is determined \nin three steps : (1) plaintiff  must make  a prima facie  case of discriminatory motive ; (2) the \nemployer  then must articulate  a legitimate nondiscriminatory motive; and (3) finally, the \nemployee must show that the articulate d reason is pretext ual.2 Opara, 57 F.4th at 721-23.  \n1. Step one: prima facie case \nA plaintiff may establish a prima facie  case in two ways: by “produc ing direct or \ncircumstantial evidence demonstrating that a discriminatory reason more likely than not \nmotivated the defendant ’s contested conduct ” or “using the McDonne ll Douglas  framework.” \nOpara v. Yellen , 57 F.4th 709, 721 (9th Cir. 2023) (simplified). Under McDonnell  Douglas , the \nfactors for showing age discrimination are: (1) membership in a protected class; (2) satisfactory \njob performance; (3) discharge; and (4) replace ment  by a “substantially younger employee with \n \n2  The parties dispute the causation standard for age discrimination  claims , with Cobb  \nasserting a “substantial factor ” causation standard and Intel asserting a “but for” causation \nstandard.  However, this case is at the summary judgment  stage , and the “but for causation ” \nstandard that Intel asserts is meant  for trial. See Hunter v. FedEx Corp. Servs., Inc. , No. 3:22 -cv-\n1217 -SI, 2024 WL 1020870, at *3 (D. Or. Feb. 21, 2024) (observing that “ the law of the Ninth \nCircuit continues to require that district courts apply the McDonnell Douglas  burden -shifting \nframework to ADEA claims and claims under the parallel Oregon age discrimination law at the \nsummary judgment stage ” (citing  Dawson v. Entek Int ’l, 630 F.3d 928, 935 (9th Cir. 2011 ))). \n \n \n Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 15 of 34 \n \nPage 16 – OPINION AND ORDER  equal or inferior qualifications .” Id. at 722 (quoting Coleman v. Quaker Oats Co. , 232 F.3d 1271, \n1281 (9th Cir. 2000) ); Siring v. Or. State Bd. of Higher Educ. , 927 F. Supp. 2d 1030, 1052 (D. \nOr. 2012) . Cobb , however,  cannot establish a prima facie  case under the McDonnell Douglas  \nframework  because it is undisputed that his replacement was 60 years old and had 20 years of \nexperience. If confined to the McDonnell Douglas  factors, Intel would prevail on summary \njudgment because Cobb cannot make his prima facie  case. (Egusa Decl. ¶ 17, Ex. 15; Mahoney \nDecl. ¶ 31.) The court therefore proceeds to analyze  Cobb ’s age discrimination claim  under the \nfirst described in Opara —direct or circumstantial evidence  of discriminatory mo tive. Under that \napproach, th e degree of proof necessary to establish a prima facie  case is minimal. Opara , 57 \nF.4th at 722  (citing Schnidrig  v. Columbia Mach., Inc. , 80 F.3d 1406, 1409 (9th Cir. 1996)  \n(“When a plaintiff .  . . seeks to establish a prima facie case through the submission of actual \nevidence, very little such evidence is necessary.” )).  \nIntel disputes that Cobb has established a prima facie  case, contending that Cobb cannot \nshow that he was performing to its expectations . Intel points to evidence showing that in the \nmonths before Cobb’s termination, Mahoney inquired with Intel’s HR department  about \nmanaging Cobb’s performance ; performance issues continued ; he was given a written warning  \nand placed on a corrective action  plan; and that his performance decline d and he was terminated. \nIntel also argues that Cobb’s own assessment of his performance cannot raise a genuine issue of \nmaterial fact. (Def.’s Reply at 6, ECF No. 42 (citing Coleman , 232 F.3d at 1285 ).)   \nAs noted, the amount of evidence Cobb must produce at this stage is minimal . He has met \nit. Cobb  has shown that he  was performing well until Mahoney became his supervisor, Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 16 of 34 \n \nPage 17 – OPINION AND ORDER  highlighting that he was employed by Intel for nearly 19 years, and that his performance reviews \n– including the  2017  review – were positive. (Mahoney Decl. Ex. 1.)  After Mahoney became his \nsupervisor, he  faced repeated questions by Mahoney about retirement  and was asked about  \ndyeing his hair . (Pl.’s Resp. at 39.)  Because “very little” evidence is needed to establish a prima \nfacie  case of age discrimination and all uncertainties must be resolved in Cobb’s favor , Opara , \n57 F.4th at 725, those circumstances sufficiently give rise to an inference of discrimination  and \nCobb has established  a prima facie  case of age discrimination.  \n2. Step Two: Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reasons  \nIf a plaintiff establishes a prima facie  case, then the “ burden shifts to the employer to \narticulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action. ” Opara , 57 F.4th \nat 723 (simplified). Cobb concedes that Intel has articulated legitimate, nondiscriminatory \nreasons for his termination  and, therefore , the court turns directly to whether Intel’s rationales for \nCobb’s termination are pretextual. (Pl.’s Resp. at 39 -40.)  \n3. Step Three: P retext  \n The burden shift s back to Cobb to demonstrate that Intel’s reasons for his termination \nwere merely a pretext for discrimination.  A plaintiff asserting age discrimination can “prove \npretext  in multiple ways, either : (1) directly, by showing that unlawful discrimination more \nlikely than not motivated the employer;  (2) indirectly, by showing that the employer’s proffered \nexplanation is unworthy of credence because it is internally inconsistent or otherwise not \nbelievable ; or via a combination of these two kinds of evidence. ” Opara , 57 F.4th at 723 Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 17 of 34 \n \nPage 30 – OPINION AND ORDER  engaged in a protected activity; (2) he was later subjected to an adverse employment action; and \n(3) a causal link exists between the two. Tornabene , 156 F. Supp. 3d at 1248  (discussing \nretaliation under § 659A.030(f)); Larmanger , 895 F. Supp. 2d at 1053 (discussing retaliation \nunder § 659A.199). If Cobb satisfies this burden, Intel must articulate a legitimate, \nnondiscriminatory reason for his termination. Larmanger , 895 F. Supp. 2d at 1049 . If Intel does \nso, Cobb bears the burden of showing that Intel’s proffered explanation is merely a pretext for \nretaliation. Id. To avoid summary judgment on the causation element of his retaliation claims, \nCobb must submit evidence that, when viewed in his favor, would show that Intel’s allegedly \n“wrongful purpose is a factor that made a difference in the discharge decision.” Larmanger , 895 \nF. Supp. 2d at 1049  (quoting Estes v. Lewis & Clark Coll. , 152 Or. App. 372, 381 (1998)  \n(simplified)).  “To show the requisite causal link, the plaintiff must present evidence sufficient to \nraise the inference that her protected activity was the likely reason for the adverse action.” Cohen \nv. Fred Meyer, Inc. , 686 F.2d 793, 796 (9th Cir. 1982). “Essential to a causal link is evidence \nthat the employer was aware that the plaintiff had engaged in the protected activity.” Id.  \n 1. ORS § 659A.030(1)(f)  \n Intel contends that Cobb cannot establish a prima facie  case of retaliation under ORS \n§ 659A.030(1)(f) because Cobb has not shown that he complained of age discrimination until \nafter Intel issued the WW/CAP. Because  Cobb  testified in his deposition that he avoided \nmentioning age discrimination until after he was terminated, Intel contends that he therefore \ncannot establish a genuine issue of material fact on causation. (Cobb Dep. 37:16 –40:2.) And, Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 30 of 34 \n \nPage 31 – OPINION AND ORDER  Intel argues, Cobb has identified no evidence showing a causal link between his complaint about \nage discrimination and his termination . In Intel’s view, he cannot establish causation.  \n In his responsive briefing , Cobb does not address the retaliation claim based on reporting \nage discrimination and thus appears to concede it. Rightfully so. Cobb’s complaint does not \nspecify when he complained of age discrimination. Moreover, during his deposition testimony  \nand again during oral argument , Cobb he stated that he avoided complaining about age \ndiscrimination until after  his termination.  \nQ. . . . When was the first time that you complained to Intel about age \ndiscrimination?  \n \nA. That’s a good question. I wanted to continue working at Intel more than \nanything. . . . So I avoided at all costs bringing up the word age discrimination \nbecause in my view when you mention that you are throwing a bomb into this \nrelationship and I avoid ed mentioning that religiously.  \n \nQ. Okay. And, in fact, you didn’t mention it until after you received the \ncorrective action plan; isn’t that correct?  \n \nA. I’m not quite sure when I – when I mentioned it. Yeah, for me it became \nsomething I was going to pursue aggressively after I was fired and it was clear \nthere was no chance that I was going to return to employment there[.]  \n \n. . . . \n \nQ. . . . And my question is if we want to determine the earliest date that you \nraised a complaint of age discrimination, that would be in the written \ndocumentation that you have provided to Intel; isn’t that correct?  \n \nA. It is likely that it would be. . . . And I can’t say with – I can’t say with \nabsolute certainty when I first brought it up with Intel. It was something I wanted \nto avoid.  \n Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 31 of 34 \n \nPage 32 – OPINION AND ORDER  (Coles Decl. Ex. 3, Cobb Dep. 37:16 –37:13.) Cobb’s own testimony, therefore, shows that he \navoided discussing age discrimination during his employment, undercutting his retaliation claim.  \nIntel’s documentation also undermines his retaliation claim. In Cobb’s November 5, 2018 \nODI complaint, he stated that Mahoney has a personal grudge against him “for no apparent \nreason, other than perhaps my age.” (Egusa Decl. Ex. 10.) Cobb’s ODI complaint, however, was \nopened three months after Mahoney expressed performance concerns to Cobb (Mahoney Decl. \nEx. 11) (July 23, 2018 one -on-one meeting stating “failure to improve your performance may \nlead to disciplinary action”), and after Mahoney issued a writt en warning and implemented the \ncorrective action plan (Mahoney Decl. Ex. 21) (WW/CAP signed by Mahoney on October 31, \n2018 and Cobb on November 5, 2018). Th at timing shows that Cobb’s protected activity \nfollowed Intel’s concerns about Cobb’s performance, thus defeating his prima facie  case.  \nAnd Cobb presents no direct or circumstantial evidence of a causal nexus – Cobb \nidentifies no evidence that Mahoney knew Cobb filed the November 5 ODI or that Mahoney was \naware of its contents. Thus, Cobb has not shown that his report of age discrimination pla yed any \nrole in his termination, let alone was a “factor that made a difference.” See Larmanger , 895 F. \nSupp. 2d at 1049  (stating that to survive summary judgment on retaliation, employee must show \nthat “the employer would not have made the same decision absent a discriminatory motive” \n(simplified)). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Cobb, he has presented  no \nevidence from which a jury could conclude that he was terminated in retaliation for reporting age \ndiscrimination. Intel is granted summary judgment on this claim.  \n Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 32 of 34 \n \nPage 33 – OPINION AND ORDER  2. ORS § 659A.199(1)  \nCobb argues that he was retaliated against for reporting suspected nepotism  to HR  – that \nRobins hired his niece  Spaulding – and that soon after making his report, Mahoney began his \ncampaign to discredit and discipline him. (Pl.’s Resp. at 45 -46.) Cobb contends that he had a \ngood faith belief that nepotism violated internal Intel policy and employment laws applicable to \nIntel. The temporal proximity  alone  between his report  and Mahoney’s criticism of his wor k, in \nCobb’s view, raises an inference of causation. ( Id. at 46.) The court disagrees.  \nEven if Cobb’s report of nepotism was made in good faith and could constitute protected \nactivity under the statute , as argued by Intel, his whistleblower retaliation claim fails because he \nidentifies no causal link between his report of nepotism and his discipline or termination.  Cobb \nhas not identified any evidence showing that either Mahoney or Robins were aware that Cobb \nreported his suspicions of nepotism to Intel’s HR department.  During his deposition, Cobb \nadmitted that  he asked Mahoney if Spaulding was Robins’ niece  but admits he did not use the \nterm “nepotism .” (Cobb Dep. 36:9 –37:11.) And Cobb testified that he had no knowledge that \nRobins was aware of Cobb’s nepotism concerns . (Cobb Dep. 70:8 -12). Robins , for his part, \ntestified that he w as not aware that Cobb raised any concerns about nepotism until this lawsuit  \nwas filed. (Egusa Decl. Ex. 5; Mahoney Decl. ¶ 33.)   \nAside from the temporal proximity alone, Cobb identifies no circumstantial evidenc e that \nwould allow a reasonable jury to infer that Mahoney or Robins  somehow l earned of his \ncomplaint to HR . See Cohen , 686 F.2d at 796  (noting it is “essential to a causal link” that the \nemployer was aware of the protected activity ); cf. Karthauser v. Columbia 9 -1-1 Commc ’ns Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 33 of 34 \n \nPage 34 – OPINION AND ORDER  Dist. , 647 F. Supp. 3d 992, 1014 -15 (D. Or. 2022) (discussing circumstantial evidence showing \nreasonable inference that decisionmakers became aware of protected conduct through meetings, \nemails, and frien dship) . Because Cobb  points to no evidence showing that Mahoney or Robins \nwere aware of his nepotism report to HR or circumstantial evidence supporting a reasonable \ninference that they learned of his report , he fails to create a prima facie case on his whistleblower \nretaliation claim. Consequently, Intel is granted summa ry judgment on Cobb’s ORS \n§ 695A.199(1) claim.   \nCONCLUSION  \n For the above reasons, Intel’s motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 27) is \nGRANTED.  \nDATED: June 4 , 202 4. \n \n \n \n   ___________________________  \nJEFF ARMISTEAD  \n     United States Magistrate Judge  \n  \n Case 3:21-cv-00416-AR    Document 48    Filed 06/04/24    Page 34 of 34",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In *United States v. Anthony D. Bressi*, the defendant filed a Daubert motion to exclude testimony from government experts, contending improper disclosure and unreliable methods. The court largely denied the motion, finding the experts qualified and their methods reliable, but granted it partially due to the government's failure to provide timely disclosure under amended Rule 16. AI, machine learning, or automated systems do not appear to play a role in the case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the expert testimonies of Joseph Bozenko and Rebecca Patrick are admissible based on proper disclosure, qualifications, and the reliability of their methods, as per Federal Rules of Evidence 702 and Criminal Procedure 16.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court determined that while the experts were qualified, and their methods were reliable, the government's violation of disclosure rules impacted the defense's ability to challenge the testimonies. The motion was granted in part to address these procedural discrepancies but largely denied, allowing most expert testimony.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're in a science class, and two expert scientists come to show how chemicals can make dangerous drugs. However, the teacher forgot to tell you everything they were going to show, which made it hard to prepare your questions.

The Court easily conclude s that Bozenko and Patrick are qualified \nand that their opinions fit the facts of th is case and are grounded in reliable methods \nand principles. The Court’s adjudication of Bressi’s Motion is only made difficult \nby the Government’s repeated failures to comply with the Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure and Orders of this Court. While the Court largely denies Bressi’s Motion, \nthe Court finds that the Government’s nonc ompliance denied Bressi fair notice and \nopportunity to challenge certain opini ons and grants his Motion in part. \nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND On June 27, 2019, a grand jury i ndicted Defendants Anthony Bressi, \nDamonico Henderson, and Terr y Harris, charging them collectively with conspiracy \nto manufacture, distribute, a nd possess with intent to dist ribute controlled substances Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 350     Filed 07/03/24     Page 1 of 372 (Count I), and individually with possession w ith the intent to distribute controlled \nsubstances (Bressi – Count II; Hende rson – Count III; Harris – Count IV).1 The \nDefendants pleaded not guilty.2 Bressi’s Daubert Motion is the second such Motion. \nBressi’s co-Defendant, Damonico Henderson filed the first Daubert Motion in July \n2023.3 In support of his Motion, wh ich his co-Defendants joined,4 Henderson argued \nthat the Government’s expert witn ess disclosures of September 26, 20225 were \ndeficient under recently-ame nded Federal Rule of Cr iminal Procedure 16. Though \nthe Court agreed with Henderson that the disclosures were deficient, it found that \nprecluding the Government from introduci ng expert testimony a ltogether was too \nharsh a sanction under the circumstances— in particular, that the Government’s \ndisclosure was filed before the amendments to Rule 16 went into effect and that \nDefendants had been no more diligent in seeking relief.6 In lieu of granting the \nMotion, the Court required the Government to file new expert disclosures which \ncomported with the re quirements of Rule 16.7  \nOn December 1, 2023, the Government  filed a new Rule 16 disclosure \nidentifying Rebecca Patrick, Joseph Boze nko, Brandy Pulfer, Jo seph Stephens, and \n \n1  Indictment, Doc. 16. \n2  Doc. 22 (Harris Not Guilty Plea); Doc. 28 (Bressi Not Guilty Plea); Doc. 38 (Henderson Not \nGuilty Plea). \n3  First Daubert  Mot., Doc. 291. \n4  Bressi Notice of Joinder, Doc. 295; Harris Notice of Joinder, Doc. 296. \n5  First Expert Disclosures, Doc. 231. \n6  See generally  Nov. 3, 2023 Mem.

Concerned that \nthe Government intended to rely on the a bove boilerplate, “cat ch-all” language and \nits “continuing discovery obligations” to elicit improperly disclosed testimony at \ntrial, the Court granted Defendants’ Motion for a Daubert Hearing.11 The Court also \ndiscussed the Government’s disclosure of John Orlando, who would testify \nregarding cell-site location analysis. Th e Government suggested that Orlando’s \ntestimony would not rise to the level of expert tes timony, and that Orlando was \nincluded for the purpose of giving notice of his testimony “to the ex tent it relates to \nany special skill and training he may possess.”12 While the impulse to be \n \n8  Second Expert Disclosures, Doc. 306.

Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 350     Filed 07/03/24     Page 3 of 374 overinclusive is understandable, Rule 16 requires the disclosure of “a complete  \nstatement of all opinions that the gove rnment will elicit from the witness.”13 Thus, \ngeneral boilerplate or “expert-lit e” disclosures are of limited utility.14 On the \ncontrary, they inject uncertainty and ra ise the specter that improperly disclosed \ntestimony will be elicited at trial. \nTo resolve any uncertainty and the specific concerns identified by the \nDefendants, the Court held a Daubert hearing on April 22, 2024. Prior to the hearing, \nBressi’s co-Defendants pleaded guilty to Count I of the Indictment.15 Therefore, only \nBressi participated in the hearing.  \nAt the outset, Bressi and the Governme nt informed the Court that they had \nagreed to stipulations regarding the tes timonies of Brandy Pulfer, Joseph Stephens \nand Erik Carpenter, who would be replaci ng Krystal Watts. As to Stephens, Bressi \nobjected to the extent that he would testif y that Aniline, which he identified through \ntesting of physical evidence recovered by la w enforcement, is a precursor to the \nmanufacture of fentanyl. However, the Gove rnment represented that Stephens would \nnot testify that Aniline is a precursor, only that his testing found that he identified \nAniline among the evidence rec overed from the lab. With that understanding, the \nparties stipulated to the admissibility of  Stephens’ testimony regarding his testing \n \n13  Fed. R. Crim.

As to Watts, the Government informed the Court \nthat she had subsequently relocated and w ould be replaced by a different witness. \nBressi, pending receipt of disclosures of th e Carpenter’s testimony, stipulated to its \nadmissibility to the extent that it was consistent with Watts’ report. \nAs only Bressi’s challenges to Bo zenko and Patrick remain, only those \nwitnesses testified at the hearing.16 The Court invited the par ties to submit, and they \ndid submit supplemental briefing regarding issues raised at the hearing.17 Bressi’s \nMotion is ripe for disposition.

Certain financial transactions \nmade by Bressi which involved business accounts Bressi set up for SHIVA and his \npersonal account—transactions which appeared to be structured to avoid bank \nreporting requirements and transactions involving large amounts of cash—arose \nsuspicion at the FBI and Bressi’s bank. \nThe FBI officially opened its investigation into Bressi, his co-Defendants, and \nSHIVA’s business in 2018. According to SHIVA’s website, the company was \ninvolved in “Tech Developments” and “C onsulting & Custom Solutions.” SHIVA \nclaimed to be “in the process of devel oping some world-changing technologies in \nfields as diverse as energy, medicine, beverages, communicati ons, entertainment, \naerospace, transportation, chemistry, robo tics, artificial intelligence, and defense.” \nSHIVA described itself as “Sci-Fi Realized ” because “many of its products do just \nthat—turn science ficti on into science fact.” \nIn truth, SHIVA was long on fiction a nd short on fact. In reviewing SHIVA’s \nbusiness banking records, the FBI f ound that SHIVA had been purchasing \nequipment and chemicals consistent with  the production of illegal drugs. Though \nmany of the chemicals had legitimate uses , the FBI found that SHIVA had purchased \n“3-Methyl-1-phenethylpiperi din-4-one,” which Joseph Bo zenko, a forensic chemist \nwith the Drug Enforcement Administration stated had no legitimate, licit use.19 \n \n19  Doc. 297-1, at 8. Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 350     Filed 07/03/24     Page 6 of 377 Following these discoveries, in Novemb er 2018, the FBI c onducted a “trash \npull” from a dumpster on SHIVA’s commercial property. Inside the trash bags, the \nFBI found, among other items, two empty gl ass bottles of the chemical “Aniline” \nand a white laboratory coat stained with residue of Aniline and 4-Anilinopiperidine. \nBozenko and an FBI chemist informed the i nvestigatory team th at these chemicals \nare precursors used in the synthesi s of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues,20 and that \nthe identification of the two chemicals on th e lab coat were convincing evidence of \nfentanyl synthesis. \nAfter several months of further inves tigation, the Government sought and \nobtained a search warrant for the SHIVA property and Bressi’s home in Danville, \nPennsylvania. Pennsylvania State Police forensic chemist Rebecca Patrick \nparticipated in the search of SHIVA. Accompanied by nine state troopers and a \nsecond forensic chemist, Patrick don ned a “Level A ensemble”—a fully \nencapsulated suit with a breathing apparatus— to prevent the inhalation or absorption \nthrough the skin of chemicals which could be present at a suspected clandestine drug \nlaboratory.21 \nFirst, Patrick and other law enforcem ent personnel on the scene did an initial \nassessment and attempted to stop any active reactions that were occurring.22 Then \n \n20  See id.  at 9 (Bozenko emailing FBI agent Tim O’Malley  that Aniline is used to make fentanyl). \n21  Daubert  Hr’g.

CHALLENGED TESTIMONY A. Joseph Bozenko \n1. Qualifications \nJoseph Bozenko is a Senior Research Chem ist with the with the United States \nDrug Enforcement Administration’s special testing and research laboratory, where \nhe has held various similar roles for twenty-four years.\n32 He has been “Clandestine \nLab Certified” by the DEA since 1999.33 He is also affiliated with the DEA Special \nOperations Division where he is a scientif ic advisor to transnational investigations \nfor over twenty U.S. government agencies.34 Bozenko has a bachelor’s and a \nmaster’s degree in chemistry.35 He also has participated in ongoing professional \ntraining, both as a student and as an instructor, including as a professor in \nchemistry.36 \n2.

Mr. \nBozenko will testify that he knows of no licit uses for 3-methyl-1- \nphenethylpiperidin-4-one.”39 \nAt the hearing, the Government emphasized its position that Bozenko’s \n“testimony is more along the lines of expert facts, rather than expert opinions.”40 The \nGovernment suggests that such “expert fact s”—i.e., that certain chemicals are used \nin the manufacture of fentanyl—are not opi nions, but “specialized scientific fact.”41 \nThe Government concedes that  if Bozenko testified “when al l of these three or four \nor a dozen chemicals are together, in my opinion, this [more strongly] suggests the \nmanufacture of fentanyl than simply the pr esence of Aniline, which could be used \n \n37  Second Expert Disclosures at 7-8, 10. \n38  Id. at 8-9. \n39  Id. at 9. \n40  Tr. 10:5-7. \n41  Id. at 196:1-19.

Rebecca Patrick \n1. Qualifications \nRebecca Patrick is a Forensic Scientist 2 with the Pennsylvania State Police, \nwhere she has been a forensic scientist for twenty-two years.45 She is also a \nClandestine Lab Team Coordinator.46 In that position, which she has held for fifteen \nyears, she is tasked with responding to  suspected clandestine drug lab operations, \nconducting training sessions, and preparing written reports  detailing the results of \nher testing on evidence.47 She is also a Hazmat Specialist on the Lehigh County \nSpecial Operations team where she responds to area hazardous material \n \n42  Id. at 195:20-25. \n43  Second Expert Disclosures at 10. \n44  Tr. 194:18-25. \n45  Id. 111:1-5; Second Expert  Disclosures at 3. \n46  Second Expert Disclosu res at 4; Tr. 111:19-25. \n47  Second Expert Disclosu res at 4; Tr. 111:19-25.

Untimely Disclosures  \nAt the outset of its direct examinati on of Bozenko during the hearing, the \nGovernment notified the Court that Bo zenko would testify that he relied upon a \npublication of the United Nations  Office on Drugs and Crime, Clandestine \nManufacture of Substances U nder International Control .82 As described by the \nUnited Nations, Clandestine Manufacture , also referred to by the parties as “the UN \nBook,” “has been prepared as a working reference t ool for use by national law \nenforcement authorities and personnel of drug testing laboratories, drawing on \nreviews supplied by national authorities as well as on available literature.”83 The \nmanual “is guarded by the DEA and is not su itable for general di ssemination” as it, \namong other things, “describes how to ma ke drugs” including, as relevant here, \n“recipes for how to make fentanyl.”84 Accordingly, though the Government had “no \nobjection to [Bressi’s counsel] reviewing this book, even reviewing this book over \n \n79  Doc. 348, Section II. \n80  Id. at 6-8. \n81  Id. at 9-11. \n82  E.g., Tr. 41:8-42:3. \n83  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Clandestine Manufacture of Substances Under \nInternational Control  (accessed June 28, 2024), https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/scientists\n/clandestine-manufacture-of-substances-under-international-control_new.html. \n84  Tr. 44:1-8. Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 350     Filed 07/03/24     Page 17 of 3733 C. Reliability \nBressi also raises a number of objections  to the reliability of Patrick’s methods \nand their application. Those challenges fall in to three categories; 1) a failure to test \ncertain substances recovered from SHIVA; 2) the reliability of the testing that was \nperformed; and 3) Patrick’s reliance on a drug yield calcula tor. The Court addresses \neach in turn. \n1. Failure to Test \nBressi faults Patrick for failing to test certain items recovered from the Shiva \nlab.145 Patrick testified that a full, unopened c ontainers of certain chemicals were not \ntested to confirm their contents.146 Insofar that Patrick me rely relied upon the label \nof a container to determine its contents, sh e is not offering the sort of opinion which \nis subject to a Daubert  analysis. One need not be  a chemist or know what 4-\npiperidone is to understand that a contai ner labeled “4-piperidone” likely contains \n4-piperidone. To the extent that Patrick th en offers any expert opinions based on the \nrecovery from the lab of 4-piperidone, or any other substances identified by the label of their containers, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that those \nopinions reflect a reliable application of th e relevant principles and methods to the \nfacts of the case. \n \n145  Id. at 9 ¶¶ 1-2. \n146  Tr. 184:3-186:16. Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 350     Filed 07/03/24     Page 33 of 3734 Bressi can certainly argue to a jury that  the sealed containers did not contain \nthe substances advertised on their labels. He can then implore the jury to reject any \nconclusions based on the presence of the improperly identified substances. But those \nare arguments to be presented to the jury at trial, not the Court on a Daubert motion.  \n2. Methods of Testing \nBressi offers two arguments in support of his position that Patrick’s methods \nfor determining the quantity, yield, and com position of the substances she tested are \nunreliable: 1) Patrick “was unable to expl ain the volume, quantity or reason for the \nratios selected in the mixture of the st andards”; and 2) sh e “does not know the \nconcentration of the standard substances she is running as controls, or even the size \nof the test tubes she is using to run samples.”147   \nDuring the hearing, Patrick explained that samples were tested in a gas \nchromatography and mass spectrometry machine.148 The results were then compared \nto a “library sample,” or the results from a known substance.149 There are different \nlibraries available to which chemists can compare samples.150 Here, that also \nincludes the Bethlehem library, or  the library for Patrick’s lab.151 In cases where a \n \n147  Doc. 348, at 9 ¶¶ 3-4. \n148  Tr. 117:13-19. \n149  Id. at 132:20-133:2. \n150  Id. at 133:8-19. \n151  Id.

Yield Calculator \nBressi suggests that Patrick’s testimony regarding the potential yield is neither \nreliable nor reproducible  because she cannot verify the accuracy of the tool that she \nutilized to determine the purported yield.157 Bressi cites to no authority, nor is the \nCourt aware of any, which requires an e xpert to independently verify or be \n \n152  Id. at 120:1-19. \n153  Id. at 187:24-8. \n154  Id. at 188:9-189:14. \n155  Id. at 188:15-19. \n156  Id. at 188:23-189:5. \n157  Doc. 348, at 10.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   Plaintiff Thierry Rignol, an MBA student at Yale School of Management, used generative AI in violation of exam rules, leading to an investigation by the Honor Committee. Despite Rignol's denial and failure to cooperate by not providing requested documents, the Committee found that he had used AI and imposed a penalty of an \"F\" and a one-year suspension. Rignol sought a preliminary injunction to avoid irreparable harm from suspension and to continue his studies, but the court denied the motion due to a lack of evidence of such harm.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The central legal issue is whether Rignol demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm that justifies a preliminary injunction against the disciplinary actions imposed by Yale University.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that Rignol failed to demonstrate irreparable harm that would justify granting a preliminary injunction. Consequently, his motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you broke your school's rules during an important test by using a robot to get answers — you weren't supposed to do that! When the school found out, they told you that you would have to leave school for a year and get a failing grade for that test. You asked a judge to let you stay in school and not have a failing grade right away, while your fight with the school happened in court. But the judge said \"no\" because you didn't prove that being out of school would harm you in a way that couldn’t be fixed later.",

After a teaching assistant flagged one of his exams in the spring of 2024, SOM \nadministrators conducted an investigation to determine whether Rignol violated examination \nrules by using generative artificial intelligence (“AI”). In the course of its investigation, \nSOM  determined  that Rignol  was not forthcoming during the investigation and did use AI ; \nSOM penalized Rignol by issuing him an F in the course and suspending him from classes \nfor one year.  \nRignol subsequently sought  a preliminary injunction that would reinstate him as a \nstudent in good standing at SOM such that he could graduate with his classmates in the class \nof 2025 this spring. Because I conclude that Rignol has failed to make the threshold showing of irreparable harm, I deny Rignol’s motion for a preliminary injunction. Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 1 of 262 I. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Background \n1. Rignol Enrolls at SOM \nThierry Rignol is an entrepreneur and investor. Defs.’ Ex. F at 1 , ECF No. 43-1. In his \nLinkedIn profile, which Defendants attach to their memorandum, Rignol describes himself as \nthe founder of a “technology driven real estate and hospitality company” headquartered in Mexico and operating throughout the Americas. Defs.’ Ex. F  at 1, 4. Rignol’s profile says his \nfirm had 28 full-time workers as of the end of 2020. In addition to managing his own firm, Rignol serves as a director on the boards of several private  enterprises . Id. at 4.  Rignol is a \nFrench national authorized to live and work in the United States on an investor visa. Compl. \n¶¶ 15, 72, ECF No. 1. \nRignol enrolled in SOM’s MBA for Executives program in July 2023. Compl. ¶ 31. \nThe MBA for Executives (“EMBA”) program is oriented towards professionals who have \nadvanced significantly in their careers. Defs.’ Ex. A ¶ 2, ECF No. 41-2 (“Tsung Aff.”). \nEMBA students continue to work full- time while attending classes every other weekend. \nTsung Aff. ¶ 4. The EMBA curriculum requires regular in- person attendance, together with \nsignificant collaboration with colleagues on a student’s Learning Team. Tsung Aff. ¶¶ 7- 9. \nIn the spring of 2024, Rignol enrolled in Sourcing and Managing Funds, a core \ncurriculum class taught by Professors Rouwenhorst and Thomas. Defs.’ Ex. E ¶ 3, ECF No. 41-6 (“Rouwenhorst Decl.”). The final exam for the course instructed students that “You are \nnot allowed to browse online resources or use AI tools (like ChatGPT) for formulating \nanswers.” Defs.’ Ex. I at 2, ECF No. 41-10 (emphasis in original). Students were allowed to Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 2 of 263 complete the exam under self- timed conditions at any time during the two- week exam period \nin May 2024. Id.  \nRignol’s exam was flagged by a teaching assistant on June 10, 2024. Defs.’ Ex. J, \nECF No. 41 -11. The teaching assistant noted that Rignol’s exam, “one of the highest \nscoring,” had “clocked in at 30 pages whereas almost all others were under 20.” While \nconceding it was theoretically possible to produce  such an exam under timed conditions, the \nteaching assistant said that Rignol’s exam “length stood out relative to the others.” Defs.’ Ex. \nJ. Rouwenhorst investigated further and shared his initial findings with  Wendy Tsung, an \nSOM administrator responsible for overseeing the EMBA program. Defs.’ Ex. K , ECF No. \n41-12. In his email to Tsung on June 11, 2024, Rouwenhorst said he had  “serious concerns \nabout violation of the exam rules, such as improper use of AI.” He noted that certain \n“answers to essay type questions on the exam score high on the likelihood of being AI \ngenerated using ChatGPTzero as a detection tool” and “[a]t least one answer shows \nsubstantial overlap with answers to simple prompts on ChatGPT.” Id.  Rouwenhorst asked \nthat Tsung “refer this to the Honor Committee for further investigation.” Id.  \n2. SOM’s Honor Code and Honor Committee  \nSOM’s Honor Code requires that students adhere to the “highest standards of \nacademic integrity.” Defs.’ Ex. C  at 7, ECF No. 41- 4 (“Bulletin ”).1 The Honor Committee is \na group of students and faculty convened to investigate “instances of academic infractions.” \nId. at 8. By custom, a n Honor Committee investigation begins when a member of the SOM \n \n1 I cite throughout to the pagination set by ECF rather tha n any internal numbering appeari ng on \nthe parties ’ exhibits or memoranda.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 3 of 264 community refers a matter to the C ommittee chair. Id . at 9. The C ommittee chair conducts an \ninitial review to determine if the offense “would be of sufficient seriousness to warrant the \nattention of the committee.” If the chair determines the conduct is sufficiently serious, they \nmust notify the student and advise the student of how the Honor Committee will conduct its \ninvestigation. Id.  at 9, 10. The Bulletin requires the following be communicated to the \nstudent:  \n[T]he student will be directed to review the Committee Policies and Procedures \nto apprise the student of the rights:  (a) to appear before the committee, (b) to be \naccompanied by any member of the university community to act as the student’s adviser,\n2 (c) to examine any and all written materials being provided to the \ncommittee as soon as possible, and ordinarily at least forty- eight hours in \nadvance of the meeting, so that the student may have ample opportunity to \nquestion or refute them.  \nId. at 9.  The Honor Committee will notify the student of the membership of the C ommittee \nso that the student may request recusals of members the student believes to be “ prejudiced ” \nagainst them. Id.  at 11. The chair may accept or refuse a student’s request to recuse a \nCommittee member.  If a request to recuse is rejected, the following procedure must be \nfollowed:  \nA decision of the chair not to recuse the challenged member will be \ncommunicated to the student, who may within one day after receiving the notice \nappeal the decision to the cognizant academic dean of the relevant academic \nprogram. The cognizant academic dean’s decision to deny or grant the appeal \nof a conflict of interest will be final.  \nId. \n \n2 The Bulletin notes that the student adviser is “not an advocate, but rather a source of support” \nwho “may help the student in preparing for the meeting with the Honor Committee and may \naccompany the student to the meeting.” Id. at 10.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 4 of 265 The Honor Committee is “empowered to take the following actions and may impose \nother sanctions of intermediate severity: exoneration, warning (verbal or written), probation, \nmandatory F in course (for academic infractions), suspension of one or more terms + \nmandatory F in course, expulsion.” Id.  at 9-10. \nA student dissatisfied with Honor Committee proceedings has two options for \nadministrative review within SOM. First, a student may meet with the dean responsible for \noverseeing their academic program to lodge  complaints regarding “procedural irregularity or \nprejudice.” The dean must  then “investigate the objection and may remand the matter to the \ncommittee to correct the procedural irregularity or to re -deliberate after disqualifying the \nmember or members found to be prejudiced.” Id. A  student also has the option to appeal the \nseverity of penalty to the Faculty Review Board. Id. The Review Board is comprised of the \nacademic dean overseeing the relevant academic program and two faculty members who did \nnot participate in Honor Committee proceedings. Id.  The Review Board will “judge the \nappropriateness of the punishment assessed by the committee, assuming the correctness of \nthe committee’s finding of a violation.” Id.  “The appeal of the full committee decision to the \nFaculty Review Board can result in a sanction more severe than the one originally imposed.” \nId. \n3. Rignol’s Appearance  Before the Honor Committee  \nProfessor Choi was chair of the Honor Committee in the summer and fall of 2024. \nDefs .’ Ex. D  ¶¶ 1, 7, ECF No. 41- 5 (“Choi Aff. ”). After Tsung shared Rouwenhorst’s email \ndescribing Rignol’s potential academic misconduct with him, Choi undertook an initial \ninvestigation to decide whether Rignol’s conduct was sufficiently serious to merit referral to the full Honor Committee. Id. ¶ 8. As part of that initial review , Choi sought to examine the Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 5 of 266 native file of the document Rignol used to turn in the PDF containing his exam answer s. Id. ¶ \n9. \nSOM administrators Tsung (Assistant Dean of the EMBA program) and Sherilyn \nScully (SOM Dean of S tudents) met with Rignol on July 24, 2024, to discuss the \ninvestigation into Rignol’s use of AI. Defs.’ Ex. Y, ECF No. 41- 26. Rignol says that Tsung \nand Scully used the meeting to pressure him to confess to using AI.  Rignol Decl . ¶ 20, Feb. \n25, 2025, ECF No. 17. Rignol asserts that the SOM administrators threatened that, if he did \nnot confess to misconduct, the Honor Committee would impose a harsher disciplinary \nsanction, which could lead to his expulsion from SOM and cancelation of his student visa . \nDefs.’ Ex. Y; Compl. ¶ 72.3 Tsung denies that she and Scully attempted to coerce Rignol —\nrather, she says that they used the meeting to review “the Honor Committee’s policy of leniency when students accept responsibility for actions” and preview the “ immig ration \nconsequences  associated with any discipline imposed by the Committee because we wanted \nto ensure that [Rignol] was fully informed.” Tsung Aff. ¶ 12.  \nTsung wrote to Rignol on July 30, 2024, noting that Choi was “requesting that you \nsubmit to us the word version of your submission version of the Sourcing and Managing Funds exam.” Defs.’ Ex. P , ECF No. 41- 17. Rignol did not respond. See id. Tsung reiterated \nthe same request  to Rignol on August 7, 2024. Id.  Rignol again failed to respond. Id.  \nOn August 10, 2024, Choi wrote to Rignol directly. He said:   \nI have received a complaint that you violated the Honor Code while taking the \nSourcing and Managing Funds final exam. Through Dean Wendy Tsung, I have \ntwice asked you to send us the Microsoft Word file that produced that  PDF file \nyou submitted for the exam. I am now asking you directly. I remind you that \n \n3 The Complaint notes that Rignol has an investor visa, not a student visa. Compl. ¶ 72. Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 6 of 267 when a student has been found by the Honor Committee to have lied or not been \nforthcoming with the Committee, the most common punishment is permanent \nexpulsion from Yale.  \nChoi Aff . ¶ 10. Rignol again failed to reply. Id. On August 12, 2024, Choi wrote to Rignol \nagain. Id.; see also  Defs.’ Ex. Q at 2, ECF No. 41- 18. Rignol’s first response to Choi came \nfour days later on Friday, August 16, 2024. Defs.’ Ex. Q at 2. Rignol said:  \nI’m confused. Until now, Wendy and Dean Scully have told me that this matter \nhas not been formally referred to the Honor Committee. Further, I was told that \nyou had already received a copy of the submitted exam. I am of course happy \nto comply with the SOM policies at all times.  \nId. Choi responded:  \nThe first step in the process is for the chair of the Honor Committee to make a \ndetermination of whether the case will proceed to the Honor Committee. This \ncan involve some gathering of evidence. That is where we are right now. I have \nthe PDF file that you submitted. I am asking you to send us the Word file from \nwhich the PDF was produced. You seem to be weighing whether you will \ncooperate or not. It’s your choice, but if history is a guide, failure to cooperate \nwould be viewed by the Honor Committee as an extraordinary violation of the \nHonor Code.  \nId. Later that same day, Choi wrote to Rignol to inform Rignol that he had expanded his \ninvestigation to consider “deliverables you submitted for other courses.”  Defs.’ Ex. R , ECF \nNo. 41- 19. On August 19, 2024, Choi requested that Rignol send to him “ the Microsoft Word \nfile that was used to produce the PDF you submitted for the Investor final exam.” Defs.’ Ex. \nS, ECF No. 41- 20. Choi noted that this was “in addition to my previous request that you send \nme the Word file used to produce the PDF you submitted for the Sourcing and Managing Funds \nfinal exam.” Id. Rignol never responded to either request for documents. Choi Aff . ¶ 14. Choi \nsays that Rignol was the first student to decline to produce documents in his ten years serving on the Honor Committee. Id.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 7 of 268 After this initial investigation, Choi referred Rignol to the full Honor Committee. Id. ¶ \n15. Choi relied in part on the many similarities between Rignol’s answers to exam questions \nand those produced when Choi submitted exam questions to ChatGPT. Id.  Choi felt that \nRignol’s refusal to provide requested documents provided further grounds to suspect Rignol \ncheated on the exams. Id. \nTsung wrote to Rignol on September 8, 2024, notifying him that Choi had referred an \ninquiry to the full Honor Committee. Defs.’ Ex. W at 2- 3, ECF No. 41- 24. Tsung noted that \nthe Committee would investigate whether Rignol “improperly utilized AI on the final exam \nin the course.” Id. at 3.  Tsung told Rignol that he was required to attend a meeting with the \nHonor Committee, directed  Rignol to consult the  Bulletin for a description of how the \nCommittee would conduct its activities, and shared a link for where Rignol could find a \ndirectory of Committee members should he decide to seek recusals.  Id. (Tsung noted that the \nlist of Committee members would be updated soon with some new members). I d. Tsung \nwrote that the meeting was tentatively scheduled to take place on October 4, 2024. Id . \nRignol responded on September 9, 2024. Id . at 2 . Rignol asked if the meeting could \nbe rescheduled to November, noting he would be out of the country on October 4  for his \nwedding . Id. Rignol copied his attorneys in this email communication. Id.  Tsung responded \non September 12, 2024, confirming that the Committee would meet on November 8, 2024. Defs.’ Ex. X at 3, ECF No. 41 -25. Tsung wrote to Rignol on October 14, 2024, to share the \nevidence that the Committee planned to review in advance of its meeting on November 8. \nShe noted these “materials contain a memo authored by Professor Rouwenhorst referring the \ncase as well as the sup porting documentation he provided and email exchanges with the \ncommittee chair.” Id. at 2. Tsung asked that, if Rignol sought to provide a written response, Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 8 of 269 that he share it with her by October 30 so that she could distribute it to the entire C ommittee. \nId. \nRignol sought recusals beginning on November 3, 2024. In a message copying one of \nhis attorneys, he requested that Scully —the former dean of students and an ex officio  \nmember of the Committee —be recused from participation. Defs.’ Ex. Y. Choi granted this \nrequest. Choi Aff. ¶ 19. Rignol responded on November 4, 2024, asserting that Scully and \nTsung had previously represented to him that the Committee would include seven students \nwho had taken the same Sourcing and Managing Funds exam as Rignol. Defs.’ Ex. Z, ECF No. 41- 27. Choi responded, noting that Tsung and Scully disputed Rignol’s recollection of \ntheir meeting , and reiterating that the Committee would follow the procedures described in \nthe Bulletin . Choi informed Rignol that the only proper grounds for seeking recusal was if a \nCommittee member “would be prejudiced in your case.” Id. On  November 5, after Rignol \nasked to recuse every member of the Committee who had reviewed evidence in his case or \nhad participated in the initial review of evidence, Choi declined, saying he felt the  recusal \nrequests  were “baseless .” Given the evidence had been shared with C ommittee members in \nadvance of the hearing that was occurring in three  days , Rignol’s requests would have \nrequired recusing the entire Committee and its chair. Choi Aff. ¶ 19.  \nThe Honor Committee met to consider Rignol’s conduct on November 8, 2024. Id. ¶ \n20. Notwithstanding Tsung’s instruction that Rignol submit any written materials by October \n30, Defs.’ Ex. X, on the day of his hearing Rignol sought and was granted leave from Choi to \npresent written documents describing the unreliability of ChatGPTzer o and other AI \ndetection tools . Choi Aff. ¶ 21. At the hearing, Rignol continued to deny that he had used AI \non his exam. Id.  Rignol told Committee members that he had ignored Choi’s emails Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 9 of 2610 requesting Microsoft Word copies of his exams because he had written  the exam in Apple \nPages , not Word. Id. ¶ 22.4 Rignol says that he left the meeting in a state of considerable \ndistress. Compl. ¶ 109. Following the meeting, Tsung contacted Rignol to ask that he send \nthe Pages document that he said at the hearing he used to produce the PDF. Tsung Aff . ¶ 14. \nRignol produced this document while the Committee was still meeting.  Id. Rignol also \nrequested to be excused from attending class that afternoon. Compl. ¶ 109.  \nAfter Rignol left  the hearing , the Honor Committee began deliberating. Choi says that \nhe and other Honor Committee members found Rignol’s responses to their questions at the hearing  “incredible .” Choi Aff . ¶ 22. In particular, Choi says: “ The Honor Committee was \nstunned by [Rignol ’s] disruptive action of ignoring the request to submit any documents he \nwished us to consider at least twenty-four hours before the meeting, his prior failure to produce the electronic files requested, and his incredible explanation for why he had not \ndone so. It concluded that [Rignol’s] actions were unprecedented.”  Id. ¶ 24. As the \nCommittee deliberated, Choi reviewed the Pages file that Rignol had shared and researched \nwhether the file contained its editing history. Id.  ¶ 25. Choi determined that Pages does not \ntransmit the editing history of a file when the file is shared via email, but that the editing history would be available on the hard drive of the computer used to write the exam. Id.  In \nlight of this, approximately 90 minutes after Rignol had left the hearing , Tsung called Rignol \nto ask that he return with his laptop. Id. ¶ 26. Rignol responded that he was unavailable to \n \n4 Pages is a word processing program that allows users to sync documents across their Apple \ndevices.

Choi  then  called Rignol multiple times to ask him to return but Rignol \ndid not answer his phone. Choi Aff . ¶ 26. Choi said that the Committee “concluded that \n[Rignol’s]  refusal to return was another delay tactic.” Id.  \nThe Honor Committee decided not to wait to conduct a second meeting with Rignol . \nIt concluded that Rignol had not been forthcoming  with the Committee . Choi Aff. ¶ 28. The \ndecision was “based largely on [Rignol’s]  unprecedented refusal to produce the documents it \nhad requested—a decision that . . . the Committee concluded had no justification —and his \nrefusal to return to the Committee.” Id.  It did not reach the issue of whether Rignol had \nindeed used AI on his Sourcing and Managing Funds exam because it determined that \nRignol’s “decision to not be forthcoming had become the primary issue.” Id. ¶ 29. The \nHonor Committee wrote to Rignol later that evening to notify him that it had determined he \nhad not been forthcoming and that the penalty for this finding would be a one -year \nsuspension from SOM. Defs.’ Ex. BB, ECF No. 41- 29. \nOn November 14, 2024, Rignol wrote to Tsung asking when his grade in Sourcing \nand Managing Funds would be released. Defs.’ Ex. CC at 4, ECF No. 41- 30. Tsung \nresponded:  \nI don’t know when the faculty will be meeting this week but like I said, they do \nplan to meet and your grade should be updated next week. Your appeal to the \nFaculty Review Board is for the severity of the one year suspension penalty and \nnot the findings of  the Honor Committee decision. There is no grade penalty \noutcome from the Honor Committee decision.  \nId. at 4.  \n Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 11 of 2612 4. Proceedings Before the Faculty Review Board  \nOn November 15, 202 4, Rignol appealed the one -year suspension imposed by the \nHonor Committee to Deputy Dean Anjani Jain and the Faculty Review Board. See Defs.’ Ex. \nDD, ECF No. 41- 31. Rignol asserted that he had been forthcoming. Id. at 5. In addition, \nrelying in part on an email from Tsung where she disclosed that there had been only one \nother student penalized in the past three years for not being forthcoming, and this penalty \nwas in connection with a determination that the student had falsified attendance records , \nRignol asserted that his discipline was the first instance where the Honor Committee had \nissued a standalone penalty for not being forthcoming without addressing the merits of the \nunderlying charge . Id. Rignol asserted that “not being forthcoming” has “always been an \nenhancement factor in sentencing, not a basis for the punishment in and of itself.” Id. at 4. He \nmaintained that the penalty in the case “incentivizes students to falsely confess in order to \nreceive a reduced penalty.” Id. at 5.  \nDeputy Dean Jain wrote to Rignol on November 19, 2024, to inform Rignol that the \nFaculty Review Board had denied Rignol’s appeal.  Defs.’ Ex. EE, ECF No. 41- 32. Jain  also \ncommunicated the following:  \nSeparate from the FRB decision, I wish to let you know that I am asking \nProfessor James Choi and the Honor Committee to continue deliberating the \ncomplaint of violation of the examination rules in the course MGT 423E: \nSourcing and Managing Funds to determine whether you violated SOM’s \nHonor Code.  \nId.  \nPursuant to Jain’s  direction , the Honor Committee met again on November 21, 2024. \nChoi Aff. ¶ 31. Rignol was not invited to appear again before the Honor Committee. See  Rignol \nDecl. ¶ 24 , Feb. 25, 2025. In this second meeting, the Honor Committee determined that Rignol Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 12 of 2613 had violated examination rules by using AI. Choi Aff. ¶ 31. Choi says the Honor Committee \nrelied on Rignol’s decision not to be forthcoming in reaching its decision that he used AI. In \nparticular, “[t]he Honor Committee felt that [Rignol’s]  refusal to provide the documents could \nonly be explained by [Rignol]  attempting to hide misconduct in light of the fact that the only \nalternative explanation [Rignol]  had offered (regarding his use of Pages instead of Mic rosoft \nWord ) was incredible.” Id. ¶ 33. In addition, in concluding that Rignol used AI, the Honor \nCommittee relied on the “strong similarities between [Rignol]’s response and the ChatGPT \nresponse to one of the Sourcing and Managing Funds exam questions.”  Id. ¶ 34. Choi says that \nthe Honor Committee did not rely on the ChatGPTZero scans produced by Rouwenhorst. Id. \n¶ 32. The Honor Committee reached this decision only with regard to Rignol’s exam in \nSourcing and Managing Funds. Although Choi and Committee members suspected Rignol may also have used AI in completing his exam in the Investor course, “it could not rule out t he \npossibility that the responses at issue were found via permissible Internet searches instead of \nimpermissible AI generation.” Id. ¶ 35. The Honor Committee determined that an appropriate \npenalty would be a mandatory “F” grade in Sourcing and Managing Funds. Id.  ¶ 31. \nRignol appea led this penalty to the Faculty Review Board on December 2, 2024. \nDefs.’ Ex. CC, ECF No. 41- 30. In his appeal, he challenged the ability of the Faculty Review \nBoard to remand his case to the Honor Committee to reach a decision on whether he violated \nexam rules. Id. at 5. Jain responded on behalf of the Faculty Review Board on December 11, \n2024. Defs.’ Ex. GG, ECF No. 41- 34. Jain  informed Rignol that his appeal was denied and \naddressed Rignol’s contention that the Faculty Review Board exceeded its authority in the \nway it handled his firs t appe al. Id.  Jain noted:  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 13 of 2614 Your appeal statement included the claim that the FRB “exceeded the scope of \nits authority” by directing the Honor Committee to continue deliberating and \n“issue findings regarding a new charge ” (emphasis added). I wish to point out \nthat this claim is entirely erroneous. My letter of November 19, 2024 made it \nclear that it was my decision as the cognizant dean, and not the FRB’s, to ask \nthe Honor Committee to continue deliberating the original c omplaint of \nviolation of exam rules, a complaint on which the Honor Committee did not \nreach a decision in its first hearing. This directive to the Honor Committee is \nfully within my authority and responsibility as the cognizant dean. Moreover, \nthis directive did not issue a new charge to the Honor Committee. The only \ncharge the Honor Committee considered in its continued deliberation, and \nissued a ruling on, was the original charge of violating the exam rules in MGT \n423E.  \nId.  \nTsung wrote to Rignol on December 12, 2024, to inform him of the terms of his \nsuspension. Defs.’ Ex. HH, ECF No. 41- 35. Tsung’s letter notes that Rignol ’s suspension \nbegan on November 20, 2024. Id. The letter told Rignol  that he is  “eligible to return to the \nprogram post July 2025 Residency, at a time the academic calendar will allow you to start \nthe balance of your courses” and his “ return date will be determined once the class schedule \nfor the academic year is set.” Id. Tsung informed Rignol that his “suspension will be noted on your transcript while you are on leave and will be removed at your request when you \nreturn.” Id. In closing, Tsung reminded Rignol of the courses he would need to complete in \norder to meet the requirements  for graduation. See id.   \nAt the time of his suspension in November 2024, Rignol had started but not \ncompleted two courses. These courses ended on January 10, 2025. Rignol was withdrawn \nfrom two other courses that started after his suspension began. These courses ended on \nFebruary 8, 2025. Three out of four of these classes are required for Rignol’s graduation. \nNone of the four classes will be offered again until November 2025. Tsung Aff. ¶¶ 20- 23 & \nEx. 3.

On March 31, 2025, I issued a written \ndecision denying Rignol’s motion to proc eed under pseudonym and required him to refile the \ncomplaint under his own name. ECF No. 60.  \nDefendants filed a motion to compel on March 3, 2025, which sought production of  \nRignol’s laptop and other electronic records; Defendants asserted these records were relevant \n \n6 Rignol’s motion is captioned as an ex parte emergency request for TRO  and preliminary \ninjunction, even though it was filed on the public docket  after attorneys for Defendants had \nappeared . Pl.’s Mot . At the status conference on February 27, I told the  parties that I was not \ninclined to grant a  motion for TRO based solely on Rignol’s  brief and affidavit, particularly as I \ncould not determine from Rignol’s filings whether it was feasible for Rignol to complete all \nrequired courses before graduation. Accordingly, Rignol filed a supplemental  declaration  \naddressing his assertion that he could timely complete graduation requirements , Rignol Supp.  \nDecl.,  Feb. 28, 2025, ECF No. 24, and the parties set  an expedited  briefing schedule so that I could \nhear from both sides on Rignol’s entitlement to equitable relief. As the standard for a TRO is \nidentical to that for a preliminary injunction , Kreger v. McCance, 537 F. Supp. 3d 234, 239 (D. \nConn. 2021) , my opinion addressi ng Rignol’s entitlement to a preliminary injunction also resolves \nwhether he is entitled to a TRO.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 16 of 2617 to their anticipated argument that the equities did not favor Rignol because he had in fact \ncheated on his exam . ECF No. 25. Rignol filed a response on March 12, 2025. ECF No. 45. \nAfter hearing argument, the C ourt7 granted in part the motion to compel  on March 19, 2025, \nand required compliance with the order by March 28, 2025. ECF No. 54. I permitted both \nparties to file any supplemental evidence relating to the preliminary injunction motion by \nApril 9, 2025. ECF No. 71. On April 9, 2025, Defendants fi led two supplemental exhibits \nthey assert demonstrate Rignol’s violation of examination rules. ECF Nos. 80, 81.  \nThe parties twice confirmed that they did not request an evidentiary hearing \nconcerning the preliminary injunction. On March 7, 2025, the parties submitted a joint notice \nof their availability for oral argument that stipulated they did not seek an evidenti ary hearing. \nECF No. 32. The parties reiterated that position in response to my questions at a pre -hearing \nstatus conference on April 3, 2025. ECF No. 61. After setting  oral argument for April 7, \n2025, I postponed argument at the request of the parties so they could explore settlement. \nECF No s. 67, 78.8 The parties did not settle, so I heard oral argument on April 11, 2025. ECF \nNo. 83.9  \n \n7 The Honorable Thomas Farrish, United States Magistrate Judge, decided the motion to compel  \non an expedited basis . See ECF No. 26, Order of Referral. I thank Judge Farrish for his prompt \ndecision.  \n8 Settlement talks were convened by the Honorable Robert Spector, United States Magistrate \nJudge. I offer my thanks to  Judge Spector for his efforts  to mediate this dispute, as well as to the \nparties for attempting in good faith to resolve their differences . As I noted at oral argument, the \ndecision to explore settlement has no bearing on how I decide the matter before me, nor do I know  \nwhat positions the parties may have taken during confidential settlement talks.  \n9 At oral argument, Rignol’ s counsel clarified that  his request for a preliminary injunction was \nlimited to his contractual claims. Tr. 15:5- 7, ECF No. 82. Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 17 of 2622 the merits of the case . Furthermore , I reject Rignol’s assertion that  a preliminary injunction is \nnecessary to prevent the damage to his professional reputation he says would occur if \ninvestors, business associates , or classmates  realized that  SOM determined he violated \nexamination rules . A preliminary injunction is not an exoneration, and it would not remedy \nthe fact that this lawsuit  describing Rignol’s disciplinary record  is public record .12  \nRignol’s remaining arguments are unavailing. Rignol says his aspirations to pursue \ngraduate studies at another institution will be frustrated during  the pendency of this litigation \nbecause no institution will accept an applicant whose transcript discloses academic misconduct . Here again Rignol errs in assuming that if he were granted a preliminary \ninjunction it necessarily follows that graduate schools would not learn of the disciplinary proceedings  described in these public filings. Nor has Rignol  articulate d any  concrete or \nimmediate plan to pursue graduate studies. Thus, the harms to his aspirations of postgraduate \nstudies are too speculative to entitle Rignol to a preliminary injunction . See  Doe v. Vassar \nColl., No. 19- cv-9601 (NSR), 2019 WL 6222918, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2019)  \n(“Plaintiff’s broad assertion that he will be harmed by having to explain his suspension to \nemployers or graduate schools is too speculative to warrant injunctive relief, since he has \nidentified no plans to attend any graduate school . . . .”).  Similarly, while Rignol asserts that \n \n12 In his Complaint, Rignol seeks a declaratory judgment declaring , inter alia, that the “sanction \nof a grade of ‘F’ and suspension for one year should be reversed,” his disciplinary  record expunged, \nand any “record of the proceeding regarding the conduct of Plaintiff  is to be permanently \ndestroyed.” Rignol’s entitlement to a declaratory judgment will await a final adjudication in the \ncase. Notably, Rignol’s attorneys insisted repeatedly that whether Rignol violated examination \nrules by using AI is not relevant to the merits of his claims. See, e.g., Reply 4- 5 (asserting that \n“whether Plaintiff used AI is not relevant here”).  Neither  Rignol’s Complai nt nor his request for a \npreliminary injunction seek to prevent Defendants from convening the Honor Committee again  to \nconsider Rignol’s  conduct using the procedural protections to which he says he was entitled and \ndenied.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 22 of 2623 the suspension will undermine  valuable  relationships he has cultivated  with his classmates in \nthe EMBA class of 2025 and cause him to forfeit the one -time honor of serving as class \nmarshal at graduation, I find that those harms— which broadly assert that SOM has \ndiminished the value of Rignol’s degree —are compensable with money damages.13 \nMontague , 2017 WL 4942772, at *3- 4 (holding that not graduating with one’s fellow \nclassmates was a harm compensable with money damages); see also Doe v. Vassar, 2019 \nWL 6222918, at * 6-7 (similar) . \n Finally, Rignol asserts that, “with immigration policies constantly shifting,” the \ninvestor visa that entitles him  to live and work in the United States could be revoked if \nimmigration officials learned that Rignol took three years to complete a two -year course of \nstudy because of a finding of academic misconduct. Pl.’s  Mem. 13. I agree with Defendants \nthat any immigration consequences of Rignol’s suspension are too speculative to entitle him \nto a preliminary injunction. The lawsuit has publicly  disclosed Rignol’s disciplinary record. \nA preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to accommodate Rignol’s  graduation this \nspring would not exonerate Rignol nor prevent public disclosure of his discipline.  \n \n13 At oral argument, Defendants further asserted that, should Rignol return to SOM following his \nsuspension, he is eligible to compete with members of the class of 2026 for the honor of being \nclass marshal . Tr. 60:11 -14. This further supports my finding that forfeiting the honor of being \nclass marshal at graduation in spring 2025 is not an irreparable harm.  Moreover , Rignol’s claim \nthat he would be class marshal if I were to order  Defendants to reinstate him  and remove the F \ngrade for the Sourcing and Managing Funds  course  is speculative. The class marshal honor is \nawarded based on grades received for  certain first year classes, including Sourcing and Managing \nFunds . Tsung Aff. ¶ 35; Rignol  Decl. ¶ 8, Feb. 25, 2025. I do not know what grade  Rignol would \nreceive in the course were his exam  to be graded by his professors , and thus do not  know whether \nRignol  would indeed be entitled to the class marshal honor should he  otherwise manage to satisfy  \nthe requirements for graduation. Id.  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 23 of 2624 I therefore conclude that R ignol has not met his burden of establishing he would be \nirreparably harmed absent a preliminary injunction.  \nB. Equities  \nSince I have concluded that Rignol has failed to show irreparable harm, I need not \nconsider  the other requirements  for issuing a preliminary injunction . Inkel v. Connecticut , \nNo. 3:17 -cv-1400 (MPS), 2019 WL 1230358, at *10 (D. Conn. Mar. 15, 2019) (stating that \nwhere “a plaintiff does not establish irreparable harm, the court need not address the other \nfactors necessary for the issuance of injunctive relief”) (internal quotation marks omit ted). \nHowever, I observe that the balance of equities  does not favor Rignol . \n“Courts ‘must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on \neach party of the granting or withholding of the re quested relief. ’” Winter , 555 U.S. at 24 \n(quoting Amoco Prod. Co . v. Gam bell, 480 U.S. 531, 542 (1987)). I understand that Rignol \nhas been under considerable stress since he was first accused of academic misconduct, and \nthat he has much to lose from delaying graduation. And I acknowledge Rignol’s apparent \nreadiness to complete all the assignments he has missed in order to graduate with his peers this spring. Rignol  Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 10 -11, Feb. 28, 2025, ECF No. 24. But at the same time, \nan injunction requiring Defendants to permit Rignol to graduate this spring would require \nDefendants to “fundamentally alter the Program.” Tsung Aff. ¶ 32.  \nThe parties dispute whether granting an injunction would entail significant hardship \nto Defendants. Rignol maintains this is an insignificant burden. See Tr. 47:4 -6 (“We’re \ntalking about watching some videos and maybe doing a couple of assignments to make up \nfor some lectures that weren ’t recorded.”). But I find Defendants’ description of the manner \nin which the EMBA program would need to be modified, as well as the hardships faced by Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 24 of 2625 administrators and instructors, far more persuasive than Rignol’s assertion that he could \nsubstitute five months of missed graduate instruction for recorded class lectures and make -up \nessays. Tsung explains that “attendance, participation, and group work through Learning \nTeams and otherwise  are core components of the Program” and “[c]lass participation  and \ngroup work are commonly components of student grades.” Tsung Aff. ¶ 31. Tsung observes \nthat adding Rignol to classes underwa y or not even being offered would “dilute the rigor of \nthe classes and require the diversion of substantial time and energy by professors and, with \nrespect to ongoing classes, other students away from their current endeavors.” Id. ¶ 32. I \ncredit Defendants’ assertion that an injunction would place an extraordinary burden on \nRignol’s professors and teaching assistants, who would be responsible for devoting a \nsubstantial amount of time to helping Rignol remediate coursework in classes he has missed.  \nThese hardships were only exacerbated by Rignol’s decision to wait until February \n25, 2025— more than three  months after his suspension began and more than two months \nafter his final appeal to administrators was denied —to apply for injunctive relief . Rignol \nretained counsel as early as September 9, 2024, when he copied several attorneys, one of whom has noticed an appearance in this case, in an email to Tsung and Choi. Defs.’ Ex. W at \n2. Counsel explained at oral argument that the delay is attributable in part to several medical \nemergencies faced by members of Rignol’s legal team. Tr. 81:5- 11. But while  I appreciate \nthat no one can control such occurrences , I cannot ignore the fact that the difficulty of \naccommodating Rignol’s request for an injunction is far higher now than it would have been \nhad Rignol moved for an injunction in December 2024. Indeed, even had I issued an \ninjunction the  day that  Rignol made his request  (and without affording the parties the \nbriefing and argument that they requested ), the balance of equities  would still have favored  Case 3:25-cv-00159-SFR     Document 89     Filed 05/05/25     Page 25 of 2626 Defendants. By February 25, 2025, Rign ol had already missed  four courses entirely  (which \nended in January and February 2025) and  had missed sessions of five  more courses \nunderway . Tsung Aff. ¶¶ 20-26 & Ex. 3. Thus even on that earlier date , accommodating \nRignol would have imposed a substantial hardship on Defendants.  \nI therefore conclude that the equities do not favor an injunction. \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Rignol’s application for a temporary restraining order and \npreliminary injunction , ECF No. 16, is DENIED.  \nThe parties shall confer and submit a Rule 26(f) report describing case management \ndeadlines for the remainder of this action on or before May 19, 2025. \nSO ORDERED.  \n \n \nBridgeport , Connecticut \nMay 5, 2025  \n/s/Sarah F.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion pertains to the case of Alonzo Shipp, who sought to suppress evidence obtained from his Facebook account in connection to a shooting incident. The critical legal issue is whether the search warrant for Shipp's Facebook data was overbroad or lacked specificity. Although the court acknowledged concerns regarding the warrant's breadth, it ultimately denied the motion to suppress based on the \"good faith exception\" to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the search warrant for Shipp's Facebook data was overly broad or lacked sufficient particularity under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that while the warrants raised concerns about their breadth, they fell under the \"good faith exception\" because they were not so facially deficient that the executing officers could not reasonably presume them to be valid. Hence, the motion to suppress the evidence was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine the police need to search your house because they think you did something wrong, but they didn't describe exactly what they're looking for clearly. This can be a problem because they might end up looking through your whole house without a clear reason for doing so. In this case, Alonzo Shipp wanted the court to ignore evidence found from searching his Facebook account because the search was too broad. While the court found the search a bit too wide-ranging, it decided not to throw out the evidence because the police acted in good faith, thinking they were following the rules.",

Alleged Shooting\nOn or about July 20, 2018, an uimamed individual, referred to herein as John Doe, was\nshot in the vicinity of 117-26 147th Street in Queens, New York. (Compl. (Dkt. 1) ^ 2.)

(Id.)\n' Shipp also moved to suppress post-arrest statements and identification evidence, or in the alternative for an\nevidentiary hearing as to whether law enforcement engaged in a deliberate two-step interrogation of Shipp, and a\nWade hearing. CSee Mem. at 5.) Only the motion to suppress the Facebook warrant (the \"Facebook Motion\") is\nbefore the court at this time. (\"See May 23,2019 Order (granting Government's request to address only the\nFacebook Motion at this time in light of the Government's representation that it would not seek to introduce post-\narrest statements or an identification of Shipp if the comt denied his motion to suppress the Facebook warrant).)\n^ The court assumes the parties' familiarity with the factual backgroimd and sets forth here only those facts relevant\nto the Facebook Motion.\n1Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 1 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>Video of the incident shows an individual wearing a white t-shirt pointing an object at\nanother individual. (1413.) A muzzle flash is visible. (Id) The video then shows Doe running\nsouth on 147th Street. (Id.)\nDoe then called 911 and stated in part; \"I've been shot... My shooter's coming to me\nright now... My shooter is on me ... My shooter is right here, my shooter is right here\" and \"I\ndon't want to die Pump, please. Please [inaudible] Pump. Pump. Pump.

The footage\nshows an individual approach Doe, take an item out of his pants or waistband, stand over Doe,\npoint an object at him, and then walk away. (Id) As he walked away, his face was visible on a\nsurveillance camera. (Id) Surveillance video of the incident also appears to show the alleged\nshooter wearing a bandage or similar object on his lower left arm. (Aff. in Supp. of an Appl. for\na Search Warrant (\"Aff.\") (Dkt. 25-1) If 7.)\nOn January 2,2019, Shipp was arrested and charged with possession of the firearm\nalleged to have been used in the July 20,2018 incident.

CSee Facebook Warrant (Dkt. 25-1) at EOF p. 17-\n22.) The warrant application was based on the affidavit of Special Agent Joanna Beck of the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (the \"Affidavit\"). (See Aff. at ECF p. 2-\n16.) The Affidavit set forth the basis for probable cause, which included the following:Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 2 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>• During a 911 call placed during the alleged shooting, the victim can be heard\ncalling the shooter \"Pump.\" (Id.)\n• Surveillance video of the incident on July 20,2018 appear to show the shooter\nwearing a bandage or similar object on his lower left arm. (Id, f 7.)\n• Shipp has admitted that he uses the nickname \"Pump.\" (Id.)\n• Publicly accessible photos, including a profile picture, on a Facebook accoimt\nbelonging to a user calling himself \"Sts Pistol Tony\" appear to be photos of\nShipp, indicating that the account may belong to Shipp. (Id, ^ 9.)\n• Individuals wish the account holder \"Happy Birthday\" on October 31, the date of\nShipp's birthday. (Id,)\n• Publicly available photos from May 25, 2018 from this account show Shipp with\nwhat appears to be an ACE bandage on his lower left arm fewer than two months\nbefore the date of the shooting. (Id, If 10.)^\n• Publicly available posts from 2018 on the account appear to show Shipp referring\nto himself as \"Pump\" and other individuals referring to him as \"Pump.\" (Id, If\n11.)\nThe Facebook Warrant required Facebook to disclose to the Government a substantial\namoxmt of information pertaining to the user ID identified:\n(a) All contact and personal identifying ioformation, including full name, user identification\nnumber, birth date, gender, contact e-mail addresses, Facebook passwords, Facebook\n^ This fact is relevant because, as noted above, the alleged shooter in the surveillance video of the incident appeared\nto be wearing bandage or similar object on his lower left arm at the time of the alleged shooting.

B-II.)\nPursuant to the Facebook Warrant, Facebook disclosed 21,471 pages. (Opp'n to\nFacebook Mot. (\"Opp'n\") (Dkt.'25) at 4.) On April 25,2019, the Government produced to\nShipp the entire retum from Facebook. (Id.) The Government states that law enforcement\nagents are continuing to review this retum to determine which parts may be seized pursuant to\nAttachment B-II. (Id.) To date, the Government has seized several pieces of evidence pursuant\nto Attachment B-II, including;\n• Evidence demonstrating that the account belongs to Shipp.\n• A status update posted by the accormt user six days before the shooting, in which\nhe referred to himself as \"Pump,\" and a message in November 2018 in which the\naccount user told another individual to call him and stated: \"my name is pump\";\n• Messages sent by the account user six days after the shooting, in which he stated\nthat he needed money and was on the run. When asked why he was on the run,\nthe account user responded, \"I know u seen the news a shooting.\" When the\nindividual said she had not seen the news and asked where the shooting has\nhappened, the account user stated, \"119 sutphin.\" When the other individualCase 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 6 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>asked if anyone was hxut, the account user wrote, \"of course they got my pics.\"\nHe later added that he had already left town.\n• Messages sent by Defendant in November 2018, in which he forwarded a post by\nthe NYPD from September 10,2018 that included a photograph of Shipp and an\nappeal for the public to help locate him \"in regards to a nonfatal shooting.\" The\nperson to whom the account user sent the post responded, \"O, my goshhh. sigh.\"\nand the account user responded, \"I know.\" Later hi the conversation, when the\nindividual told the accovmt user that this information hurts them, the accoimt user\nwrote, \"Im hurt to cuz I was chilling into this incident.\"\n(Id. at 4-6.)\nB. Procedural History\nOn January 2,2019, Shipp was arrested and charged with possession of the firearm\nalleged to have been used in the July 20,2018 incident. (See Mem. at 6; Indictment (Dkt. 7)\n^1.) He was denied bail on January 10,2019. (See Jan. 10,2019 Min. Entry (Dkt. 4); Order of\nDetention (Dkt. 5).) Shipp was arraigned on February 1,2019 before Magistrate Judge Scanlon,\nat which point he entered a plea of not guilty. (Feb. 1,2019 Min. Entry (Dkt. 11).)\nShipp now seeks to suppress evidence uncovered from the Facebook accoimt because, he\ncontends, the warrant was overbroad and not sufficiently particular. (See Mots.; Mem.) The\nGovernment opposes the motion, arguing that the Facebook Warrant met the particularity\nrequirement and was not overbroad, and that in any case, the good-faith exception would apply.\n(Id at 12-13.)Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 7 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>II. LEGAL STANDARD\nThe Fourth Amendment explicitly commands that warrants must be based on probable\ncause and must \"particularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\nseized.\" U.S. Const, amend. IV. The warrant requirement is intended to ensure that \"those\nsearches deemed necessary should be as limited as possible.\" Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403\nU.S. 443,467 (1971). \"It is familiar history that indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted\nunder the authority of 'general warrants' were the immediate evils that motivated the framing\nand adoption of the Fourth Amendment.\" United States v. Ulbricht 858 F.3d 71,99 (2d Cir.\n2017), cert, denied. 138 S. Ct. 2708 (2018) tquoting Pavton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573,583\n(1980)). \"Those general warrants 'specified only an offense,' leaving 'to the discretion of the\nexecuting officials the decision as to which persons should be arrested and which places should\nbe searched.'\" Id. (quoting Steagald v. United States. 451 U.S. 204, 220 (1981)). The principal\ndefect in such a warrant was that it permitted a \"general, exploratory rummaging in a person's\nbelongings,\" Andresen v. Maryland. 427 U.S. 463,480 (1976) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted), a problem that the Fourth Amendment attempted to resolve by requiring the\nwarrant to \"set out with particularity\" the \"scope of the authorized search,\" Kentucky v. King,\n563 U.S. 452,459(2011).\nThe appropriate scope of a search \"is defined by the object of the search and the places in\nwhich there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.\" United States v. Ross, 456 U.S.\n798, 824 (1982). Therefore, \"[j]ust as probable cause to believe that a stolen lawnmower may be\nfound in a garage will not support a warrant to search an upstairs bedroom, probable cause to\nbelieve that undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a warrantlessCase 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 8 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>search of a suitcase.\" 14, Similarly, \"[p]robable cause to believe that a container placed in the\ntrunk of a taxi contains contraband or evidence does not justify a search of the entire cab.\" Id\nTo be sufficiently particular ruider the Foruth Amendment, a warrant must satisfy three\nrequirements. Ulbricht 858 F.3d at 99. First, \"a warrant must identify the specific offense for\nwhich the police have established probable cause.\" United States v. Galpin, 720 F.3d 436,445\n(2d Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). Second, \"a warrant must describe the place to be searched.\"\nId. at 445-46 (citations omitted). Finally, the \"warrant must specify the items to be seized by\ntheir relation to designated crimes.\" Id at 446 (intemal quotation marks omitted).\nDespite their fi:equent conflation, \"[overjbreadth and particularity are related but distinct\nconcepts. A warrant may be broad, in that it authorizes the government to search an identified\nlocation or object for a wide range of potentially relevant material, without violating the\nparticularity requirement.\" Ulbricht. 858 F.3d at 102. Similarly, \"[wjhenthe criminal activity\npervades [an] entire business, seizure of all records of the business is appropriate, and broad\nlanguage used in warrants will not offend the particularity requirements.\" Id (quoting U.S.\nPostal Serv. v. C.E.C. Servs.. 869 F.2d 184,187 (2d Cir. 1989)). In determining whether a\nwarrant is overbroad, courts must focus on \"whether there exists probable cause to support the\nbreadth of the search that was authorized.\" United States v. Zemlvanskv. 945 F. Supp. 2d 438,\n464 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)\n\"Even if a warrant lacks particularity, ' [t]he fact that a Fourth Amendment violation\noccurred. .. does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary mle applies.'\" United States v. Lin,\nNo. 15-CR-601 (DLI), 2018 WL 3416524, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. July 11,2018) (quoting Herring v.\nUnited States. 555 U.S. 135, 140 (2009)). The Supreme Court has held that \"exclusion 'has\nalways been om last resort, not our first impulse,' and our precedents establish importantCase 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 9 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>principles that constrain application of the exclusionary rule.\" Herring, 555 U.S. at 140 (internal\ncitation omitted). \"Although in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an\naffidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal\ncases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\"\nUnited States v. D'Amico. 734 F. Supp. 2d 321, 359 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (quoting United States v.\nSmith. 9 F.3d 1007,1012 (2d Cir. 1993)).\nin. DISCUSSION\nA. Overbreadth and Particularity\nThe court has serious concerns regarding the breadth of Facebook warrants like the one at\nissue here.'^ The Second Circuit has observed that \"[a] general search of electronic data is an\nespecially potent threat to privacy because hard drives and e-mail accounts may be 'akin to a\nresidence in terms of the scope and quantity of private information [they] may contain.'\"\nUlbricht. 858 F.3d at 99 (quoting Galnin. 720 F.3d at 445); see also Galpin. 720 F.3d at 447\n(explaining that \"[tjhis threat demands a heightened sensitivity to the particularity requirement in\nthe context of digital searches\"). This threat is further elevated in a search of Facebook data\nbecause, perhaps more than any other location—^including a residence, a computer hard drive, or\na car—^Facebook provides a single window through which almost every detail of a person's life\nis visible.^ Indeed, Facebook is designed to replicate, record, and facilitate personal, familial.\n\" Courts have recognized a Fourth Amendment interest in the data contained in an individual's Facebook account.\nSee United States v. Mereeildo. 883 F. Supp. 2d 523, 525 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (noting that \"[w]hen a social media user\ndisseminates his postings and information to the public, they are not protected by the Fourth Amendment,\" but that\n\"postings using more secure privacy settings reflect the user's intent to preserve information as private and may be\nconstitutionally protected\" (citing Katz. 389 U.S. at 351-52 (1967)).\n' Modem cell phones may provide the closest analogy to a Facebook account because, as the Supreme Court\nexplained in Rilev v, California. 573 U.S. 373 (2014), mobile phone applications \"offer a range of tools for\nmanaging detailed information about all aspects of a person's hfe\" such that \"many of the more than 90% of\nAmerican adults who own a cell phone keep on their person a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives—\n10Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 10 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>social, professional, and financial activity and networks. Users not only voluntarily entrust,\ninformation concerning just about every aspect of their lives to the service, but Facebook also\nproactively collects and aggregates information about its users and non-users in ways that we are\nonly just beginning to understand. See, e.g.. Josh Constine, Facebook's new Studv app pavs\nadults for data after teen scandal.

Particularly troubling,\ninformation stored in non-Facebook applications may come to constitute part of a user's\n\"Facebook accoxmt\"—and thus be subject to broad searches—^by virtue of corporate decisions,\nsuch as mergers and integrations, without the act or awareness of any particular user. See Alex\nHem, EU data watchdog raises concerns over Facebook integration. The Guardian, Jan. 28,\n2019, https ://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/j an/28/eu-data-watchdog-raises-concems-\nfrom the mundane to the intimate.\" Id at 395 (explaining that \"[t]he average smart phone user has installed 33 apps,\nwhich together can form a revealing montage of the user's life).\n11Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 11 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>facebook-integration (discussing privacy concerns arising from Facebook's plans to merge three\nmessaging networks that it owns—^Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram). It is thus\nhard to imagine many searches more invasive than a search of all the data associated with a\nFacebook account. Ct Rilev. 573 U.S. at 394 (\"The sum of an individual's private life can be\nreconstructed through a thousand photographs labeled with dates, locations, and descriptions.\").\nThe Second Circuit has cautioned that \"[b]ecause of the nature of digital storage, it is not\nalways feasible to 'extract and segregate responsive data from non-responsive data.'\" Ulbricht,\n858 F.3d 99-100 (quoting Galpin. 720 F.3d at 447 (internal quotation marks omitted)). As the\nGovernment notes, courts in this circuit have applied this rationale to Facebook data in\nupholding warrants similar to the one at issue here. (Opp'n at 9-10.) See, e.g.. United States v.\nWestlev. No. 17-CR-171 (MPS), 2018 WL 3448161, at *12 (D. Conn. My 17,2018) (in\nupholding Facebook warrant, equating Facebook information to other \"electronic evidence\" and\nasserting that \"extremely broad\" disclosure is a \"practical necessity when dealing with electronic\nevidence\"); United States v. Liburd. No. 17-CR-296 (PKC), 2018 WL 2709199, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\nJune 5,2018) (upholding broad Facebook search warrant \"because of the nature of digital\nsearches\"); United States v. Tairod Nathan Webster Pugh. No. 15-CR-00116 (NGG), 2015 WL\n9450598, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 21,2015) (upholding Facebook warrant where the affidavit\nindicated that the defendant used his Facebook accoimt as a means and method of committing\nthe charged crime—attempting to join a terrorist group, and analogizing Facebook searches and\nother digital searches). However, Facebook is different from hard drives or email accounts in\nmany ways, including that the information associated with the account is categorized and sorted\nby the company—^not by the user. For this reason, Facebook is less like other areas of the\n\"digital realm, where the size or other outwardly visible characteristics of a file may disclose\n12Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 12 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>nothing about its content,\" see Galnin. 720 F.3d at 447, and more akin to a physical location, in\nwhich \"the physical dimensions of the evidence sought will naturally impose limitations on\nwhere an officer may pry: an officer could not properly look for a stolen flat-screen television by\nrummaging through the suspect's medicine cabinet, nor search for false tax documents by\nviewing the suspect's home video collection,\" id The concerns present in the search of a\nhard drive or email account—^that evidence sought could be located almost anywhere—and\nwhich necessitate broad digital search protocols do not, therefore, exist in the Facebook context.\nFor example, there is no possibility that a user could have filed an incriminating photo as a\n\"poke,\" and there is no chance that an incriminating message will be stored as a third-party\npassword or a rejected friend request. As the Eleventh Circuit has observed:\nThe means of hiding evidence on a hard drive—obscure folders,\nmisnamed files, encrypted data—are not currently possible in the\ncontext of a Facebook account. Hard drive searches require time-\nconsuming electronic forensic investigation with special\nequipment, and conducting that kind of search in the defendant's\nhome would be impractical, if not impossible. By contrast, when it\ncomes to Facebook account searches, the government need only\nsend a request with the specific data sought and Facebook will\nrespond with precisely that data. That procedure does not appear\nto be impractical for Facebook or for the government. Facebook\nproduced data in response to over 9500 search warrants in the six-\nmonth period between July and December 2015.\nUnited States v. Blake. 868 F.3d 960, 974 (11th Cir. 2017), cert, denied sub nom. Moore v.\nUnited States. 138 S. Ct. 753 (2018), and cert, denied. 138 S. Ct. 1580 (2018) (citations omitted).\nCompared to other digital searches, therefore, Facebook searches both (1) present a greater \"risk\nthat every warrant for electronic information will become, in effect, a general warrant,\" Ulbricht\n858 F.3d at 99, and (2) are more easily limited to avoid such constitutional concerns. In light of\nthese considerations, courts can and should take particular care to ensure that the scope of\nsearches involving Facebook are \"defined by the object of the search and the places in which\n13Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 13 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.\" See United States v. Ross, 456 U.S.\n798, 824 (1982); see also Blake. 868 F.3d at 974 (citations omitted) (where Facebook warrant\n\"required disclosure to the government of virtually every kind of data that could be found in a\nsocial media accoimt,\" observing that if the request before them had been more limited in time\nand limited to the crime at issue, it \"would have undermined any claim that the Facebook\nwarrants were the internet-era version of a 'general warrant'\"). In so doing, courts should be\nsensitive to the substantive differences between different tjqjes of digital data. See Rilev, 573\nU.S. at 395 (observing that \"certain types of [digital] data are also qualitatively different\").\nLike many Facebook search warrants, the warrant at issue here authorized a very broad\nsearch, but permitted the actual \"seizure\" only of certain information constituting evidence of the\ncrime of being a felon in possession after January 1,2018. (See Facebook Warrant.) The\nFacebook Warrant required the disclosure to the government of sixteen categories of information\nassociated with the Facebook accovmt, a seemingly boilerplate list apparently designed to capture\nall information associated with the account. Accordingly, Facebook provided 21,000 pages of\ninformation to the government, which included all contact and personal identifying information,\nall private messages and chat histories, all video history, all activity logs (including logs of\nactivity in associated Facebook applications), all friend requests, all rejected friend requests, all\nphotoprints, all Neoprints, and all past and present lists of friends. The Facebook Warrant even\nrequired the disclosure of information generated in connection with services that appear entirely\nunrelated to the facts in the Affidavit and the crime charged—^for example, there was no fact in\nthe Affidavit suggesting that the account holder used Facebook Marketplace, a service that can\nbe used to buy and sell items and services online, let alone that Facebook Marketplace would\n14Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 14 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>contain evidence of the charged crime of being a felon in possession or even additional evidence\nthat the account belonged to Shipp.\nMoreover, although the Facebook Warrant only permitted the government to seize\n\"evidence of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) involving ALONZO SHIPP since January 1,\n2018,\" the government was permitted to search the entire Facebook account since its creation.\n(Facebook Warrant, Attach.

Jan. 6,\n2010) (noting that a \"temporal limitation\" is an \"indic[ium] of particularity\"), it would appear to\nhave been feasible to include such a limitation here.^ Doing so could have mitigated the court's\nconcerns about the breadth of this warrant. See Blake. 868 F.3d at 974 (observing that Facebook\nwarrants \"should have requested data only from the period of time during which [the defendant]\nwas suspected of taking part in the [charged crime]\"). For example, the Affidavit did not\narticulate probable cause to believe that a search of Shipp's rejected friend requests firom years\nearlier would reveal evidence shovdng that Shipp possessed a firearm in 2018.\nFinally, the court notes that the warrant did not set any limits on what the Government\nwas required to do with the information that they collected and searched, but did not \"seize.\"\n® Given that Facebook controls the storage and cataloging of associated data, and that digital data is generally\nsortable by date stamps, temporal limitation of Facebook searches appears feasible.\n15Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 15 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>This is concerning in light of the breadth of information that Facebook was required to provide to\nthe Government pursuant to the Facebook Warrant.

But cf. Galpin, 720 F.3d at 451 (noting that the\nSecond Circuit has \"not required specific search protocols or minimization undertakings as basic\npredicates for upholding digital search warrants,\" and declining to \"impose any rigid\nrequirements in that regard at this jvmcture\").\nIn sum, the court is concemed that Facebook warrants of the kind at issue here\nunnecessarily \"authorize precisely the type of'exploratory rummaging' the Fourth Amendment\nprotects against.\" S^ United States v.

It thus provides support for Defendant's contention that the search\nauthorized by the Facebook Warrant could have been more clearly defined by its object—i^,\nevidence of possession of a firearm in 2018—^and limited to the categories of information\nassociated with the Facebook account in which there was probable cause to believe that such\nevidence might be found. (\"See Reply at 5.) ^ Galpin. 720 F.3d at 451-52 (explaining that the\n16Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 16 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>plain view exception is not available to the extent that \"digital search protocols target\ninformation outside the scope of the valid portion of the warrant,\" noting that there was little\nevidence in the record as to whether the search at issue was \"directed—^much less properly\nlimited—^to those files that would substantiate [the charged crime],\" and ordering the district\ncourt on remand to \"determine whether a search limited to evidence of a registration violation\nwould have necessitated the opening of image files or the playing of video files\").\nB. Good Faith Exception\nThat said, the court need not decide whether the Facebook Warrant violated the Fourth\nAmendment because, even if it did, the Facebook Warrant falls into the \"good faith exception\" to\nthe exclusionary rule established by United States v. Leon. 468 U.S. 897 (1984). See Blake, 868\nF.3d at 974 (declining to decide whether broad Facebook warrants violated the Fourth\nAmendment because the court formds that the good-faith exception applied). As the Second\nCircuit has noted, \"suppression is 'our last resort, not our first impulse' in dealing with violations\nof the Fourth Amendment.\" United States v. Clark, 638 F.3d 89,99 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting\nHerring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135 (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted)). The\nextent to which exclusion is justified \"varies with the culpability of the law enforcement\nconduct.\" Id (quoting Herring. 555 U.S. at 143). Thus, evidence should not be excluded where\nit was \"obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated search\nwarrant.\" Id (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 922). When an officer genuinely believes that he has\nobtained a valid warrant from a magistrate and executes that warrant in good faith, there is no\nconscious violation of the Fourth Amendment, \"and thus nothing to deter.\" United States v.\nRavmonda, 780 F.3d 105,118 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Leon. 468 U.S. at 920-21).\n17Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 17 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>\"The burden is on the government to demonstrate the objective reasonableness of the\nofficers' good faith reliance on an invalidated warrant.\" Clark. 638 F.3d at 100 (citation and\nquotation marks omitted). In assessing whether it has carried that burden, the Second Circuit has\ncautioned that \"in Leon, the Supreme Court strongly signaled that most searches conducted\npursuant to a warrant would likely fall within [the] protection [of the good-faith exception].\" Id\n\"[A]gainst this presumption of reasonableness,\" the Supreme Court has identified four\ncircumstances where an exception to the exclusionary rule would not apply:\n(1) where the issuing magistrate has been knowingly misled; (2) where the issumg\nmagistrate wholly abandoned his or her judicial role; (3) where the application is so\nlacking in iadicia of probable cause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable; and (4)\nwhere the warrant is so facially deficient that reliance upon it is unreasonable.\nId. (quoting United States v. Moore. 968 F.2d 216,222 (2d Cir. 1992)); s^ I^eon, 468 U.S. at\n923.\nNeither the &st nor the second parameter have any applicability here. With respect to\nthe other two parameters, the court finds that the Facebook Warrant was\\not \"based on an\naffidavit so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence\nentirely unreasonable,\" Leon. 468 U.S. at 923 (citation and quotation marks omitted), nor was it\n\"so facially deficient— in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be\nseized—that the executing officers c[ould not have] reasonably presume[d] it to be valid,\" id.\n(citation omitted). The Affidavit articulated probable cause to search at least certain categories\nof information or services associated with the Facebook account, and as the Government notes,\nother district courts have declined to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to facially similar\nwarrants. e^, Liburd. 2018 WL 2709199, at *3; Westlev. 2018 WL 3448161, at *12; Pugh.\n2015 WL 9450598. Therefore, although the court has serious concerns about the breadth of the\nsearch authorized here and in similar cases, it nonetheless finds that reliance on the Facebook\n18Case 1:19-cr-00029-RPK   Document 31   Filed 07/15/19   Page 18 of 19 PageID #: <pageID>Warrant by law enforcement officers was not objectively unreasonable. Application of the\nexclusionary rule in this case would thus serve little deterrent purpose.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant's (Dkt. 20) motion to suppress evidence obtained\npursuant to the Facebook Warrant is DENIED.\nSO ORDERED.\nDated: Brooklyn, New York\nJuly /]_, 2019 United States District Judge\n19\ns/Nicholas G.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The United States District Court for the District of Arizona dismissed Earl Felton Crago, Jr.'s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, adopting the Report and Recommendation from Magistrate Judge Ambri. The court conducted a de novo review of the petitioner's objections but found them meritless. The case does not involve AI, ML, or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the district court should accept the petitioner’s objections to the magistrate judge's recommendation to dismiss the habeas corpus petition.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court dismissed the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, adopting the magistrate judge's recommendation in full and finding that the petitioner's objections lacked merit.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine a teacher reviewed a student's report and gave feedback. The student disagreed with the feedback and asked the principal to take another look. The principal looked at the teacher's feedback again and decided that the teacher was right all along, so the student's report grade stayed the same. In this case, the teacher is the magistrate judge, the student is the petitioner, and the principal is the district court judge.",

The Report and Recommendation recommends dismissing \nPetitioner’s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus.  Petitioner  filed objections to the Report \nand Rec ommendation.1 \n As a threshold matter, a s to a ny new evidence, arguments, and issues that were not \ntimely and properly raised before United States Magistrate Judge Ambri , the Court \nexercises its discretion to not consider those matters and conside rs them w aived.2  See \n \n1 Unless otherwise noted by the Court, internal quotes and citations have been omitted \nwhen citing authority throughout this Order.  \n2 As a general matter, the Court notes that it has had numerous problems with parties in  \nmany cases attempting to raise new issues that could  have been raised before the  United \nStates Magistrate Judge.  The Court does not abide such actions, and allowing such actions \nundermines the Court’s ability to  properly  manage the hundreds of case s pending before \nthe Court.   See Unite d States v. Ramos , - F.4th -, 2023 WL 2850376, *16 n. 5 (9th Cir. April \n10, 2023) (“Ramos's motion for reconsideration argued that the district court failed to \nconduct de novo review because the order adopting the report and recommendation stated \nthat ‘as to any new ... arguments ... not timely ... raised before [the magistrate judge], the \nCourt exercises its discretion to not consider those matters and considers them waived” \neven though, according to Ramos, the case raised no waiver issue.

[I] n making a decision on whether \nto consider newly offered evidence, the district court must . . . exercise its discretion . . . \n[I]n providing for a de novo  determination rather than de novo  hearing, Congress intended \nto permit whatever reliance a district judge, in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, \nchose to place on a magistrate judge's proposed findings and recommendations . . . The \nmagistrate judge system was designed to alleviate the workload of district courts . . . To \nrequire a district court to consider evidence not previously presented to the magistrate judge \nwould effectively nullify the magistrate judge's consideration of the matter and would not \nhelp to relieve the workload of the district court. Systemic efficiencies would be frustrated \nand the magistrate judge's role reduced to that of a mere dress rehearser if a party were \nallowed to feint and weave at the initial hearing, and save its knockout punch for the second \nround . . . Equally important, requiring the district court to hear evide nce not previously \npresented to the magistrate judge might encourage sandbagging. [I]t would be \nfundamentally unfair to permit a litigant to set its case in motion before the magistrate, wait \nto see which way the wind was blowing, and —having received an un favorable \nrecommendation —shift gears before the district judge.”) ; United States v.

See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) (“ Within fourteen days after \nbeing served with [the Report and Recommendation] , any party may serve and file written \nobjections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. \nA judge of the court shall make a de novo  determinati on of those portions of the report or \n \nthe point. The fact that the order contained extraneous language does not negate the district \ncourt's multiple assertions that it conducted de novo review  and the magistrate judge's \nproper analysis in recommending denial of the motion to suppress. ”). \n Case 4:22-cv-00339-JAS   Document 24   Filed 01/22/24   Page 2 of 11 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of \nthe court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or \nrecommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judg e may also receive further \nevidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions. ”). \nIn addition to reviewing the Report and Recommendation and any objections and \nresponsive briefing thereto, t he Court’s  de novo  review includes review o f the record and \nauthority before United States Magistrate Judge Ambri  which led to the Report and \nRecommendation in this case ; for example, the Court’s de novo  review included the \nPetition for Writ of Habeas Corpus  (Doc. 1 – filed on 7/29/2022 ), the Respo nse (Doc. 14 \n– filed 12/6/2022), the Reply (Doc. 16 – filed 12/20/2022), and Petitioner’s Supplement  to \nReply (Doc. 17 – filed 1/10/2023).  The Court has reviewed the Report and \nRecommendation (Doc. 19 – filed 5/23/2023), Petitioner’s Objection (Doc. 20 – filed \n5/31/2023), and Respondent’s Response (Doc. 21 – filed 6/14/2023).  \n Upon de novo  review  of the record and authority herein, the Court finds Petitioner’s  \nobjections to be without merit, rejects those objections, and adopts United States \nMagistrate Jud ge Ambri’s  Report and Recommendation.  See, e.g., United States v. \nRodriguez , 888 F.2d 519, 522 (7th Cir. 1989) (“Rodriguez is entitled by statute to de novo  \nreview of the subject. Under Raddatz [447 U.S. 667 (1980)] the court may provide this on \nthe record compiled by the magistrate. Rodriguez treats adoption of the magistrate's report \nas a sign that he has not received his due. Yet we see no reason to infer abdication from \nadoption. On occasion this court affirms a judgment on the basis of the distri ct court's \nopinion. Affirming by adoption does not imply that we have neglected our duties; it means, \nrather, that after independent review we came to the same conclusions as the district judge \nfor the reasons that judge gave, rendering further explanation  otiose. When the district \njudge, after reviewing the record in the light of the objections to the report, reaches the \nmagistrate's conclusions for the magistrate's reasons, it makes sense to adopt the report, \nsparing everyone another round of paper.”) ; Bratcher v.

Princess Ermine Jewels , 786 F.2d 1447, 1450 (9th Cir. \n1986) (same).4   \n \n4 As a purely hypothetical exercise, suppose that a United States District Judge in the \nDistrict of Arizo na in the Tucson Division (or any other District Court throughout the entire \ncountry) has  approximately 300 cas es at any point in time .  Suppose that the Hypothetical \nDistrict Judge (“HDJ”) adopts a  Hypothetical United States Magistrate Judge’s  (“HMJ”)  \nReport and Recommendation (“R & R”) in 10% of the 300 constantly revolving cases each \nyear while on the bench as a HDJ from the age of 60 to 90.  Suppose that the HDJ reviewed \nall applicable published authority, and in full compliance with that published auth ority \nissued a  Hypothetical  Order  (“HO”)  (string citing and quoting 20 published cases directly \non point  - for the hypothetical, it matters not whether the  HO is 1 paragraph, 1 page, 10 \npages, or 100 pages ) adopting an R & R where the  HO indicate s that it reviewed the record \nde novo , found no merit to  a parties’  objections, and summarily adopted the HMJ's analysis \nin the R &R (and the HO does not specifically address a party's objections  as it is a non -\nexistent legal requirement according to  a plet hora of  published authority).  In light of these \nassumptions for the HDJ, the  numbers would be as follows:  (1) After 1 year, there would \nbe 30 HO’s  from this one HDJ that look largely identical as they  primarily cover  the same \nlaw and case management proce dures; ( 2) After  5 years, there would be 150 HO’s  from \nthis one HDJ that look largely identical as they primarily cover the same law and case \nmanagement procedures ; (3) After 10 years, there would be 300 HO’s from this one HDJ \nthat look largely identical a s they primarily cover the same law and case management \nprocedures ; (4) After 20 years, there would be 600 HO’s from this one HDJ that look \nlargely identical  as they primarily cover the same law and case management procedures ; \nand (5) After 30 years  on the  bench (at age 90 , achy  and ready to retire, the HDJ is \nhereinafter referred to as Super  Old Hypothetical District Judge – “SOHDJ”) , there would \nbe 900 HO’s from this one  SOHDJ  that look largely identical as they primarily cover the \nsame law and case management procedures .  While some may disapprove  of the 900 HO’s \nfrom this one SOHDJ that look largely identical as they primarily cover the same law and \ncase management procedures , the 900 HO’s from this one SOHDJ  nonetheless would fully \ncomply with published legal authority . The SOHDJ  certainly  could have:  (1) string cited \n20 different cases for the same legal standard in all 900 HO’s (i.e., 900 HO’s , times 20  new \nstring cites , equals 18,000 different cases cited for the same legal standard over the course \nof a 30 year career ); and (2) discussed the same legal standards  and case management \npractice  in 900 different ways .  The SOHDJ  ruminates that maybe if he did this, all would \ngive credence to his certification in his 900 HO’s that he conducted the required de novo \nreview as repeatedly stated in his HO’s over the last 30 years.  Perhaps, the SOHDJ  thinks, \nmaybe he should draft a wholly unique Order covering all the same issues tha t were already \ncorrectly addressed in the R & R  to further lend credence to his certification that he \nconducted a de novo  review.  However, the SOHDJ  also thinks  that maybe some will \nnonetheless think : that he simply scanned the entire case record into Chat GPT  (which \nscored in the 90th percentile on the bar exam)  and advanced  artificial intelligence wrote  the \nOrder ; or maybe he only read the objections  and R & R  (not the underlying briefing and \nhearing transcript); or maybe he was not fully concentrating while reading the underlying \nrecord as he was preoccupied with what the early bird special was at IHOP.   Perhaps, the \nSOHDJ thought, even though his de novo  review certifications (in full compliance wit h \npublished authority)  came without the proverbial  ribbons,  tags, packages , boxes  or bags, \nmaybe perhaps, his SOHDJ de novo  review certifications mean a little bit more. Alas, while \nthe beleaguered SOHDJ  could have disingenuously cited 18,000 different cas es for the Case 4:22-cv-00339-JAS   Document 24   Filed 01/22/24   Page 6 of 11 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n The Court’s case management practices are also consistent with numerous unpublished \nNinth Circuit cases.  See, e.g., United States v. Drapel , 418 F. App'x 630, 630 -31 (9th Cir. \n2011); Brook v. McCormley , 837 F.

See, e.g., Elmendorf Grafica, Inc. v. D.S. Am. (E.), Inc. , \n48 F.3d 46, 49 -50 (1st Cir. 1995); Murphy v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp. , 23 F.3d 719, 722 (2d \nCir. 1994); Brunig v.

City of Albuquerque , 232 F.3d 760, 766 (10th Cir. 2000).   \nAs to each and every individual case before the Cou rt (past, present, and future) , the \nCourt consciously conducts the de novo  review required of the Court .  Oftentimes, as the \nUnited States Magistrate Judge is a neutral arbiter of the law and facts (similar to the Court, \nand unlike parties who represent op posing factual and legal assertions), the Court (after \nconducting the required de novo  review) agrees with a Report and Recommendation’s \nanalysis as it correctly resolves the pertinent issues; in these circumstances, the Court issues \nan Order akin to this Order (i.e., an Order that  discusses the pertinent legal standards and \nstates that the Court conducted the required de novo review pursuant to those legal \nstandards).  Thus, if the applicable law has not changed and the Court’s case management \npractices ha ve not changed, the Court does not unnecessarily venture anew (in each \nindividual case  – numbering in the hundreds ) to newly string cite dozens of different cases \nthat state the same standards, nor does the Court attempt to re -word or re -phrase the many  \nquotes from those cases ( which state the controlling legal standards); nor does the Court \nattempt to re -word or re -phrase the Court’s consistent case management practice which \n \nsame controlling legal standards and stated the same legal standards and case management \npractice in 900 different ways , the SOHDJ  stood firm in his conviction this was not sound \nand effective case management practice for this particular SOHDJ .

Williams, et al. – a case involv ing 19 \ndefendants alleging a wide -ranging conspiracy involving murder, assaults, and drug \ndistribution) ( compare Doc. 2130 - 10/7/22 Order Rejecting  Report and Recommendation \n[U.S. v.

Mar. 24, 2023)]).   \nThe Court also notes that it is  in the Tucson Division of the United States District Court  \nfor the District of Arizona  (i.e., in a border town on the U.S. -Mexico border); consequently, \nthere is a very high criminal case load6 (on top of many civil cases as well).  In any given \nweek, for example, the Court may be in the midst of a criminal  (or civil)  jury trial, while \nalso preparing for the next string of scheduled jury trials coming in the subsequent weeks , \nand reviewing a voluminous record and drafting a time -sensitive civil Order in an \n \n5 In adopting a Report and Recommendation, none of the applicable authority prohibits the \nCourt from issuing Order s that incorporate: the Court’s previous, exhaustive, and correct \ndiscussion of the applicable legal standards (including numerous cases and quotes directly \nsupporting the Court’s practices), what exactly is required of the Court to comply with \nthose applicable l egal standards, and how the Court consistently proceeds to follow those \napplicable legal standards ; rather, it is consistent with the purposes of the Federal \nMagistrate Act to proceed in such a manner as it decreases the time spent on issues that \nhave previously and correctly been discussed by the Court, and  increases the time that can \nbe spent on substantive and novel issues  in the many cases before the Court – this ultimately \nimproves the effective administration of justice .  See United States v. Reyna -Tapia, 328 \nF.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003) (“Finally, it merits re -emphasis that the underlying purpose \nof the Federal Magistrates Act is to improve the effective administration of justice.”) .   \n6 Pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act which applies to criminal ca ses, these  cases typically \nmove at a rapid pace  compared to civil cases (the Speedy Trial Act is inapplicable to civil \ncases) .  See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1) ( “[T]he trial of a defendant charged in an information \nor indictment with the commission of an offens e shall commence within seventy days from \nthe filing date (and making public) of the information or indictment, or from the date the \ndefendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is \npending, whichever date last occurs. ”).   Case 4:22-cv-00339-JAS   Document 24   Filed 01/22/24   Page 8 of 11 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n emergency environmental dispute involving the Rosemont copper mine ( see Ctr. For Bio. \nDiversity v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv ., 409 F.Supp.3d 738 (D. Ariz. 2019)), and also \npreparing for and holding numerous sentencing hearings.   By proceeding in the case \nmanagement manner discussed herein, this Court is able to invest less time in assiduou sly \ndiscussing why it agrees (after the required de novo review) with the already correct \nanalysis in a Report and Recommendation, and can invest more time in presiding over jury \ntrials, preparing for upcoming trials, preparing for and presiding over sente ncing hearings, \npreparing for and presiding over oral arguments and evidentiary hearings, and preparing \nfor and drafting unique Orders (in non -referred matters) in criminal and civil cases.  \n  Simply put, the Court must divide its time between simultaneous,  competing demands; \nthe Court must exercise its case management discretion in a way that the Court deems most \neffective and appropriate in light of the many cases before the Court.  If the Court finds \n(after the required de novo  review) that a Report and R ecommendation properly resolved \nthe pertinent issues, the Court issues an Order akin to this Order; in such circumstances, \nfor example, it would be an ineffective use of this particular Court’s limited time (in each \nand every of the hundreds of individual cases before the Court) t o rehash  what the Report \nand Recommendation already properly discussed such as: what’s alleged in the Indictment \nor Complaint, the procedural history of the case, what the parties argued in a motion to \nsuppress or motion for summar y judgment (and the corresponding responses and replies), \nwho said what at an evidentiary hearing (and why certain evidence was or was not \ncredible), and an in -depth discussion of the controlling law (and the parties’ competing \ninterpretations of the law).   Furthermore, this Court exercises its discretion and does not \nconsider issues that could have and should have been raised before the United States \nMagistrate Judge; as such, any procedurally proper objections (and corresponding \nresponses thereto) are sim ply repackaging arguments (as objections) that were already \nproperly considered and rejected in the Report and Recommendation.  This Court could  \ncertainly  rehash the underlying procedural history, facts, and law  and individual ly analyze  \nevery  single  objecti on in great  detail in a unique Order leading to its de novo determination Case 4:22-cv-00339-JAS   Document 24   Filed 01/22/24   Page 9 of 11 \n- 10 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n that the  Report and Recommendation  is ultimately correct ; however, as already explained, \nthe Court considers this to be an unwise use of this Court ’s limited  time and resources.  \nRather,  this Court exercises its case management discretion to adopt Report s and \nRecommendations in Orders akin to this Order  (which h as occurred on numerous occasions \nin the past and will occur in the future)  which is  in full  compliance with authority from the \nNinth Circuit, the applicable statutory scheme, and numerous other federal circuit courts.   \nSee, e.g., United  States v.

His application was initially denied by the ALJ, but upon appeal, the district court found the denial unsupported by substantial evidence and remanded the case for an award of benefits. The case does not involve AI, ML, or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the ALJ's decision to deny disability benefits was supported by substantial evidence and free from legal error.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court vacated the ALJ's decision, finding it failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting evidence, specifically the subjective testimony of the plaintiff, third-party testimony, and the medical opinions of treating sources, leading to a remand for an award of benefits.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Timothy said he couldn’t work because health issues made it hard for him to think and remember. A judge first said, “Nope, you should be able to work.” But the higher court said the first judge didn't explain well enough why they didn't believe Timothy and others who supported him. So, they decided Timothy should get benefits to help him out.",

Tr. at 25.  Plaintiff’s \napplication was denied on July 2, 2008, a nd, after reconsideration, on November 28, \n2008.  Id.  Plaintiff was granted a hearing in wh ich he appeared, with counsel, before \nAdministrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) James E. Seiler on September 8, 2010.  Id.  The ALJ \ndetermined that Plaintiff was not disabled under the relevant provisions of the Social \nSecurity Act.  Id.  The Appeals Council denied review on Janua ry 12, 2012 ( id. at 1-6), \nand Plaintiff filed this action seeking reversal of the denial  and remand for an award of \nbenefits.  Doc. 16.  Defe ndant has filed a memorandum  in opposition (Doc. 17), and \nPlaintiff has filed a reply.  Do c. 18.  Neither party has reque sted oral argument.  For the \nreasons that follow, the Court will vacate Defendant’s decision a nd remand for an award \nof benefits. \nI. Standard of Review. \n Defendant’s decision to de ny benefits will be vacated “only if it is not supported \nby substantial evidence or is  based on legal error.”  Robbins v. Soc. Sec.

In determining whether the decision is \nsupported by substantial evid ence, the Court must consider the record as a whole, \nweighing both the evid ence that supports the decision an d the evidence th at detracts from \nit.  Reddick v. Charter , 157 F.3d 715, 720 (9th Cir. 1998 ).  If there is sufficient evidence \nto support the Commissioner’s determina tion, the Court cannot substitute its own \ndetermination.  See Young v. Sullivan , 911 F.2d 180, 184 (9th Cir. 1990). \nIII. Analysis.   For purposes of Social Security bene fits determinations, a disability is  \nthe inability to do any substantia l gainful activity by reason of \nany medically determinable phy sical or mental impairment \nwhich can be expected to result in death or which has lasted \nor can be expected to last fo r a continuous period of not less \nthan 12 months. \n20 C.F.R. § 404.1505.   \n Determining whether a claimant is di sabled involves a sequential five-step \nevaluation process.  The claimant must s how (1) he is not currently engaged in \nsubstantial gainful employment, (2) he has a severe physical or mental impairment, and \n(3) the impairment meets or equals a listed impairment or (4) his residual functional capacity (“RFC”) precludes him from performing his past work.\n1  If at any step the \nCommission determines that a claimant is or is  not disabled, the analysis ends; otherwise, \nit proceeds to the next step.  If the claimant establishes hi s burden throu gh step four, \nthe Commissioner must find the claimant disabl ed unless he finds that the claimant can \nmake an adjustment to other work.  The Co mmissioner bears the burden at step five of \nshowing that the claimant has the RFC to perform other work that exists in substantial \nnumbers in the national economy.  See 20 C.F.R. § 404.1520(a)(4)(i)-(v). \n                                              \n1 RFC is the most a claimant can do with the limitations caused by his \nimpairments.  See Rodriguez v. Bowen , 876 F.2d 759, 762 (9th  Cir. 1989); 20 C.F.R. \n§  416.945(a); SSR 96-8p, 1 996 WL 374184 (J uly 2, 1996). \n Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 2 of 13 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  The ALJ found at step one that Plaintiff had not worked  since his alleged onset of \ndisability on November 20, 2005, through the date he was last insured of December 31, \n2009.  Tr. at 27.  At step two, the ALJ found that Plain tiff suffered from the following \nsevere impairments:  viral encephalitis, fibrom yalgia, headaches, an adjustment disorder \nwith depressed mood, a nd a cognitive disorder.  Id.  The ALJ found at  step three that \nnone of these impairments or combination th ereof met or medically equaled one of the \nlisted impairments.  Id.  The ALJ found that Plaintiff ha d the RFC to perform light work \nwith moderate limitations in pe rforming sustained attention and concentration.  Tr. at 28.   \nThe ALJ found at step fo ur that Plaintiff would not be ab le to perform his past relevant \nwork in software due to his mental limitations.  Id. at 34.  The ALJ found at step five that \nPlaintiff was capable of adjusting to other wo rk that existed in si gnificant numbers in the \neconomy.  Id. at 35.  The ALJ therefore concluded that Plaintiff was not disabled.  Id.   \n Plaintiff argues that the ALJ’s determina tion was based on lega l error because he \nfailed properly to weigh Plaintiff’s subjectiv e testimony and the th ird-party testimony of \nPlaintiff’s mother and failed properly to weigh medical and opinion evidence. \n A. Plaintiffs’ Subjective Testimony. \n Plaintiff testified that he suffered a brain injury due to viral en cephalitis in 2000.  \nTr. at 47, 53.  He previously had an IQ  in the 180’s and a photographic memory.  Id. at \n46-47.  Prior to his illness, he was an entrepreneur for several start-up companies and \nworked for a software  company that developed and impl emented artificial intelligence.  \nId. at 46.  After his illness, Plaintiff could no longer do computer programing work, and \nfrom 2000 until 2005, he  worked for indeterminate periods as a retail clerk for several \nstores, including Game Crazy (part-time) and Home Depot.  Id. at 56-58.  Plaintiff \ntestified to a variety of symptoms resu lting from his brain injury, depression, and \nfibromyalgia, including that he  can no longer process math or logic; he has difficulty \ntransferring short term memory to long-term me mory; he forgets dates, such as his kids’ \nbirthdays; he drives occasiona lly but gets lost or doesn’ t know where his is; he has \nfeelings of worthlessness and suicidal thou ghts; he can’t keep a regular schedule or Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 3 of 13 \n- 4 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n remember to take his medicines; he has migr aines lasting up to a couple of days about \nthree times a month; he has “bad brain days ” when he can’t func tion enough to pull \nthoughts together; he gets ment ally exhausted, suffers fatigue, and has to take naps most \ndays and spend time alone in his room in the dark due to migraines and overstimulation if \nhe spends time with people.  Id. at 47-53.  Plaintiff lives with  his retired parents, and he \ntestified that he relies on them for help with  daily activities such as dressing, getting to \ndoctor’s appointments, and remember ing to take his medications.  Id. at 51-52.  He \ndescribed his parents as having to “rais[e] an adult child again.”  Id. at 52. \n The ALJ concluded that Plaintiff’s statements concerning the intensity, \npersistence, and limiting effects of his symptoms were “not credible to the extent they are \ninconsistent with the above residual functi onal capacity assessment.”  Tr. at 33.  In \nreaching this conclusion, the ALJ evaluate d Plaintiff’s testimony using the two-step \nanalysis established by  the Ninth Circuit.  See Smolen v. Chater , 80 F.3d 1273, 1281 (9th \nCir. 1996).  Applying the test of Cotton v. Bowen , 799 F.2d 1403 (9th  Cir. 1986), the ALJ \nfirst determined that Plaintiff’s impairme nts could reas onably produce the symptoms \nalleged.  Tr. at 33 .  Given this conclusion, and because there is no evidence of \nmalingering, the ALJ was required to present “specific, clear and convincing reasons” for \nfinding Plaintiff not entirely credible.  Smolen , 80 F.3d at 1281.2  Plaintiff argues that the \n                                              \n2 Defendant argues that the clear and convincing standa rd does not apply on the \nbasis of the Ninth Circuit’s en banc decision in Bunnell v. Sullivan , 947 F.2d 341, 345-46 \n(9th Cir. 1991), in  which the Court of Appeals stated  that to discredit a claimant’s \nsubjective complaints the ALJ must make findings “properl y supported by the record” \nthat are “sufficiently specifi c to allow a reviewing court to conclude the adjudicator \nrejected the claimant’s test imony on permissible grounds.”  Doc. 17 at 14.  Defendant \nargues that subsequent cases that have articul ated a “clear and convincing” standard are \nnot binding because only an en banc panel can overrule Bunnell .  Id. at 13.  The Court \nfinds this argument unpersuasi ve.  Subsequent cases have explained that an ALJ “may \nonly find an applicant not credible by ma king specific findings as to credibility and \nstating clear and convincing reasons for each.”  Robbins v.

Thus, \nthe cases applying the “clear and convincing” standard in no way co ntradict or overturn \nBunnell .  Furthermore, numerous cases have app lied the “clear and convincing” standard, \nand this Court is in no position to disregard them. See, e.g. , Taylor v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. \nAdmin. , 659 F.3d 1228, 1234  (9th Cir. 2011); Vasquez v. Astrue , 572 F.3d 586, 591 (9th \nCir. 2009); Lingenfelter , 504 F.3d at 1036; Orn, 495 F.3d at 635; Robbins , 466 F.3d at \n883; Smolen , 80 F.3d at 1281; Dodrill v.

Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 4 of 13 \n- 5 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n ALJ failed to meet this burden.  Do c. 13 at 18.  The Court agrees. \n General assertions that the claimant's te stimony is not credible are insufficient.  \nSee Parra v. Astrue,  481 F.3d 742, 750 (9th Cir.200 7).  The ALJ must identify “what \ntestimony is not credible and what evidence undermines the claimant’s complaints.”  Id. \n(quoting Lester,  81 F.3d at 834).  In weighing a claimant’s credibility, the ALJ may \nconsider some of the following factors: claimant’s reputation for truthfulness, \ninconsistencies either in claimant’s testimon y or between his testim ony and his conduct, \nunexplained or inadequately explained failure to seek treatment or to follow a prescribed \ncourse of treatment, claimant’s daily ac tivities, claimant’s wo rk record, and the \ncompatibility of claimant’s testim ony with the medical evidence.  Thomas , 278 F.3d at \n958-59; Lee v. Astrue , 472 Fed. Appx. 553, 555 (9th Cir. 2012)  \n Although the ALJ’s opinion contains a detailed reiteration of numerous reports \nand opinions in the reco rd, the ALJ makes no attempt to integrate his lengthy \nrecapitulation of the evidence with an analysis of what does or does not support \nPlaintiff’s testimony.3  Moreover, the ALJ’s bare asse rtion that he found Plaintiff’s \ntestimony about the severity of his symptoms  not credible because it was inconsistent \nwith the RFC not only fa ils to satisfy the requi rement that the ALJ’s reasons be “specific, \nclear, and convincing,” but it rests on faulty  reasoning.  The ALJ cannot determine the \nRFC and only then consider Plaintiff’s te stimony – the RFC must incorporate that \ntestimony.  See 20 CFR §  416.945(a)(1)&(3).  Courts have routinely rejected this kind of \ncircular approach.  See Leitheiser v. Astrue,  No. CV 10-6243-SI, 2012 WL 967647 at *9 \n(D. Or. March 16, 2012) (“Dismissing a claimant ’s credibility because it is inconsistent \n                                              \n3 Defendant points to individual pieces of evidence contained w ithin the ALJ’s six \npage summary of the record that it argues properly discount Plaintiff’s testimony \n(Doc. 17 at 15-18), but to the extent that the ALJ believed specific facts and medical \nopinions supported his negative credibility determination, he was required to say so and \nnot leave the Court to guess at his reasoning.  See Bray v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. Admin. , \n554 F.3d 1219, 1225 (9th Ci r. 2009) (“Long-standing princi ples of administrative law \nrequire us to review the ALJ’s decision based on the reasoning and factual findings \noffered by the ALJ – not post hoc  rationalizations that a ttempt to intu it what the \nadjudicator may have been thinking.”) \n Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 5 of 13 \n- 6 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n with a conclusion that must itself address th e claimant’s credibility is circular reasoning \nand is not sustained by this court.”); Vasquez v.

The Court finds that the ALJ’s rejection of \nPlaintiff’s symptom testimony without proper e xplanation or analysis was legal error.   \n B. Third-Party Testimony. \n Plaintiff’s mother, Roberta Silver, subm itted a report in which she commented on \nher son’s daily activities and functioning.  Tr. at 141-48.  Ms. Silver noted that her son \nhelps her around the house w ith walking and lifti ng heavy things, and he plays computer \ngames.  Id. at 142, 145.  Among his limitations, Ms. Silver noted that her son forgets to \nchange his clothes, bathe, shave, or comb his hair.  Id. at 142.  He needs to use lists and \ntimers to remind him to take care of personal grooming and take his medicines, but these \ndo not always work because he forg ets what the reminders are for.  Id. at 143.  Before his \ninjury, he was very active and social, but he now forgets family and friends; needs to see \npictures to remember his daughters; is afra id to go outside; and can no longer drive \nexcept in an emergency because he gets lost.  Id. at 141, 144, 146.  Ms. Silver noted that \nwhen her son has a “bad brai n day” he reverts to about  3 years old, has terrible \nheadaches, and is unable to connect ideas or complete his sentences.  Id. at 148.   \n As with Plaintiff’s testimony, the ALJ re counts Ms. Silver’s testimony in detail, \nbut merely concludes that her statements are “not  consistent with the record.”  Tr. at 34.  \nSocial Security regulations recognize that “other sources,” includi ng family, neighbors, \nand friends, may have special knowledge of an individual and can provide insight into his \nimpairments and ability to function.  20 C. F.R. § 404.1545(a)(3);  SSR 06–03p, 2006 WL \n2329939, at *2 (A ug. 9, 2006).  Consequently, “[i]f the ALJ wishes to discount the \ntestimony of [a] lay witness [ ], he must give  reasons that are german e to [that] witness.” \nDodrill v. Shalala,  12 F.3d 915, 919 (9th Cir.1993).  The ALJ’s summary statement that \nhe finds Ms. Silver’s statements “inconsistent with the record” fails to meet this standard.   \n  Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 6 of 13 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  C. Medical and Other Opinion Evidence. \n “The ALJ must consider all medical opinion evidence.”  Tommasetti v. Astrue , \n533 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir. 2008); see 20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(c); SSR 96-5p, 1996 WL \n374183, at *2 (July 2, 1996).  The ALJ may re ject the opinion of a treating or examining \nphysician by making “‘findings setting forth spec ific legitimate reasons  for doing so that \nare based on substantial evidence in the record.’”  Thomas v. Barnhart , 278 F.3d 947, 957 \n(9th Cir. 2002) (citation omitte d).  “The ALJ can ‘meet th is burden by setting out a \ndetailed and thorough summary of the facts a nd conflicting clinical evidence, stating his \ninterpretation thereof, a nd making findings.”  Id.  “The opinions of non-treating or non-\nexamining physicians may also serve as su bstantial evidence when  the opinions are \nconsistent with independent clinical findings or other ev idence in th e record.”  Id.  \nFurther, “[t]he ALJ need not accept the opin ion of any physician, including a treating \nphysician, if that opinion is  brief, conclusory, and inadequately supported by clinical \nfindings.”  Id. \n Plaintiff argues that the ALJ failed to  consider the opinions offered by various \ntreating physicians, including Drs. Dongmei Lui, M.D. and Roland V. Feltner, M.D., and \nneuropsychologists Drs. Virgin ia L. Connor, Ed.D., P.C., an d John R. Walker III, Psy.D.  \nDoc. 16 at 22-23.    Dr. Lui examined Plaintiff on April 13, 20 06.  Tr. at 221-23.  Dr. Lui noted that \nPlaintiff complained of very poor short te rm memory, difficulty fo llowing daily routines, \nand chronic headaches.  Id. at 221.  Dr. Lui found that Plaintiff had “residual cognitive \ndysfunction” and “diffuse brain damage.”  Id. at 222.  Dr. Lui examined Plaintiff again \non May 17, 2006, and noted that  he “appear[ed] to be very  frustrated and anxious[,]” \n“[wa]s stuttering with his speech[,]” and “ha[d] trouble with expressing ideas.”  Id. at \n219.  Dr. Lui recommended a neuropsycholo gical evaluation and a reassessment of \nmedications.  Id. at 219-20.  The ALJ noted that th e electroencephalogram (“EEG”) and \nMRI that Dr. Lui had ordered between these examinations came ba ck within normal \nlimits, but did not otherwise cite to  or comment on Dr. Lui’s findings.  Id. at 30.   Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 7 of 13 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  Dr. Feltner evaluated Plai ntiff on March 16, 2006.  Id. at 224-25.  He reported that \nPlaintiff “continues to have significant fati gue, trouble getting awake, trouble functioning \nduring the day as well as  he would like.”  Id. at 224.  He recommended a neurology \nconsultation and further guidan ce on appropriate medications.  Id. at 225.  The ALJ \nnoted, in an apparent referen ce to Dr. Feltner’s report, that Plaintiff had fatigue and \n“probable cognitive dysfunction and de pression” but “no seizures.”  Id. at 30.   \n Neuropsychologist Virginia L. Connor exam ined Plaintiff on October 17 and 18, \n2007, at which time she administered a numbe r of clinical tests and made a number of \nfindings, including that Plaintiff had “cognitiv e disorder” and “adjus tment disorder with \nmixed anxiety and depressed m ood – chronic.”  Tr. at 284-88 ; 287.  The ALJ, in an \napparent reiteration of D r. Connor’s five-page repor t, stated the following: \nA neurological evaluation revealed the claimant performed in the superior \nrange of intelligence.  A loss of functio n was observabl e in the frontal lobe \nexecutive function, cogn itive flexibility, problem solving and focused \nattention.  There was lowered proce ssing speed.  Current testing did not \nshow elevations on scales of depre ssion or anxiety.  There were some \ndifficulties with intermittent depressi on.  He was easily offended.  His \nperformance showed a mild impairment  in sustained focused attention, \nworking memory, divided attention and speed of processing.  Fine motor \ncoordination was impaired .  The diagnoses were a cognitive disorder, NOS \nand an adjustment disorder with depr essed mood and anxiety.  There was a \ngeneral assessment of functioning (GAF) of 65. \nTr. at 30.   \n Neuropsychologist John R. Walker examin ed Plaintiff on February 25, 2008.  \nTr. at 246-48; repeated at 264-66.  Dr. Wa lker incorporated Dr. Connor’s findings and \ndiagnoses and conducted his own supplemental tests.  Id.  Dr. Walker noted that these \ntests “suggest[ed] that Mr. Silver ma y have a tendency to become moody and \nunpredictable, particularly under stressful si tuations. . . . he may be easily offended, and \ncomplain of being misunder stood and unappreciated.”  Id. at 247.  Further, “he may show \na tendency to complain and be pessimistic as a result of frequent bodily discomfort and \nsomatic complaints.”  Id.  In addition to Dr. Connor’s diagnoses, Dr. Walker included \n“Fibromyalgia with Chro nic Pain, Migraines.”  Id.  Dr. Walker opined that Plaintiff \nwould need “to address a number of issues  prior to attempting to resume full time Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 8 of 13 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n compensated employment” and recommended that  he see a neuropsychologist “to address \ndepression, anxiety, and ad justment to disability.”  Id. at 248.  The ALJ did not separately \ncite to or address Dr. Walker’s findings.  The ALJ stated that he ac cepted the state agency ment al evaluation because it was \nsupported by the medical evidence.  Id. at 31.  This evaluation listed Plaintiff’s \nimpairments as “cognitive disorder” and “adj ustment disorder with depressed mood and \nanxiety[,]” and it rated these co nditions as “not severe.”  Id. at 301; 302; 304.  It also \nlisted Plaintiff’s restrictions of daily livin g and difficulties maintaining social functioning \nas “mild” and his difficulties in  maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace as \n“moderate.”  Tr. at 311.  Because the ALJ di d not specifically comment on or provide \nany substantive analysis of th e above-cited examining physicia ns’ opinions, it is difficult \nto tell what weight he gave to them or the ex tent to which he found them consistent with \nthe above-referenced evaluation.  The ALJ did note that Plai ntiff’s GAF score of 65 and \nIQ score or 130 were in “the  average range of ability.”  Id. at 31.\n4  These findings \ncorrelate to the findings made  by Dr. Connor and incorporated by D r. Walker.  The ALJ \nalso noted that Plaintiff had “some difficulties in focused attention[,]” “mild deficits in \ncognitive ability and simp le motor speed[,]” and “average to high average scores in \ncomprehension[,]” findings also consistent with – and apparently derived from – Dr. \nConnor’s and Dr. Walker’s reports.  Id.   \n Plaintiff argues that the ALJ discredited pe rtinent evidence, such  as that Plaintiff \nstuttered, had difficulty expressing ideas,  had difficulty concentrating and “cognitive \nslowness” (Doc. 16 at 22), but these findings are not clearly inconsistent with an RFC \nassessment of mild difficulties performing daily activities and engaging in social \ninteraction and moderate difficulties maintaini ng concentration, persis tence, or pace.  The \n                                              \n4 The GAF scale ranges from 1 to 10 0 and reflects a person’s overall \npsychological, social, and oc cupational functioning.  See Morgan , 169 F.3d at 598 n.1;  \nVargas v. Lambert , 159 F.3d 1161, 1164 n.2 (9th Cir. 1998).  A GAF score of 41 to 50 \nindicates severe symptoms or severe difficulty  in functioning and a GAF score of 51 to \n60 indicates moderate symptoms or m oderate difficulty in functioning.  See id .  \n Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 9 of 13 \n- 10 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n fact that Dr. Feltner wrote a letter to the te chnical university wher e Plaintiff enrolled to \nexplain that he would need such accommodations  as audio-visual recordings of lectures \nand extended time and quiet to take tests due to his post-encephalitis memory and \nconcentration deficits also does not, as Plaintiff argues, clearly conflict with the mild to \nmoderate limitations the ALJ found in this case.  See Doc. 16 at 22; Tr. at 291.   \n Neither does the fact that Dr. Walker opin ed that Plaintiff was not ready to pursue \nfull time employment show that the ALJ rejected Dr. Walker’s  opinion.  Dr. Walker did \nnot find Plaintiff’s assessed limitations insurm ountable.  He opined that  if Plaintiff went \nback to his treating physician to review his medications and address issues of pain, he \ncould revisit the option of returning to work, though as an employee, not as a manager of \nhis own business – a prospect with which, Dr. Wa lker noted, Plaintiff ag reed.  Tr. at 248.  \nAdditionally, the Commissioner, not  the treating physician, ma kes findings of disability.  \n20 C.F.R. § 404.1527(d)(1).  Th us, the ALJ was not required to accept the opinion of an \nexamining doctor about whethe r Plaintiff would be able to perform fu ll time work.  Id. at \n§ 404.1527(d)(3) (“We will not give any specia l significance to the s ource of an opinion \non issues reserved to the Co mmissioner”).  Finally, the ALJ found that the record was \nsufficient to show that Plaintiff suffered fro m viral encephalitis, fibromyalgia, headaches, \nan adjustment disorder with depressed mood, and a cognitive disorder – the same \nconditions Dr. Walker and the other examining phys icians diagnosed – and that these \nconditions could reasonabl y produce the symptoms Plaintiff alleged.  In sum, Plaintiff \nhas not shown that the ALJ rejected any substantive findi ngs of the examining physicians \nthat would require him to give specif ic legitimate reas ons for doing so.  \n Plaintiff argues that the ALJ imprope rly discounted the opinion of nurse \npractitioner Sally Lemberg, LCSW .  Doc. 16 at 22-23.  As noted by the ALJ, Ms. \nLemberg opined on Augu st 5, 2010 that Plaintiff had “m oderately severe limitations in \nrestriction of daily activities, responding to supervisors, work pr essures and moderate \nlimitations in perfo rming repetitive tasks.”  Tr. at 33; see id. at 587-88.  Ms. Lemberg \nalso noted Plaintiff’s pain from head aches that “take him down totally.”  Id. at 588.  She Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 10 of 13 \n- 11 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n opined that Plaintiff would not be able to work consistently because “he goes down for \nseveral days” and “he cannot tolerate others.”  Id.  The ALJ stated th at these conclusions \n“were not supported by the mental health  record” and were therefore given “little \nweight.”  Tr. at 33.  He also noted th at Ms. Lemberg was not  a psychologist or \npsychiatrist.  Id.   \n Nurse Practitioners are not an “accept able medical source” for documenting a \nmedical impairment under 20 C.F.R. § 404.1 513(a).  They are, however, considered \n“other sources” that the Commissioner may use to show the severity of a claimant’s \nimpairments and how these impairments may affect his ability to work.  20 C.F.R. \n§ 404.1513(d).  “The ALJ may discount testim ony from these ‘other sources’ if the ALJ \ngives reasons germane to eac h witness for doing so.”  Molina v. Astrue , 674 F.3d 1104, \n1111 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quot ation marks and citations omitted). \n The ALJ’s statement that Ms. Lemberg was not a psychologist or psychiatrist \nmerely affirms that her testimony is not enti tled to the weight acco rded an “acceptable \nmedical source.”  It is not itself a reas on for discrediting Ms. Lemberg’s ability to \ncomment on the severity of Pl aintiff’s impairments.  Inconsistencies with Plaintiff’s \nmental health record would be a reason fo r discounting Ms. Lemberg’s opinion, but the \nALJ provided no guidan ce beyond simply pointin g to “the mental health record” as to \nwhy he found Ms. Lemberg’s opinions unsupported.  As previously discussed, the \nopinions of Plaintiff’s examining physicians are not clearly at odds with a fi nding of mild \nto moderate mental impairments, but this do es not mean that Ms. Lemberg’s findings of \nmoderate to moderately severe impairments are wholly unsupported.  Moreover, the ALJ \ndoes not address Ms. Lemberg’s opinion re garding Plaintiff’s incapacitation from \nheadaches.  In short, the AL J failed to provide germane reasons for discounting the \nopinion of Ms. Lemberg.   \nIV. Remedy. \n The decision to remand for further develo pment of the record or for an award \nbenefits is within the discretion of the Court.   42 U.S.C. ' 405(g); see Harman v. Apfel , Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 11 of 13 \n- 12 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n 211 F.3d 1172, 1173-74 (9th Cir. 2000).  This  Circuit has held, ho wever, that an action \nshould be remanded for an award of benefits  where three conditions are met:  the ALJ has \nfailed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting evidence,  no outstanding issue \nremains that must be resolved  before a determina tion of disability can be made, and it is \nclear from the record th at the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled were \nthe rejected evidence credited as true.   \n The Court has found that the ALJ failed to  give legally-sufficient reasons for not \ncrediting Plaintiff’s subjective testimony, the third-party testimony of  Plaintiff’s mother, \nand the “other source” testimony of nurse prac titioner Sally Lemberg.  As a result, under \nNinth Circuit law, this eviden ce must be credited as true.  See Varney v. Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services , 859 F.2d 1396 (9th Cir. 1988) (“if grounds for [discrediting \na claimant’s testimony] exist, it is both re asonable and desirable to require the ALJ to \narticulate them in the original decision.”); Lester v. Chater , 81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir. \n1995) (“Where the Commissioner fails to provide adequate reasons for rejecting the \nopinion of a treating or examining physician, we credit that opinion ‘as a matter of law.’ ” \n(citing Hammock v. Bowen,  879 F.2d 498, 50 2 (9th Cir.1989); Harman v. Apfel,  211 F.3d \n1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2000) (same); Benecke v. Barnhart,  379 F.3d 587 (9th Cir.2007); ( \n“Because the ALJ failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting Benecke's \ntestimony and her treating phys icians’ opinions, we credit the evidence as true.”). \n When vocational expert Mark  Kelman was asked to cons ider Plaintiff’s testimony \nabout his headaches and his memory and concen tration deficits, he opined that Plaintiff \ncould not do his past relevant work or “any other work.”  T r. at 60, 61.  Similarly, when \npresented with a hypothetical involving an individual with the limitations noted in Ms. \nLemberg’s report, including moderate to m oderately severe limitations in ability to \nunderstand, carry out, and reme mber instructions, moderately  severe limitations in ability \nto respond appropriately to supervision, moderate limitations in  ability to respond \nappropriately to coworkers, and moderately severe limitati ons in ability to respond to \ncustomary work pressures, the vocational expert  opined that such an  individual would not Case 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 12 of 13 \n- 13 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n be able to do any work.  Id. at 62.  The vocational expert also opined that someone who \nhad to miss work three or more days a month or was unable to complete tasks in a timely \nmanner three or more days a month would not be able to sustain regular work.  Id.  Based \non these findings, it is clear that, credited as true, Plaintiff’s own testimony, the report of \nMs. Lemberg about his limitations, and the te stimony of Plaintiff’s mother regarding his \navoidance of social interaction and his pr opensity for headaches and “bad brain days” \nwould compel a finding of disability.  Becaus e there are no outstanding issues to be \nresolved, the Court will vaca te the Commission’s negative disability determination and \nremand for an award of benefits.  IT IS ORDERED: \n 1. Defendant’s decisi on denying benefits is reversed . \n 2. The case is remanded  for an award of benefits. \n Dated this 28th day of February, 2013. \n \n \nCase 2:12-cv-00540-DGC   Document 19   Filed 02/28/13   Page 13 of 13",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves a lawsuit by the estate of Gary Loyer, who died by suicide while in custody at Wayne County Jail (WCJ), alleging that the county and individual officials were deliberately indifferent to Loyer's risk of suicide, violating his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, finding no evidence that Loyer exhibited suicidal tendencies that were known to staff nor that any institutional policies directly caused his death.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Wayne County and its officials were deliberately indifferent to the risk of inmate Gary Loyer's suicide, thereby violating his constitutional rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, concluding that there was no evidence that jail staff were aware of a strong likelihood that Loyer would commit suicide, nor was there evidence that any policies or practices of Wayne County caused his death.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're responsible for keeping an eye on people in a big building to make sure they're safe. If one of them hurts themselves and their family says it's because you didn't do your job right, a judge would look at whether you ignored obvious signs of trouble. In this case, the judge found that no one saw clear signs that the person was in danger, so it wasn't anybody's fault from a legal standpoint.",

Introduction \nPlaintiff Gary Loyer, Sr., as Personal Representative for the Estate of \nGary Loyer  (“plaintiff estate” or “plaintiff”), sued defendants Wayne Count y \n(“County”) and several individual county officials1 in their official capacity \n \n1 As set forth in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), plaintiff estate sues \nDaniel Pfannes, Undersheriff for the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office, Robert Dunlap, Chief of Jails and Court Operations, James E. David, Deputy Chief of Jail Operations, and Raphael  Washington, Wayne County Sheriff. See \nECF No. 5.  Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 1 of 22Page 2 of 22 \n under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of plaintiff decedent’s Eighth and \nFourteenth Amendment rights in connection with his death by suicide while \nin custody at the Wayne County Jail (“WCJ”). ECF No. 5. Defendants filed \na motion for summary judgment on all claims. ECF No. 47. The motion was \nfully briefed, and the Court heard oral argument on March 12, 2025. ECF \nNos. 50, 51, 52. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the \nmotion.  \nII. Factual Background  \nGary Loyer  was booked into WCJ on charges of armed robbery on \nthe evening of January 31, 2020. ECF No. 47 -2. The following day he was \nscreened by an employee of Wellpath, the medical service provider for WCJ. ECF No. 47 -3. During that screening, Loyer indicated that he did not \nhave a current or past mental health diagnosis, had not been prescribed medication for emotion al or mental health problems, was not a current or \npast co nsumer of mental health treatment, did not ha ve concerns about his \nability to cope  emotionally or manage stress, did not have feelings of \nhopelessness/helplessness, had not had thoughts of killing himself, and he Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 2 of 22Page 3 of 22 \n had not attempted suicide in the past.2 Id.; ECF No. 50 -1, PageI D.644-649. \nLoyer’s only risk factor identified on his mental health screen, his current \ncharge of armed robbery, prompted only a routine, not an urgent or STAT \nreferral to  Wellpath’s mental health service and did not warrant placement \non suicide watch. ECF No. 47 -3, PageID.503; ECF No. 50 -1, PageID. 649. \nLoyer’s screening indicates that he was recommended for placement in \ngeneral population housing. ECF No. 47 -3, PageID.505; ECF No. 50- 1, \nPageID.651.  \n \n2 Plaintiff states in its response brief  that “[d]uring Loyer’s February 1, 2020 \nmedical screening, he reported a history of psychiatric illness, daily \nmethamphetamine abuse, and severe withdrawal symptoms, including hallucinations. (Ex. 7 Loyer Medical Records). Staff noted he was ‘uncooperative, ’ ‘very anxious, ’ and ‘angry. ’ Id.” But, as set forth here, the \nrecords cited reveal the opposite: A history of psychiatric illness was specifically denied, as was current or prior withdrawal. ECF No. 50-1, PageID.647 -48. For behavior, the box for “uncooperative” was not checked ; \nthe box checked noted Loyer’s behavior as  “appropriate.” “Anxious” and \n“Angry” were options to describe mood, but neither were checked for Loyer. Id. at PageID.644. In stead , “Unremarkable” was selected. Id. At the hearing \non this matter, the Court admonished plaintiff’s counsel  for including \nArtificial Intelligence(AI)-generated bogus legal citations in plaintiff’s \nresponse brief  and ordered him to attend an ethics seminar . See ECF No. \n68. This brazen factual fabrication, perhaps also the result of counsel’s inappropriate dependence on AI, cannot be tolerated; the Court  strongly \nurges counsel to exercise greater vigilance in preparing court -filings that \nare factually and legally accurate. Further transgressions of this sort will \nresult in disciplinary action.   Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 3 of 22Page 4 of 22 \n Loyer was housed in Division 2 of WCJ, know n as “the old jail,” and \nassigned a bunk in Ward 208, Cell 6. ECF No. 47 -2. On February 8, 2020, \nLoyer did not appear depressed or suicidal to other inmates and at least \none observing corrections officer  (“CO”). ECF No. 47 -10, PageID.525, 530, \n535; ECF No. 50 -1, PageID.660; ECF No. 69, PageID.1286. In response to \nthe Detroit Police Department (“DPD”) investigation  of Loyer’s suicide , one \ninmate speculated that Loyer may have been depressed but never said anything:  “He was very fidgety and he kept talking about how he was going \nto beat his case.” ECF No. 47 -10, PageID.525. Another inmate noted that \nhe had played cards with Loyer a couple times , and Loyer did not seem \nsuicidal or depressed. Id. at PageID.530.  Another reported, “he sounded \nnormal, like the day before.” Id. at 533. The DPD report reflects two other \ninmates who stated that Loyer “didn’t seem to have anything wrong with him” and that “Loyer’s death came as a surprise because it didn’t seem like anything w as bothering him.” ECF No. 50 -1, PageID.660.  \nAccording to WCJ records, C O Marcus Washington completed his \nrounds  of Wards 208 -209 at 11:09  p.m. Id. at 689. CO James Oliver o \nbegan his rounds at approximately 11:37  p.m. Id. At approximately 11 :40 \np.m. Olivero approached Loyer’s cell and noticed a sheet had been placed Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 4 of 22Page 5 of 22 \n in the cell, partially obstructing the view inside, and called out to Loyer to \nremove it. Id. at PageID.670. When he received no response, he observed \nthat Loyer was sitting on the floor against the bars with a knot in the sheet \nabove him. Id . Olivero called for Washington and CO Joshua Nutter to pull \nthe duress alarm, which did not sound, and to call a Code 2.  Id. Nutter \nrespon ded to the scene and assisted with cutting the sheet from Loyer’s \nneck.  Id. The COs performed CPR until Wellpath nurses, and eventu ally \nDetroit EMS , arrived to take over lifesaving measures. Loyer was \npronounced dead at 12 :27 a.m. on February 9, 2020. Id . \nThe investigation revealed  that Loyer  left a suicide note, which was \nfound in his cell, and the Wayne County Medical Examiner classified his death as a suicide. ECF No. 47 -5; ECF No. 47 -6. \nPlaintiff estate claims defendants violated Loyer’s Fourteenth \nAmendment rights by failing to thwart his suicide. ECF No. 5 (Count III). Plaintiff also asserts several state law claims against defendants, including \nwrongful death, gross negligence, and intentional in fliction of emotional \ndistress. Id. (Counts I, II, IV, V). Plaintiff assert s that the County and the \nindividual ly named county officials were deliberately indifferent to Loyer’s \nknown risk of suicide. Specifically, plaintiff argues that the Coun ty’s failure Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 5 of 22Page 6 of 22 \n to repai r video cameras in WCJ areas housing suicidal inmates  amounted \nto deliberate indifference. See  ECF No. 50. Plaintiff also contends  that the \nCOs on duty the night of Loyer’s suicide failed to conduct the WCJ -\nmandated 30- minute checks. Id . at PageID.556. Defendants contend that \nthey are entitled to summary judgment because there is no evidence that \nLoyer demonstrated a risk of suicide while in WCJ custody, nor is there \nevidence  that the County had a custom, policy, or practice  of indifference to \nknown risks of suicide . ECF No. 47, PageID.480. Furthermore, the \nindividual defendants contend that plaintiff sued them in their official \ncapacities only (as spelled out in the FAC), and thus only asserted clams \nagainst the municipality . ECF No. 47.  \nIII. Analysis  \nA. Standard of Review  \nSummary judgment is appropriate where the evidence in the record, \nviewed in its entirety, shows that there is no genuine issue as to any \nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter \nof law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When a party files a motion for summary \njudgment, it must be granted “if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 6 of 22Page 7 of 22 \n matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). “A party asserting that a fact cannot \nbe or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by: (A) citing to \nparticular parts of materials in the record . . .; or (B) showing that the \nmaterials cited do not establi sh the absence or presence of a genuine \ndispute, or that an adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to \nsupport the fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). The standard for determining \nwhether summary judgment is appropriate is whether the evidence presen ts a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or \nwhether it is so one -sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law. \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 251-52 (1986). Additionally, \nthe evidence and all reasonable inferences must be construed in the light most favorable to the non- moving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v. \nZenith Radio Corp. , 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  \nWhere the movant establishes the lack of a genuine issue of material \nfact, the burden of demonstrating the existence of such an issue shift s to \nthe non -moving party, who must come forward with “specific facts showing \nthat there is a genuine issue for trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. \n317, 322 -23 (1986). That is, the party opposing a motion for summary \njudgment must make an affirmative showing with proper evidence and must Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 7 of 22Page 8 of 22 \n designate specific facts in affidavits, depositions, or other factual material \nshowing “evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non -\nmovant].” Anderson , 477 U.S. at 252. However, mere allegations or denials \nin the non -movant’s pleadings will not satisfy this burden, nor will a mere \nscintilla of evidence supporting the non -moving party. Id. at 248, 251.  \nIf the nonmoving party fails to make a sufficient showing on an \nessential element of its case with respect to which it has the burden of \nproof, the movant is entitled to summary judgment. Celotex , 477 U.S. at \n323. The court must construe Rule 56 with due regard not only for the \nrights of those “asserting claims and defenses that are adequately based in \nfact to have those claims and defenses tried to a jury,” but also for the rights of those “oppos ing such claims and defenses to demonstrate in the \nmanner pro vided by the Rule, prior to trial, that the claims and defenses \nhave no factual basis.” Id. at 327.   \nB. Deliberate Indifference  \nPlaintiff asserts that the County and the individual defendants were \ndeliberately indifferent to Loyer’s known risk of suicide. ECF No. 50. As defendants point out, plaintiff estate sued the individual defendants in their \nofficial capacities only. See ECF No. 5. Official capacity claims are different Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 8 of 22Page 9 of 22 \n from claims against defendants in their individual capacity. See Essex v. \nLivingston Cnty. , 518 F. App’x 351, 354 (6th Cir. 2013) (citing Kentucky v. \nGraham , 473 U.S. 159, 165 -67 (1985)). Government officials face personal \nliability when sued in their individual capacity whereas officials sued in their official capacity expose only the government entity to liability. Id. “In other \nwords, an official -capacity claim is merely another name for a claim against \nthe municipality.” Id. (citing Cady v. Arenac Cnty. , 574 F.3d 334, 342 (6th \nCir. 2009)).  \nA municipal entity cannot be liable under § 1983 if there is no \nunderlying constitutional violation. City of Los Angeles v. Heller , 475 U.S. \n796, 799 (1986) ; A court’s finding that an individual defendant is not liable \nfor a constitutional violation , however, does not necessarily foreclose \nmunicipal liability. North v. Cuyahoga Cnty. , 754 F. App ’x 380, 389 (6th Cir. \n2018) . Under certain  “circumstances a municipality can be liable when the \nplaintiff suffered a constitutional violation but cannot attribute it  to any \nindividual defendant’s unconstitutional conduct .” See id. (collecting cases). \nA municipality may be liable based on the actions of individual government \nactors other than those who are named as parties. Winkler v. Madison Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 9 of 22Page 10 of 22 \n Cnty. , 893 F.3d 877,  900 (6th Cir. 2018) (quoting Epps  v. Lauderdale , 45 F. \nApp'x 332, 334–35 (6th Cir. 2002) (Cole, J., concurring)).    \nHere, plaintiff has not alleged, nor provided evidence that any named \ndefendant or WCJ officers  violated Loyer’s constitutional rights . None of the \nnamed defendants had any interaction or involvement with Loyer during his \ntime in WCJ.  See ECF No. 5 ; see Doe v. Jackson Loc. Sch. Dist. Bd. of \nEd., 954 F.3d 925, 934 (6th Cir. 2020) (under § 1983, defendants may only \nbe liable for their own conduct, not for the conduct of others under a \nvicarious -liability theory).  Nor has plaintiff offered evidence to support that \nany of the unnamed off icers who did interact with Loyer were deliberately \nindifferent to a substantial risk of harm he faced . See Lawler v. Hardeman \nCnty. , 93 F.4th 919, 926 (6th Cir. 2024)  (internal quotation omitted) . \nJail staff may violate the Due Process Clause by failing to protect \npretrial detainees from harm, including failing to thwart a detainee’s suicide. Id. at 926 (citing Downard v. Martin , 968 F.3d 594, 598 -99 (6th Cir. 2020)). \nFailure -to-protect claims carry both objective and subjective elements: \n“Objectively, [pretrial detainees] must have faced a ‘substantial risk of serious harm’” and “[s]ubjectively, officers must have acted with ‘deliberate \nindifference’ to this risk.” Id. (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834 Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 10 of 22Page 11 of 22 \n (1994)). Prior to 2023, a pretrial detainee had to prove that an officer both \nsubjectively knew of the facts that created a substantial risk of serious harm \nto the detainee and that the officer subjectively concluded that the risk \nexisted. Id. at 926 -27. \nMost cases addressing inmate suicides hinge on t he subjective \nelement . Id. at 929.  This element requires a detainee “to prove that an \nofficer knew of the facts creating the substantial risk of serious harm[,]…that the officer believed that this substantial risk existed, [a]nd… that the officer ‘responded ’ to the risk in an unreasonable way.” Id . (quoting \nFarmer , 511 U.S. at 844 and citing Beck v. Hamblen Cnty. 969 F.3d 592 , \n601–02 (6th Cir. 2020)). Because detainees “often take their lives ‘without \nwarning ,’ [such that] jail staff will find it ‘difficult’ to identify the inmates who \npose substantial suicide risks[,]…an estate must prove more than that an officer knew of a ‘possibility’ or ‘even a likelihood’ of the suicide.” Id. \n(quoting Andrews v. Wayne Cnty , 957 F.3d 714, 717 (6th Cir. 2020) and \nDownard , 968 F.3d at 601). “Rather, the officer must have believed that a \n‘strong likelihood’ existed that the inmate would commit suicide.” Id. \n(quoting Barber v. City of Salem , 953 F.2d 232, 240 (6th Cir. 1992) ). Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 11 of 22Page 12 of 22 \n Rarely will correction officers admit they knew of a strong likelihood \nthat an inmate would try to kill themselves , so estates must often rely upon \ncircumstantial evidence to establish the officer ’s knowledge . Id. “[C]aselaw \nsets a ‘high bar ’ for plaintiffs who try to prove an officer ’s knowledge in this \ncircumstantial way.” Id. (citing Downard , 968 F.3d at 601). Required \nevidence include s that an officer knew of an inmate ’s “suicide watch” \nclassification. Id.  \nThe Sixth Circuit found that this high evidentiary bar was “met when \nan inmate told officers that he was suicidal and needed to go to the hospital \nand when the officers knew that he had recently been released from a \nmental -health facility.” Id. at 929 -30 (citing Bonner -Turner v. City of Ecorse, \n627 F. App'x 400, 408–10 (6th Cir. 2015)). The Sixth Circuit  likewise  “found \nthe bar met when an officer knew of the inmate ’s past suicide attempts, \nknew that the inmate had recently been placed on suicide watch, and  knew \nthat the inmate was complaining of pain and crying out to go to the \nhospital.” Id. at 930 (citing Schultz v. Sillman , 148 F. App'x 396, 401 –03 \n(6th Cir. 2005)). To the contrary, the court “granted summary judgment to \nan officer even though she knew that the deceased inmate seemed \ndespondent.” Id. (citing Downard , 968 F.3d at 601 –02). It also “granted Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 12 of 22Page 13 of 22 \n summary judgment to medical staff even though they knew that the \ndeceased inmate had been suffering from drug withdrawals and refusing \nmedication and meals.” Id. (citing Broughton v. Premier Health Care Servs. , \n656 F. App'x 54, 57 –58 (6th Cir 2016)). And finally, the court “granted \nsummary judgment to a jail doctor who knew of an inmate ’s prior attempt to \nharm himself and recent suicidal thoughts because the inmate had said \nthat he no longer felt suicidal.” Id. (citing Nallani v. Wayne Cnty ., 665 F. \nApp'x 4 98, 507 –08 (6th Cir. 2016)).  \nGuided by this precedent, plaintiff estate here clearly lacks evidence \nfrom which a reasonable jury could find the  COs responsible for Loyer  \nbelieved there was a strong likelihood that he would commit suicide. Loyer \ndenied any past suicide attempts and any current suicidal thoughts during \nhis intake screening eight days before his suicide. ECF No. 50 -1, \nPageID.649. He also denied ever or currently suffering from withdrawal  and \ndenied a current or past psychiatric diagnosis. Id . at 647 -48. Nor does \nplaintiff  estate supply evidence that Loyer said or did anything to suggest \nthat he would take his own life. The guards and other inmates on his ward \nindicated that he played cards with other detainees earlier the day he \ncommitted suicide. ECF No. 47 -10, PageID. 530; ECF No. 69, Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 13 of 22Page 14 of 22 \n PageID.1286.  One inmate described Loyer as fidgety and maybe \ndepressed,  ECF No. 47 -10, PageID.525, but even if the officers interacting \nwith Loyer knew of th ose observations , they fall far short of those required \nto meet the high bar for proving a strong likelihood for committing suicide. \nSee Lawler , 93 F.4th at 931 (caselaw forecloses any reliance on generic \nrisk factors such as substance abuse problems or even historical suicide \nattempts) ; see also Downard , 968 F.3d at 601 –02) (knowledge that inmate \nwas despondent was not knowledge of strong likelihood of suicide); Broughton , 656 F. App'x at 57–58  (medical staff’s knowledge that  \ndeceased inmate had been suffering from drug withdra wals and refusing \nmedication and meals  did not equate to knowledge of strong likelihood of \nsuicide) . Without evidence that any officer knew of a strong likelihood that \nLoyer would commit suicide, plaintiff c ould not satisfy the subjective \nelement for a deliberate indifference claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Accordingly, a municipal liability claim \nagainst the County  cannot arise from an individual CO’s violation of Loyer’s \nconstitutional rights . \nA finding that no individual defendant violated the plaintiff ’s \nconstitutional rights often  mean s that the plaintiff has suffered no Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 14 of 22Page 15 of 22 \n constitutional violation . North , 754 F. App’x at 390. And a constitutional \nviolation is required for  municipal liability to lie. Est. of Andrews v. City of \nCleveland , 112 F.4th 436, 450 (6th Cir. 2024) ; see also Epps , 45 F. App’x \nat 334 (Cole, J., concurring) ( Heller prohibits municipal liability when the \nvictim suffers no constitutional injury at all ). Nevertheless, “it is proper to \nconsider possible constitutional violations committed by a municipality qua \nmunicipality, even in the absence of a showing of a constitutional violation by any one individual officer .” Grote v. Kenton Cnty. , 85 F.4th 397, 414 (6th \nCir. 2023) .  \nPlaintiff ’s efforts to demonstrate that the County itself violated Loyer’s \nconstitutional rights  also fail . To establish municipal liability, “a plaintiff must \nprove: (1) the existence of an illegal official policy or legislative enactment; \n(2) that an official with final decision -making authority ratified illegal actions; \n(3) the existence of a policy of inadeq uate training or supervision; or (4) the \nexistence of a custom of tolerance of or acquiescence to federal rights \nviolations.” Stewart v. City of Memphis , 788 F. App’x 341, 344 (6th Cir. \n2019) (internal quotation and marks omitted). “[T] o hold a municipality liable \nunder § 1983, a plaintiff must prove that the municipality’s policy or custom caused  the alleged injury.” Ouza v. City of Dearborn Heights , 969 F.3d 265, Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 15 of 22Page 16 of 22 \n 286 (6th Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)  \n(emphasis added) . A plaintiff “must identify the policy, connect the policy to \nthe [county]  itself and show that the particular injury was incurred because \nof the execution of that policy.” Andrews , 957 F.3d at 721 -22. \nPlaintiff , emphasizing media reports of WCJ’s historical ly high rate of \nsuicides, argues that WCJ’s “long -standing failure to repair known camera \nblind spots in areas housing suicidal inmates…typifies the kind of custom of \ntolerance or acquiescence giving rise to Monell  liability.” ECF No. 50, \nPageID.563. To succeed on a custom of tolerance or acquiescence claim \nfor municipal liability, a plaintiff must prove  the following : (1) the existence \nof a clear and persistent pattern of illegal activity; (2) notice or constructive \nnotice on the part of the municipality; (3) the municipality's tacit approval of \nthe unconstitutional conduct, such that their deliberate indifference in their \nfailure to act can be said to amount to an official policy of inaction; and (4) that the municipality's custom was the moving force or direct causal link in \nthe constitutional deprivation. Stewart , 788 F. App’x at 347-48 (quoting \nThomas v. City of Chattanooga , 398 F.3d 426, 429 (6th Cir. 2005)) \n(quotation marks omitted).  Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 16 of 22Page 17 of 22 \n Assuming for the sake of argument that plaintiff could satisfy the first \nthree prongs of this requirement —that the County’s refusal to repair \ncameras in the WCJ areas housing suicidal inmates equated to an official \npolicy of inaction, it cannot satisfy the  fourth prong. In other words, plaintiff \ncannot establish that the absence of cameras in areas housing suicidal \ninmates was the direct causal link to the County’s failure to thwart Loyer’s \nsuicide. Plaintiff has not offered plausible evidence that Loyer wa s housed \nin an area designated for suicidal detainees.3 To the contrary, the record \nevidence supports defendants’ assertion that Loyer was housed in a \ngeneral population ward. See ECF No. 50 -1, PageID.651, 755; ECF No. \n69, PageID.1282 . Nor, as discussed above, can plaintiff point to any \nevidence to support that Loyer identified or demonstrated any suicidal \n \n3 As pointed out at the hearing on this motion, plaintiff relies solely on a \nscreenshot of a list of detainees in Ward 208 , which contains  this notation \nat the bottom: “ SUICIDE  WARD  208  TIME: 0004 HOURS  CASE # 1988 -\n20 OIC OFFICER JAMES OLIVERO” to support its claim that Loyer was \nhoused on a suicide ward. ECF No. 50-1, PageID.657. At the h earing, \ncounsel for defendants indicated that the word “Suicide” in that footer  refers \nto the event, followed by the location where the event occurred, “Ward 208.” In other words, “ suicide” does not modify “Ward 208.”  Even if the \nCourt accepted plaintiff’s interpretation that this footer refers to Ward 208 as Suicide Ward 208, this footer is not “evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252. “A mere \nscintilla of evidence supporting the non -moving party” does not create  a \ngenuine issue of material fact.

See ECF No. 47 -10, PageID.525, 530, \n535; ECF No. 50 -1, PageID.644, 647 -48, 660. Finally, plaintiff does not \nallege or argue that camera disrepair in the general population areas of the jail amounts to deliberate indifference to a known risk of suicide. \nAccord ingly, notwithstanding known and longstanding nonfunctioning \ncameras within WCJ, plaintiff cannot establish municipal liability against the \nCount y under a custom or tolerance or acquiescence theory  because \nLoyer’s suicide would not have been prevented by the presence of working \ncameras in the areas housing suicidal inmates.  \nPlaintiff’s brief in response to defendants’ motion hints at the \nassertion of a failure to train argument. ECF No. 50, PageID.564. “I ssues \nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at \ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived —it is not sufficient for a \nparty to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the \ncourt to put flesh on its bones.” Alston v. City of Detroit Police Officers, 717 \nF. Supp. 3d 618, 628 –29 (E.D. Mich. 2024)  (quoting McPherson v. Kelsey , \n125 F.3d 989, 995 -96 (6th Cir. 1997) ) (cleaned up ). Even  if the Court does \nnot deem the superficial nature of that allusion as a waiver of such an  Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 18 of 22Page 19 of 22 \n argument, plaintiff cannot demonstrate deliberate indifference based on \ninadequate training .  \n“To succeed on a failure to train or supervise claim, the plaintiff must \nprove the following: (1) the training or supervision was inadequate for the tasks performed; (2) the inadequacy was the result of the municipality ’s \ndeliberate indifference; and (3) the inadequacy was closely related to or \nactually caused the injury.” Ouza, 969 F.3d at 286-87. A plaintiff may \nestablish that inadequate training results from municipal “deliberate indifference by showing that the municipality has failed to act in response  to \nrepeated complaints of constitutional violations by its officers .” Id. at 287 \n(internal quotations omitted).  Alternatively, “a plaintiff can show that a \nmunicipality was deliberately indifferent by failing to equip law enforcement \nofficers with specific tools to handle recurring situations.” Id. (quoting Bd. of \nComm’rs v. Brown , 520 U.S. 397, 409 (1997)) (cleaned up).  \nPlaintiff has not offered evidence that the County failed to act in \nresponse to repeated complaints of constitutional violations by its officers. \nSee id. Moreover , even if plaintiff had evidence (which it does not)\n4 that the \n \n4 Plaintiff’s response brief , citing generally to defendants’ discovery \nresponses,  states that defendants could identify only two officers who had \nreceived suicide prevention training in the three years before Loyer’s death . Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 19 of 22Page 20 of 22 \n County failed to provide its officers with any suicide prevention training and \nthat the need to train officers to recognize and respond to inmates \ndemonstrating suicidal tendencies was so obvious that the failure to do so \ncould be characterized as deliberate indifference to constitutional rights, it \nwould still have to  prove that the failure to train caused the defendants’ \nfailure to prevent Loyer’s suicide.  See Jackson v. City of Cleveland , 925 \nF.3d 793,  837 n.26 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting Ciminillo v. Strei cher, 434 F.3d \n461, 469 (6th Cir. 2006) (cleaned up) (“A failure -to-train claim…requires \nshowing that the failure to train “was closely related to or actually caused \nplaintiff’s injury.”).  Once again, the absence of evidence that Loyer voiced \nor exhibited any suicidal propensities to anyone prior to taking his life would \nbe fatal to such an argument. Officers trained in recognizing and \nresponding to signs of suicidal intent can only do so if such signs are \ndisplayed. Here , as discussed,  plaintiff  has not identified any remark or \nconduct from Loyer that would have alerted a properly trained officer to the \nrisk of his suicide. In other words, plaintiff lacks evidence that further \ntraining would have prevented Loyer’s suicide.  \n \nECF No. 50, PageID.557. In its  review of the discovery responses attached \nto plaintiff’s response brief , the Court found no  information related to \nsuicide prevention training. See ECF No. 50 -1, PageID.713 -32.  Case 4:21-cv-12589-SDK-CI   ECF No. 71, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/21/25   Page 20 of 22Page 21 of 22 \n In sum, notwithstanding the much -publicized spate of suicides at \nWCJ several years ago, plaintiff has not supplied evidence that working \ncameras in the areas housing suicidal inmates, or  correction officers more \nfully trained for suicide prevention could have thwarted Loyer’s suicide. \nAccordingly, plaintiff cannot prove , as it must,  that any municipal policy was \nthe moving force in  defendants’ failure to prevent Loyer’s suicide. The \nCounty is thus entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff’s municipal liabil ity \nclaim.  \nC. State Law Claims  \nDefendants argue that they are entitled to absolute governmental \nimmunity from all potential state law tort liability to plaintiffs. Because \nplaintiff does not address this argument or its state law claims in its \nresponse to defendants’ motion for summary judgment, these claims are \ndeemed abandoned. See Briggs v. University of Detroit -Mercy , 611 F. \nApp’x 865, 870 (6th Cir. 2015).  \nIV. Conclusion \nFor these reasons, the Court GRANTS  defendants’ motion for \nsummary judgment (ECF No. 47)  and DISMISSES WITH PREJUDICE  \nplaintiff’s FAC (ECF No. 5).  This matter is now closed.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of *Angelica M. Loreto v. Arizona Board of Regents*, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona reviewed a Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation on a Motion to Dismiss filed by the defendant. While the Magistrate Judge recommended partially granting and partially denying the motion, the defendant objected, seeking total dismissal. The Court conducted a de novo review, ultimately agreeing with the Magistrate's recommendations and thus, declined the defendant’s objections, adopting the recommended dismissals and denials in part and whole respectively. There is no mention of AI, ML, or automated systems being involved in this case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendant's Motion to Dismiss should be entirely granted in the face of objections to the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Court denied the defendant's objections, adopted the Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendation in its entirety, and decided to partially grant and partially deny the Motion to Dismiss.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Angelica Loreto had a case against the Arizona Board of Regents. The judge's assistant (Magistrate Judge) suggested letting some parts of Loreto’s case go forward but dismissing others. However, the Arizona Board didn't like this suggestion and wanted the whole case thrown out. The main judge reviewed everything from scratch, agreed with the assistant, and decided to follow their suggestion, not dismissing the entire case.",

No. CV-22-00269-TUC -JAS (AMM ) \n \nORDER  \n \n  \nDISCUSSION   \nPending before the Court is a Report and Recommendation issued by United States \nMagistrate Judge Martinez .  The Report and Recommendation recommends granting \nDefendant ’s Motion to Dismiss in part  and denying it in part .  Defendant  filed objections \nto the Report and Recommendation , arguing th e Court should have granted th e motion in \nits entirety . Plaintiff filed no objection .1  \n As a threshold matter, a s to a ny new evidence, arguments, and issues that were not \ntimely and properly raised before United States Magistrate Martine z, the Court exercises \nits discretion to  not consider those matters and conside rs them waived.2  See United States \n \n1 Unless otherwise noted by the Court, internal quotes and citations have been omitted \nwhen citing authority throughout this Order.  \n2 As a general matter, the Court notes that it has had numerous problems with parties in  \nmany cases attempting to raise new issues that could  have been raised before the  United \nStates Magistrate Judge.  The Court does not abide such actions, and allowing such actions \nundermines the Court’s ability to  properly  manage the hundreds of case s pending  before \nthe Court.   See United States v. Ramos , - F.4th -, 2023 WL 2850376, *16 n. 5 (9th Cir. April \n10, 2023) (“Ramos's motion for reconsideration argued that the district court failed to \nconduct de novo review because the order adopting the report and re commendation stated \nthat ‘as to any new ... arguments ... not timely ... raised before [the magistrate judge], the Case 4:22-cv-00269-JAS-MSA   Document 34   Filed 09/28/23   Page 1 of 11 \n- 2 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n v. Howell , 231 F.3d 615, 621 -623 (9th Cir. 2000) (“[A] district court has discretion, but is \nnot required, to consider evidence presented for the first time in a party's objection to a \nmagistrate judge's recommendation . . . [I]n making a decision on whether to consider \nnewly offered evidence, the district court must . . . exercise its discretion . . . [I]n providing \nfor a de novo  determination rather than de novo  hearing, Congress intended to permit \nwhatever reliance a district judge, in the exercise of sound judicial discretion, chose to \nplace on a magistrate judge's proposed findings and recommendations . . . The magistrate \njudge system was designed to alleviate the workload of di strict courts . . . To require a \ndistrict court to consider evidence not previously presented to the magistrate judge would \neffectively nullify the magistrate judge's consideration of the matter and would not help to \nrelieve the workload of the district co urt. Systemic efficiencies would be frustrated and the \nmagistrate judge's role reduced to that of a mere dress rehearser if a party were allowed to \nfeint and weave at the initial hearing, and save its knockout punch for the second round . . \n. Equally impor tant, requiring the district court to hear evidence not previously presented \nto the magistrate judge might encourage sandbagging. [I]t would be fundamentally unfair \nto permit a litigant to set its case in motion before the magistrate, wait to see which way  \nthe wind was blowing, and —having received an unfavorable recommendation —shift gears \nbefore the district judge.”) ; United States v. Reyna -Tapia , 328 F.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. \n2003) (“Finally, it merits re -emphasis that the underlying purpose of the Federal  \nMagistrates Act is to improve the effective administration of justice.”) . \n Assuming that there has been no waiver, the Court has conducted a de novo  review  \nas to Defendant ’s objections .  See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C) (“ Within fourteen days after \nbeing served with [the Report and Recommendation] , any party may serve and file written \nobjections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court. \nA judge of the court shall make a de novo  determinati on of those portions of the report or \n \nCourt exercises its discretion to not consider those matters and considers them waived” \neven though, according to Ramos, the case raised no w aiver issue. But this argument misses \nthe point. The fact that the order contained extraneous language does not negate the district \ncourt's multiple assertions that it conducted de novo review  and the magistrate judge's \nproper analysis in recommending deni al of the motion to suppress.”).  \n Case 4:22-cv-00269-JAS-MSA   Document 34   Filed 09/28/23   Page 2 of 11 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made. A judge of \nthe court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or \nrecommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judg e may also receive further \nevidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions. ”). \nIn addition to reviewing the Report and Recommendation and any objections and \nresponsive briefing thereto, t he Court’s  de novo  review includes review o f the record and \nauthority before United States Magistrate Judge Martinez  which led to the Report and \nRecommendation in this case ; for example, the Court’s de novo  review included the First \nAmended Complaint ( Doc. 21, filed January 6, 2023 ), Defendant ’s motion to dismiss  (Doc. \n26, filed February 21, 202 3), the response   to the motion i n question  (Doc. 27 , filed march \n7, 2023) , the reply to motion in question  (Doc . 28, filed on March 14, 2023) , the Repo rt \nand Recommendation (R & R)  (Doc. 30, filed on S eptember 9, 2023 ), the  objection to R \n& R (Doc. 31, filed on September 15, 2023) , and the response to the objection  (Doc. 33, \nfiled on September 20, 2023) . (The “Affidavit ” filed at Doc. 32 is a duplicate of Doc. 33 \nand was filed in err or.) Magistrate Judge Martinez did not conduct a hearing on \nDefendant ’s motion  as no party requested one. Further,  this Court finds briefing  on the \nMotion to Dismiss  was adequate and oral argument would not have helped in resolving the \nmatter . See Mahon v. Credit Bureau of Placer County, Inc. , 171 F.3d 1197, 1200 -1201 (9th \nCir. 1999).  The same is true of the R & R.  \n Upon de novo  review  of the record and authority herein, the Court finds Defendant’s  \nobjections to be without merit, rejects those obj ections, and adopts United States \nMagistrate Judge Martine z’s Report and Recommendation.  See, e.g., United States v. \nRodriguez , 888 F.2d 519, 522 (7th Cir. 1989) (“Rodriguez is entitled by statute to de novo  \nreview of the subject. Under Raddatz [447 U.S.  667 (1980)] the court may provide this on \nthe record compiled by the magistrate. Rodriguez treats adoption of the magistrate's report \nas a sign that he has not received his due. Yet we see no reason to infer abdication from \nadoption. On occasion this cour t affirms a judgment on the basis of the district court's \nopinion. Affirming by adoption does not imply that we have neglected our duties; it means, Case 4:22-cv-00269-JAS-MSA   Document 34   Filed 09/28/23   Page 3 of 11 \n- 4 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n rather, that after independent review we came to the same conclusions as the district judge \nfor the reasons  that judge gave, rendering further explanation otiose. When the district \njudge, after reviewing the record in the light of the objections to the report, reaches the \nmagistrate's conclusions for the magistrate's reasons, it makes sense to adopt the report,  \nsparing everyone another round of paper.”) ; Bratcher v. Bray -Doyle Independent School \nDist. No. 42 of Stephens County, Okl. , 8 F.3d 722, 724 (10th Cir. 1993) (“ De novo  review \nis statutorily and constitutionally required when written objections to a magist rate's report \nare timely filed with the district court . . . The district court's duty in this regard is satisfied \nonly by considering the actual testimony [or other relevant evidence in the record], and not \nby merely reviewing the magistrate's report and recommendations . . . On the other hand, \nwe presume the district court knew of these requirements, so the express references to de \nnovo  review in its order must be taken to mean it properly considered the pertinent portions \nof the record, absent some clear  indication otherwise . . . Plaintiff contends . . .   the district \ncourt's [terse] order indicates the exercise of less than de novo  review . . . [However,] \nbrevity does not warrant look[ing] behind a district court's express statement that it engaged \nin a de novo  review of the record.”) ; Murphy v. International Business Machines Corp. , 23 \nF.3d 719, 722 (2nd Cir. 1994) (“We . . . reject Murphy's procedural challenges to the \ngranting of summary judgment . . . Murphy's contention that the district judge did n ot \nproperly consider her objections to the magistrate judge's report . . . lacks merit. The judge's \nbrief order mentioned that objections had been made and overruled. We do not construe \nthe brevity of the order as an indication that the objections were not  given due \nconsideration, especially in light of the correctness of that report and the evident lack of \nmerit in Murphy's objections.”) ; Gonzales -Perez v. Harper , 241 F.3d 633 (8th Cir. 2001) \n(“When a party timely objects to a magistrate judge's report and  recommendation, the \ndistrict court is required to make a de novo  review of the record related to the objections, \nwhich requires more than merely reviewing the report and recommendation . . .

See, e.g., United States v. Ramos , - F.4th -, 2023 WL \n \n3 See also Pinkston v. Madry , 440 F.3d 879, 893 -894 (7th Cir. 2006) ( “the district court's \nassurance, in a written order, that the court has complied with the de novo review \nrequirements of the statute in reviewing the magistrate judge's proposed findings and \nrecommendation is sufficient, in all but the most extraordinary of  cases, to resist assault on \nappeal ”; emphasizing that “[i]t is clear that Pinkston's argument in this regard is nothing \nmore than a collateral attack on the magistrate's reasoning, masquerading as an assault on \nthe district court's entirely acceptable dec ision to adopt the magistrate's opinion . . .”) ; \nGarcia v. City of Albuquerque , 232 F.3d 760 (10th Cir. 2000) (“The district court's order \nis terse . . . However, neither 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) nor Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b) requires the \ndistrict court to make any specific findings; the district court must merely conduct a de \nnovo  review of the record . . .   It is common practice among district judges . . . to [issue a \nterse order stating that it conducted a de novo  review as to objections] . . . and adopt the \nmagis trate judges' recommended dispositions when they find that magistrate judges have \ndealt with the issues fully and accurately and that they could add little of value to that \nanalysis. We cannot interpret the district court's [terse] statement as establishin g that it \nfailed to perform the required de novo  review . . . We hold that although the district court's \ndecision is terse, this is insufficient to demonstrate that the court failed to review the \nmagistrate's recommendation de novo .”); Goffman v.

In light of these \nassumptions for the HDJ, the  numbers would be as follows:  (1) After 1 year, there would \nbe 30 HO’s  from this one HDJ t hat look largely identical as they  primarily cover  the same \nlaw and case management procedures; ( 2) After  5 years, there would be 150 HO’s  from \nthis one HDJ that look largely identical as they primarily cover the same law and case \nmanagement procedures ; (3) After 10 years, there would be 300 HO’s from this one HDJ \nthat look largely identical as they primarily cover the same law and case management \nprocedures ; (4) After 20 years, there would be 600 HO’s from this one HDJ that look \nlargely identical  as they primarily cover the same law and case management procedures ; \nand (5) After 30 years  on the bench (at age 90 , achy  and ready to retire, the HDJ is \nhereinafter referred to as Super  Old Hypothetical District Judge – “SOHDJ”) , there would \nbe 900 HO’s from this one  SOHDJ  that look largely identical as they primarily cover the \nsame law and case management procedures .  While some may disapprove  of the 900 HO’s \nfrom this one SOHDJ that look largely identical as they primarily cover the same law and \ncase ma nagement procedures , the 900 HO’s from this one SOHDJ  nonetheless would fully \ncomply with published legal authority . The SOHDJ  certainly  could have:  (1) string cited \n20 different cases for the same legal standard in all 900 HO’s (i.e., 900 HO’s , times 20  new \nstring cites , equals 18,000 different cases cited for the same legal standard over the course \nof a 30 year career ); and (2) discussed the same legal standards  and case management \npractice  in 900 different ways .  The SOHDJ  ruminates that maybe if he did this, all would \ngive credence to his certification in his 900 HO’s that he conducted the required de novo \nreview as repeatedly stated in his HO’s over the last 30 years.  Perhaps, the SOHDJ  thinks, \nmaybe he should draft a who lly unique Order covering all the same issues that were already \ncorrectly addressed in the R & R  to further lend credence to his certification that he \nconducted a de novo  review.  However, the SOHDJ  also thinks  that maybe some will \nnonetheless think : that he simply scanned the entire case record into Chat GPT  (which Case 4:22-cv-00269-JAS-MSA   Document 34   Filed 09/28/23   Page 6 of 11 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n The Court’s case management practices are also consistent with numerous unpublished \nNinth Circuit cases.  See, e.g., United States v. Drapel , 418 F. App'x 630, 630 -31 (9th Cir. \n2011); Brook v. McCormley , 837 F. App'x 433, 435 -36 (9th Cir. 2020); Payne v. \nMarsteiner , No. 21 -55296, 2022 WL 256357, at *1 (9th Cir. 2022).   \nIn addition to being compliant with Ninth Circuit authority and the relevant statutory \nscheme, the Court’s case management practices are similarly consistent with authority \nfrom numerous oth er circuits, including the First Circuit, Second Circuit, Fifth Circuit, \nEighth Circuit, and Tenth Circuit.  See, e.g., Elmendorf Grafica, Inc. v. D.S. Am. (E.), Inc. , \n48 F.3d 46, 49 -50 (1st Cir. 1995); Murphy v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp. , 23 F.3d 719, 722 ( 2d \nCir. 1994); Brunig v. Clark , 560 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir. 2009); United States v. Jones , 22 \nF.4th 667, 679 (7th Cir. 2022); Gonzales -Perez v. Harper , 241 F.3d 633, 636 -37 (8th Cir. \n2001); Garcia v. City of Albuquerque , 232 F.3d 760, 766 (10th Cir. 2000).    \nAs to each and every individual case before the Court  (past, present, and future) , the \nCourt consciously conducts the de novo  review required of the Court .  Oftentimes, as the \nUnited States Magistrate Judge is a neutral arbiter of the law and facts (sim ilar to the Court, \nand unlike parties who represent opposing factual and legal assertions), the Court (after \nconducting the required de novo  review) agrees with a Report and Recommendation’s \nanalysis as it correctly resolves the pertinent issues; in these circumstances, the Court issues \nan Order akin to this Order (i.e., an Order that  discusses the pertinent legal standards and \nstates that the Court conducted the required de novo review pursuant to those legal \nstandards).  Thus, if the applicable law has no t changed and the Court’s case management \npractices have not changed, the Court does not unnecessarily venture anew (in each \n \nscored in the 90th percentile on the bar exam)  and advanced  artificial intelligence wrote  the \nOrder ; or maybe he only read the objections  and R & R  (not the underlying briefing and \nhearing transc ript); or maybe he was not fully concentrating while reading the underlying \nrecord as he was preoccupied with what the early bird special was at IHOP.   Perhaps, the \nSOHDJ thought, even though his de novo  review certifications (in full compliance with \npublished authority)  came without the proverbial  ribbons,  tags, packages , boxes  or bags, \nmaybe perhaps, his SOHDJ de novo  review certifications mean a little bit more. Alas, while \nthe beleaguered SOHDJ  could have disingenuously cited 18,000 different cases for the \nsame controlling legal standards and stated the same legal standards and case management \npractice in 900 different ways , the SOHDJ  stood firm in his conviction this was not sound \nand effective case management practice for this particular SOHDJ .

Williams, et al. – a case involving 19 \ndefendants alleging a wide -ranging conspiracy involving murder, assaults, and drug \ndistribution) ( compare Doc. 2130 - 10/7/22 Order Rejecting  Report and Recommendation \n[U.S. v. Moore , - F. Supp. 3d -, 2022 WL 5434268 (D. Ariz. Oct. 7, 2022)] with Doc. 2361 \n– 3/24/23 Order Adopting  Report and Recommendation [ U.S. v. Rakestraw , 2023 WL \n2624461 (D. Ariz. Mar. 24, 2023)]).   \nThe Court also notes that it is  in the Tucson Division of the United States District Court  \nfor the District of Arizona  (i.e., in a border town on the U.S. -Mexico border); consequently, \nthere is a very high criminal case load6 (on top of many civil cases as well).  In any given \n \n5 In adopting a Report and Recommendation, none of the applicable authority prohibits the \nCourt from issuing Order s that incorporate: the Court’s previous, exhaustive, and correct \ndiscussion of the appli cable legal standards (including numerous cases and quotes directly \nsupporting the Court’s practices), what exactly is required of the Court to comply with \nthose applicable legal standards, and how the Court consistently proceeds to follow those \napplicable  legal standards ; rather, it is consistent with the purposes of the Federal \nMagistrate Act to proceed in such a manner as it decreases the time spent on issues that \nhave previously and correctly been discussed by the Court, and  increases the time that can \nbe spent on substantive and novel issues  in the many cases before the Court – this ultimately \nimproves the effective administration of justice .  See United States v. Reyna -Tapia , 328 \nF.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003) (“Finally, it merits re -emphasis that the  underlying purpose \nof the Federal Magistrates Act is to improve the effective administration of justice.”) .   \n6 Pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act which applies to criminal cases, these  cases typically \nmove at a rapid pace  compared to civil cases (the Speed y Trial Act is inapplicable to civil \ncases) .  See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1) ( “[T]he trial of a defendant charged in an information \nor indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from \nthe filing date (and making public) of t he information or indictment, or from the date the \ndefendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is Case 4:22-cv-00269-JAS-MSA   Document 34   Filed 09/28/23   Page 8 of 11 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n week, for example, the Court may be in the midst of a criminal  (or civil)  jury trial, while \nalso preparing for the next string of scheduled jury trials coming in the subsequent weeks , \nand reviewing a voluminous record and drafting a time -sensitive civil Order in a n \nemergency environmental dispute involving the Rosemont copper mine ( see Ctr. For Bio. \nDiversity v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv ., 409 F.Supp.3d 738 (D. Ariz. 2019)), and also \npreparing for and holding numerous sentencing hearings.   By proceeding in the ca se \nmanagement manner discussed herein, this Court is able to invest less time in assiduously \ndiscussing why it agrees (after the required de novo review) with the already correct \nanalysis in a Report and Recommendation, and can invest more time in presidin g over jury \ntrials, preparing for upcoming trials, preparing for and presiding over sentencing hearings, \npreparing for and presiding over oral arguments and evidentiary hearings, and preparing \nfor and drafting unique Orders (in non -referred matters) in cri minal and civil cases.  \n  Simply put, the Court must divide its time between simultaneous, competing demands; \nthe Court must exercise its case management discretion in a way that the Court deems most \neffective and appropriate in light of the many cases befo re the Court.  If the Court finds \n(after the required de novo  review) that a Report and Recommendation properly resolved \nthe pertinent issues, the Court issues an Order akin to this Order; in such circumstances, \nfor example, it would be an ineffective use of this particular Court’s limited time (in each \nand every of the hundreds of individual cases before the Court) t o rehash  what the Report \nand Recommendation already properly discussed such as: what’s alleged in the Indictment \nor Complaint, the procedural history of the case, what the parties argued in a motion to \nsuppress or motion for summary judgment (and the corresponding responses and replies), \nwho said what at an evidentiary hearing (and why certain evidence was or was not \ncredible), and an in -depth d iscussion of the controlling law (and the parties’ competing \ninterpretations of the law).  Furthermore, this Court exercises its discretion and does not \nconsider issues that could have and should have been raised before the United States \nMagistrate Judge; as such, any procedurally proper objections (and corresponding \n \npending, whichever date last occurs. ”).

This Court could  \ncertainly  rehash the underlying procedural history, facts, and law  and individual ly analyze  \nevery  single  objection  in great  detail in a unique Order leading to its de novo determination \nthat the  Report and Recommendation  is ultimately correct ; however, as already explaine d, \nthe Court considers this to be an unwise use of this Court ’s limited  time and resources.  \nRather,  this Court exercises its case management discretion to adopt Report s and \nRecommendations in Orders akin to this Order  (which has occurred on numerous occas ions \nin the past and will occur in the future)  which is  in full  compliance with authority from the \nNinth Circuit, the applicable statutory scheme, and numerous other federal circuit courts.   \nSee, e.g., United  States v. Reyna -Tapia , 328 F.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003) (“Finally, it \nmerits re -emphasis that the underlying purpose of the Federal Magistrates Act is to improve \nthe effective administration of justice.”) ; United States v.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The court opinion dismisses Christopher M Salisbury's amended petition for writ of habeas corpus, denies his motion for injunctive relief, and denies his motion for default judgment. The court agrees with Magistrate Judge Aguilera's Report and Recommendation, continuing a long-standing practice of not considering issues not properly raised initially, to streamline court efficiency.\n   \n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the district court should accept new evidence and arguments in a habeas corpus petition not previously presented to a magistrate judge.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court dismisses the petition and denies all related motions, emphasizing adherence to established procedures that support efficient case management and the proper role of magistrate judges in alleviating district court workloads.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine if a teacher handed out report cards, and a student asked to add new grades right before they were finalized. The court said, \"Nope, we can't allow last-minute changes!\" They agreed with the helper teacher (the magistrate) and said the report was fine just as it is, dismissing all of the student's last-minute requests.",

The Report and Recommendation recommends Denying and \ndismissing with prejudice Petitioner’s amended petition for writ of habeas corpus (Doc. 6), \ndenying Petitioner’s motion for injunctive relief (Doc. 3), and denying Petitioner’s motion \nfor default judgment (Doc. 19).  Petitioner filed objections to the Report and \nRecommendation.1 \n As a threshold matter, as to any new evidence, arguments, and issues that were not \ntimely and properly raised before United States Magistrate Aguilera, the Court exercises \nits discretion to not consider those matters and considers them waived.2  See United States \n \n1 Unless otherwise noted by the Court, internal quotes and citations have been omitted \nwhen citing authority throughout this Order.  \n2 As a general matter, the Court notes that it has had numerous problems with parties in \nmany cases attempting to raise new i ssues that could have been raised before the United \nStates Magistrate Judge.  The Court does not abide such actions, and allowing such actions \nundermines the Court’s ability to properly manage the hundreds of cases pending before \nthe Court.  See United Sta tes v.

But this argument mis ses \nthe point.

A judge of \nthe court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or \nrecommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge may also receive further \nevidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions. ”). \nIn addi tion to reviewing the Report and Recommendation and any objections and \nresponsive briefing thereto, the Court’s de novo  review includes review of the record and \nauthority before United States Magistrate Judge Aguilera which led to the Report and \nRecommenda tion in this case; for example, the Court’s de novo  review included the \npetitioner for writ of habeas corpus (Doc. 1), the amended petition for writ of habeas corpus \n(Doc. 6 (titled: first amended complaint)), Defendant’s Answer (Doc. 16), Petitioner’s \n“reply in opposition to the government’s response” (Doc. 23 (which appears to be a \nresponse to Defendant’s answer)), Petitioner’s motion for injunctive relief (Doc. 3), \nPetitioner’s application for entry of default judgment (Doc. 19), Petitioner’s declaration  \naccompanying his application for default (Doc. 20), and Defendant’s response to the \napplication for default (Doc. 19) . The Court has reviewed Judge Aguilera’s R&R (Doc. \n25), Petitioner’s objection (Doc. 28), and Defendant’s reply (Doc. 29). Despite Petiti oner \nhaving never sought leave to file a sur -reply, the Court also reviewed Petitioner’s additional \nfiling (Doc. 30).   \n Upon de novo  review of the record and authority herein, the Court finds Petitioner’s  \nobjections to be without merit, rejects those objec tions, and adopts United States \nMagistrate Judge Aguilera’s  Report and Recommendation.  See, e.g., United States v. \nRodriguez , 888 F.2d 519, 522 (7th Cir. 1989) (“Rodriguez is entitled by statute to de novo  \nreview of the subject. Under Raddatz [447 U.S. 667 (1980)] the court may provide this on \nthe record compiled by the magistrate. Rodriguez treats adoption of the magistrate's report \nas a sign that he has not received his due. Yet we see no reason to infer abdication from \nadoption.

April 10, 2023) (“Under this statutory sche me [of the Federal \nMagistrates Act], the district court did what § 636(b) requires: it indicated that it reviewed \nthe record de novo, found no merit to Ramos's objections, and summarily adopted the \nmagistrate judge's analysis in his report and recommendation. We have presumed that \ndistrict courts conduct proper de novo review where they state they have done so, even if \nthe order fails to specifically address a party's objections.”); Wang v. Masaitis , 416 F.3d \n992, 1000 (9th Cir. 2005) (same); Holder v. Holder , 392 F.3d 1009, 1022 (9th Cir. 2004) \n(same); N. Am. Watch Corp. v. Princess Ermine Jewels , 786 F.2d 1447, 1450 (9th Cir. \n1986) (same).4   \n \n4 As a purely hypothetical exercise, suppose that a United States District Judge in the \nDistrict of Arizona in the Tucson Division (or any other District Court throughout the entire \ncountry) has approximatel y 300 cases at any point in time.  Suppose that the Hypothetical \nDistrict Judge (“HDJ”) adopts a Hypothetical United States Magistrate Judge’s (“HMJ”) \nReport and Recommendation (“R & R”) in 10% of the 300 constantly revolving cases each \nyear while on the b ench as a HDJ from the age of 60 to 90.  Suppose that the HDJ reviewed \nall applicable published authority, and in full compliance with that published authority \nissued a Hypothetical Order (“HO”) (string citing and quoting 20 published cases directly \non poi nt - for the hypothetical, it matters not whether the  HO is 1 paragraph, 1 page, 10 \npages, or 100 pages ) adopting an R & R where the HO indicate s that it reviewed the record \nde novo , found no merit to  a parties’  objections, and summarily adopted the HMJ 's analysis \nin the R &R (and the HO does not specifically address a party's objections  as it is a non -\nexistent legal requirement according to a plethora of published authority). In light of these \nassumptions for th e HDJ, the numbers would be as follows:  (1) After 1 year, there would \nbe 30 HO’s from this one HDJ that look largely identical as they primarily cover the same \nlaw and case management procedures; (2) After  5 years, there would be 150 HO’s  from \nthis one HD J that look largely identical as they primarily cover the same law and case \nmanagement procedures ; (3) After 10 years, there would be 300 HO’s from this one HDJ \nthat look largely identical as they primarily cover the same law and case management \nprocedures ; (4) After 20 years, there would be 600 HO’s from this one HDJ that look \nlargely identical  as they primarily cover the same law and case management procedures; \nand (5) After 30 years on the bench (at age 90, achy and ready to retire, the HDJ is \nhereinafte r referred to as Super Old Hypothetical District Judge – “SOHDJ”), there would \nbe 900 HO’s from this one SOHDJ that look largely identical as they primarily cover the \nsame law and case management procedures .  While some may disapprove of the 900 HO’s \nfrom this one SOHDJ that look largely identical as they primarily cover the same law and \ncase management procedures , the 900 HO’s from this one SOHDJ nonetheless would fully \ncomply with published legal authority. The SOHDJ certainly could have:  (1) string cite d \n20 different cases for the same legal standard in all 900 HO’s (i.e., 900 HO’s, times 20 new \nstring cites, equals 18,000 different cases cited for the same legal standard over the course Case 4:23-cv-00109-JAS   Document 31   Filed 03/29/24   Page 6 of 11 \n- 7 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n The Court’s case management practices are also consistent with numerous unpublished \nNinth Circuit cases.  See, e.g., United States v. Drapel , 418 F. App'x 630, 630 -31 (9th Cir. \n2011); Brook v. McCormley , 837 F. App'x 433, 435 -36 (9th Cir. 2020); Payne v. \nMarsteiner , No. 21 -55296, 2022 WL 256357, at *1 (9th Cir. 2022).   \nIn addition to being compliant with Ninth Circuit authority and the relevant statutory \nscheme, the  Court’s case management practices are similarly consistent with authority \nfrom numerous other circuits, including the First Circuit, Second Circuit, Fifth Circuit, \nEighth Circuit, and Tenth Circuit.  See, e.g., Elmendorf Grafica, Inc. v. D.S. Am. (E.), In c., \n48 F.3d 46, 49 -50 (1st Cir. 1995); Murphy v. Int'l Bus. Machs. Corp. , 23 F.3d 719, 722 (2d \nCir. 1994); Brunig v. Clark , 560 F.3d 292, 295 (5th Cir. 2009); United States v. Jones , 22 \nF.4th 667, 679 (7th Cir. 2022); Gonzales -Perez v. Harper , 241 F.3d 633, 636 -37 (8th Cir. \n2001); Garcia v. City of Albuquerque , 232 F.3d 760, 766 (10th Cir. 2000).   \nAs to each and every individual case before the Court  (past, present, and future) , the \nCourt consciously conducts the de novo  review required of th e Court .  Oftentimes, as the \nUnited States Magistrate Judge is a neutral arbiter of the law and facts (similar to the Court, \nand unlike parties who represent opposing factual and legal assertions), the Court (after \nconducting the required de novo  review) a grees with a Report and Recommendation’s \nanalysis as it correctly resolves the pertinent issues; in these circumstances, the Court issues \n \nof a 30 year career); and (2) discussed the same legal standards an d case management \npractice in 900 different ways.  The SOHDJ  ruminates that maybe if he did this, all would \ngive credence to his certification in his 900 HO’s that he conducted the required de novo \nreview as repeatedly stated in his HO’s over the last 30 y ears.  Perhaps, the SOHDJ thinks, \nmaybe he should draft a wholly unique Order covering all the same issues that were already \ncorrectly addressed in the R & R to further lend credence to his certification that he \nconducted a de novo  review.  However, the SO HDJ also thinks  that maybe some will \nnonetheless think: that he simply scanned the entire case record into ChatGPT (which \nscored in the 90th percentile on the bar exam) and advanced artificial intelligence wrote the \nOrder; or maybe he only read the objecti ons and R & R (not the underlying briefing and \nhearing transcript); or maybe he was not fully concentrating while reading the underlying \nrecord as he was preoccupied with what the early bird special was at IHOP.  Perhaps, the \nSOHDJ thought, even though his  de novo  review certifications (in full compliance with \npublished authority) came without the proverbial ribbons, tags, packages, boxes or bags, \nmaybe perhaps, his SOHDJ de novo  review certifications mean a little bit more. Alas, while \nthe beleaguered SOHDJ could have disingenuously cited 18,000 different cases for the \nsame controlling legal standards and stated the same legal standards and case management \npractice in 900 different ways , the SOHDJ stood firm in his conviction this was not sound \nand effe ctive case management practice for this particular SOHDJ.  Case 4:23-cv-00109-JAS   Document 31   Filed 03/29/24   Page 7 of 11 \n- 8 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n an Order akin to this Order (i.e., an Order that  discusses the pertinent legal standards and \nstates that the Court con ducted the required de novo review pursuant to those legal \nstandards).  Thus, if the applicable law has not changed and the Court’s case management \npractices have not changed, the Court does not unnecessarily venture anew (in each \nindividual case  – numberi ng in the hundreds ) to newly string cite dozens of different cases \nthat state the same standards, nor does the Court attempt to re -word or re -phrase the many  \nquotes from those cases ( which state the controlling legal standards); nor does the Court \nattempt to re -word or re -phrase the Court’s consistent case management practice which \ncomplies with all applicable legal standards.5  Often, the Court agrees with a Report and \nRecommendation and issues an Order akin to the current Order  (as has happened on \nnumero us occasions in the past and will occur in the future) ; sometimes, the Court \ndisagrees with a Report and Recommendation and issues an Order completely unique to \nthat individual case as the Court needs to further explain the reasoning for its disagreement.  \nSee 4:18-cr-01695 (Doc. 2130 [ruling in favor of the Plaintiff/Government], Doc.  \n2361[ruling in favor of Defendants]) ( U.S. v. Williams, et al. – a case involving 19 \ndefendants alleging a wide -ranging conspiracy involving murder, assaults, and drug \ndistri bution) ( compare Doc. 2130 - 10/7/22 Order Rejecting  Report and Recommendation \n[U.S. v. Moore , - F. Supp. 3d -, 2022 WL 5434268 (D. Ariz. Oct. 7, 2022)] with Doc. 2361 \n– 3/24/23 Order Adopting  Report and Recommendation [ U.S. v. Rakestraw , 2023 WL \n2624461 ( D. Ariz. Mar. 24, 2023)]).   \nThe Court also notes that it is  in the Tucson Division of the United States District Court  \nfor the District of Arizona  (i.e., in a border town on the U.S. -Mexico border); consequently, \n \n5 In adopting a Report and Recommendation, none of the applicable authority prohibits the \nCourt from issuing Orders that incorporate: the Court’s previous, exhaustive, and correct \ndiscussion of the  applicable legal standards (including numerous cases and quotes directly \nsupporting the Court’s practices), what exactly is required of the Court to comply with \nthose applicable legal standards, and how the Court consistently proceeds to follow those \napplicable legal standards; rather, it is consistent with the purposes of the Federal \nMagistrate Act to proceed in such a manner as it decreases the time spent on issues that \nhave previously and correctly been discussed by the Court, and increases the time tha t can \nbe spent on substantive and novel issues in the many cases before the Court – this ultimately \nimproves the effective administration of justice.  See United States v. Reyna -Tapia , 328 \nF.3d 1114, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003) (“Finally, it merits re -emphasis th at the underlying purpose \nof the Federal Magistrates Act is to improve the effective administration of justice.”) .   Case 4:23-cv-00109-JAS   Document 31   Filed 03/29/24   Page 8 of 11 \n- 9 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n there is a very high criminal case load6 (on top of many civil cases as well).  In any given \nweek, for example, the Court may be in the midst of a criminal  (or civil)  jury trial, while \nalso preparing for the next string of scheduled jury trials coming in the subsequent weeks , \nand reviewing a voluminous record and drafting a time -sensitive civil Order in an \nemergency environmental dispute involving the Rosemont copper mine ( see Ctr. For Bio. \nDiversity v. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv ., 409 F.Supp.3d 738 (D. Ariz. 2019)), and also \npreparing for and holding numerous sentencing hearings.   By proceeding in the case \nmanagement manner discussed herein, this Court is able to invest less time in assiduously \ndiscussing why it agrees (after the required de novo review) with the already correct \nanalysis in a Report and Recommendation, and can invest more time in presiding over jury \ntrials, preparing for upcoming trials, preparing for and presiding over sentencing hearings, \npreparing for and presiding over oral arguments and evidentiary hearings, a nd preparing \nfor and drafting unique Orders (in non -referred matters) in criminal and civil cases.  \n  Simply put, the Court must divide its time between simultaneous, competing demands; \nthe Court must exercise its case management discretion in a way that th e Court deems most \neffective and appropriate in light of the many cases before the Court.  If the Court finds \n(after the required de novo  review) that a Report and Recommendation properly resolved \nthe pertinent issues, the Court issues an Order akin to thi s Order; in such circumstances, \nfor example, it would be an ineffective use of this particular Court’s limited time (in each \nand every of the hundreds of individual cases before the Court) to rehash what the Report \nand Recommendation already properly discu ssed such as: what’s alleged in the Indictment \nor Complaint, the procedural history of the case, what the parties argued in a motion to \nsuppress or motion for summary judgment (and the corresponding responses and replies), \nwho said what at an evidentiary h earing (and why certain evidence was or was not \n \n6 Pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act which applies to criminal cases, these cases typically \nmove at a rapid pace compared to civil cases (the  Speedy Trial Act is inapplicable to civil \ncases).  See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1) (“[T] he trial of a defendant charged in an information \nor indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from \nthe filing date (and making public ) of the information or indictment, or from the date the \ndefendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is \npending, whichever date last occurs. ”).

Furthermore, this Court exercises its discretion and does not \nconsider issues that could have and should have been raised before the United States \nMagistrate Judge; as such, any procedurally proper objections (and corresponding \nresponses thereto) are simply repackaging arguments (as objections) that were already \nproperly considered and rejecte d in the Report and Recommendation. This Court could \ncertainly rehash the underlying procedural history, facts, and law and individually analyze \nevery single objection in great detail in a unique Order leading to its de novo determination \nthat the Report a nd Recommendation is ultimately correct; however, as already explained, \nthe Court considers this to be an unwise use of this Court’s limited time and resources.  \nRather, this Court exercises its case management discretion to adopt Reports and \nRecommendatio ns in Orders akin to this Order (which has occurred on numerous occasions \nin the past and will occur in the future) which is in full compliance with authority from the \nNinth Circuit, the applicable statutory scheme, and numerous other federal circuit court s.  \nSee, e.g., United  States v.

While the case touched on the use of AI and 5G as elements of larger conspiracy theories, these technological aspects were not grounded in any substantiated legal or factual basis.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs adequately stated a claim upon which relief could be granted and established standing under Article III to bring such claims.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the claims with prejudice, citing lack of standing, failure to state a plausible legal claim, and sovereign immunity that protects government officials involved. The court found the plaintiffs' arguments speculative and not supported by concrete facts.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Three people went to court claiming that 5G networks and COVID-19 vaccines were part of a huge plan involving the government and industry to control people. The judge decided that their claims weren't clear or realistic enough to show they suffered any harm because of these things. Also, many of the people they were suing were protected by rules that say you can't just sue the government and its workers unless you have a good reason. The case was dismissed, meaning it was thrown out and couldn't be brought back to court.",
    "full_text": "1 \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nDISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT  \n \nJOHN FLYNN et al. , \n Plaintiff s, \n \n v.  \n VERIZON WIRELESS  et al. , \n Defendants . No. 3:22- cv-1065 (JAM)  \n \nORDER OF DISMISSAL  \nPlaintiffs  John Flynn, Chris Kelly, and Heather Lindsey ha ve filed a pro se  complaint  \nalleging  primarily  that 5G cellular networks pose grave risks to human health and are being used \nas weapons by government and industry to harm and control the public. Because the complaint  \nas amended  does not establish plausible grounds  for the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction and in \nthe alternative fails to allege plausible grounds for relief, I will grant the defendants’ motion s to \ndismiss with prejudice and dismiss  the plaintiffs’ remaining claims  with prejudice . \nBACKGROUND  \nThe following facts are taken from the operative complaint and assumed to be true solely \nfor the purposes of this ruling.1 \nThe p laintiffs  name over 30 defendants, including telecommunications corporations, \nUnited States Senators and Representatives, Connecticut  state and municipal officials , and \nConnecticut  telecommunications and utility companies.2 The 132- page amended complaint \nalleges a sweeping  conspiracy between government and industry to install 5G, subject  the public \nto forced  COVID- 19 vaccinations, and tamper with U.S. elections. Much of the complaint is also \n \n1 Doc. # 247. \n2 Id. at 2, 6-18.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 1 of 152 \n devoted to Flynn’s personal grievances, including his view that he has been labeled a domestic \nterrorist and that he was illegally sabotaged in his campaign for Senator.  \nAccording to the  plaintiffs , “5G is a cell disruptor through radiation ,” and “ evidence \nsuggests [it] is a biological weapon.”3 They claim  that Connecticut installed a 5G grid during the \nCOVI D-19 pandemic in order to “create a one world order and grant control to foreigners of the \nAmerican [e] lections .”4 Specifically , “[t]he same people that are radiating the tri -state area used \nthe 5G and wireless infrastructure to hack the 2020 National Election and the 2022 Senatorial elections.”\n5  \nWith the rollout of 5G, the plaintiffs  believe  that “Ct is building a digital open- air \nconcentration camp , using  . . . surveillance/artificial intelligence learning an d scoring for \ncompliance social credits” that is “[c]ollected on servers in China” and will lead to a system in which “AI will allow the purchase of food with a new [c]urrency based on compliance.”\n6 \nThe p laintiffs also allege a broad array of risks posed by 5G, including that it “will make \nevery child infertile, cancerous, and autistic” and that “ [p]ulsed microwave \nmillimeter/technology can be used for secretive data collection, harvesting, and . . . hacking the human mind and body.”\n7 They add that, during the rollout, “[f]orced Covid injections were given \nthat . . . are not a vaccine.”8 \nThe extensive  complaint contains only a few allegations of harm suffered by the plaintiffs \nthemselves. Flynn states “I have type one diabetes. I am high risk and dis abled ,” and “[t]hese \n \n3 Id. at 19 , 39. \n4 Id. at 19; see id. at 25 (¶¶ 1 -2) (“5G risk was taken for nationwide election hacking. 5g is [g]enocide and \nracketeering including [e]lection FRA[U]D . . . .

Flynn property,” but does not specify what property was stolen or how \nCongressman Himes was involved.10 He next alleges that “CAVU Corporation” denied him \naccess to “the source code used to [h]ack 20 other states” in an election.11 Finally, Flynn claims \nthat the 57,962 signatures he allegedly collected in support of his run for Senat e are “missing.”12  \nThe remainder of the harms to Flynn, Kelly, and Lindsey appear wholly unrelated to 5G, \nthe pandemic, or elections . Flynn claims that Police Chief Brent Larrabee, not a defendant in this \ncase, used a confidential informant to try to kill him, and that Chief Anderson of Darien Police \nlooted nine of Flynn’s bank accounts and “falsified an investigation.”13 He also alleges that state \ncourt marshal Joe Suda “had 5 phones stolen from US Republican Candidate Flynn,” while  \nSuda’s brother , Mark , threatened Flynn in August 2023.14 Next, he  claims  that the “CT State \nPolice allowed 1,239 cashed stolen checks of Flynn [sic]. ”15 Finally, Flynn complains of being \nlabeled a domestic terrorist by various individuals and entities .16 \nKelly and Lindsey claim to have been victimized in various ways by a Dr. Ahuja and his \nbrother, Mike, and then repeatedly denied protective or ders.17 Kelly also claims that a \nprosecutor, Larry Tamaccio, refused to arrest Mike after he threatened to shoot Kelly.18 Lindsey \n \n9 Id. at 55 (¶ 90) , 60 (¶ 115) . \n10 Id. at 7. \n11 Id. at 9 (¶ 14).  \n12 Id. at 4; see id. 17, 24, 40.   \n13 Id. at 15. \n14 Id. at 16-17. \n15 Id. at 42 (¶ 22).  \n16 Id. at 12, 15, 42 (¶ 20), 53 (¶¶ 76 -77), 113 . \n17 Id. at 15-16, 21 -22, 29  (¶ 25), 52 (¶ 69).  \n18 Id. at 15.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 3 of 154 \n adds that a nother  prosecutor, Mike Bavona , prevented police from arresting Mike Ahuja after \nAhuja  allegedly raped her.19  \nFlynn filed his initial complaint in Connecticut state court, and it was subsequently \nremoved to federal court, where several defendants filed motions to dismiss.20 I granted these \nmotions  and dismissed the remaining claims and defendants without prejudice. See Flynn v. \nVerizon Wireless, 2023 WL 5153635 (D. Conn. 2023). In that ruling, I outlined various \nparameters that would govern any amended complaint Flynn might wish to file. These included the requirement that he set forth facts showing how each defendant proximately caused a concrete, particularized harm to each pla intiff; that each claim of injury cite the provision of law \nthat was allegedly violated; and that any amended complaint take into account arguments defendants raised in their motions , including the preemption of state law claims by federal law. \nId. at *5- 6.\n21 \nSeveral defendants have once again  filed motions to dismiss.22 This ruling conducts a  sua \nsponte review  of the amended complaint before addressing the pending motions .  \nDISCUSSION  \nThis Court has authority to sua sponte  review and dismiss a complaint if it is “frivolous \nor malicious ,” “fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted ,” or “seeks monetary relief \nagainst a defendant who is immune from such relief.”  See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). \n \n19 Id. at 15.  \n20 See Docs. #1, #79, #81, #86, #113.  \n21 I also advised Flynn that he must file any amended complaint on or before September 1, 2023, and that the Court \nwould grant him only one opportunity to amend. Flynn , 2023 WL 5153635,  at *6. He filed an amended complaint \nand a motion for l eave to file on August 15. Docs. #238, 237.  On August 30, I granted his motion for leave and \nadvised him that the August 15 complaint would be operative unless he filed a superseding amended complaint on \nor before September 1.  Doc. #244.  The following day,  Flynn filed a superseding complaint, which is the operative \ncomplaint for purposes of this ruling . Doc. #247.  Although Flynn has since filed multiple more amended complaints, \nI decline to consider them because they were filed without good cause after the date that was set for him to file an \namended complaint.  \n22 See Docs. #255, #257, #258, #260, #281.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 4 of 155 \n Additionally, “ [b]ecause constitutional standing implicates the subject matter jurisdiction of the \nCourt,” it can be addressed sua sponte . In re Clinton Nurseries, Inc. , 53 F.4th 15, 22 (2d Cir. \n2022); see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3)  (“If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject -\nmatter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.”).23 \nBecause Flynn is a  pro se  plaintiff, t he Court liberally construes the pleadings to raise the \nstrongest arguments that they suggest. See, e.g., Publicola v. Lomenzo, 54 F.4th 108, 111 (2d Cir. \n2022) ( per curiam ). Still, a pro se  complaint may not survive dismissal if its factual allegations \ndo not meet the basic plausibility standard. See Meadows v. United Servs., Inc., 963 F.3d 240, \n243 (2d Cir. 2020) ( per curiam ). \n Additional plaintiffs  \nAs a preliminary matter, Flynn has named as additional plaintiffs Phil Marie, Heather \nLindsey, Chris Kelly, and “97 John and Jane [D]oes.”24 But only Flynn, Lindsey, and Kelly have  \nsigned the complaint.25 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(a) (requiring every pleading to “be signed . . . by a \nparty personally if the party is unrepresented ”). As the Court has explained repeatedly, including \nin its ruling dismissing the initial complaint, Flynn does not have authority to represent third \nparties and add them as co- plaintiffs because he is not an attorney.26 See Gottlieb v. Tyler , 795 F. \nApp’x 82, 83 (2d Cir. 2020) (“[A] non- attorney is not allowed to represent another individual in \nfederal court litigation without the assistan ce of counsel.”) (quoting Berrios v. New York City \nHous . Auth ., 564 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir. 2009) ). Accordingly, I evaluate the adequacy of the \ncomplaint solely with respect to those who have signed it  as pro se litigants —Flynn, Kelly, and \nLindsey—and not any other putative plaintiffs . \n \n23 Unless otherwise noted and for ease of reading, this ruling omits all internal quotations, brackets, and derivative \ncitations for all quotations from cases . \n24 Doc. #247 at 1.  \n25 Id. at 1, 2.  \n26 See Docs. #122 , #183; Flynn , 2023 WL 5153635, at *2 . Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 5 of 156 \n Flynn’s claims  \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to “Cases” \nand “Controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. “To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff \nmust show (1) an injury in fact, (2) a sufficient causal co nnection between the injury and the \nconduct complained of, and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus , 573 U.S. 149, 157- 58 (2014); Picard v. Magliano, \n42 F.4th 89, 97 (2d Cir. 2022). A n injury- in-fact must be “concrete and particularized and actual \nor imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Susan B. Anthony List , 573 U.S. at 158. A  \nconcrete injury is one that “must actually exist” —it must be “real and not abstract.”  Spokeo, Inc. \nv. Robins , 578 U.S. 330, 340 (2016).   \nFlynn alleges that he is “high risk and disabled” and that the defendants “changed [his] \nenvironment and knowingly radiated every person in the state of CT.”\n27 But, as was the case in \nhis initial complaint,  he has  once again failed to articulate any harm he himself has suffered as a \nresult, whether actual or imminent. H is claims that 5G causes cancer, infertility, and autism \nappear to be based entirely on speculation. And e ven if they were rooted in something more t han \nconjecture, he offers no details about any injury that he himself has suffered. See Faculty v. New York Univ. , 11 F.4th 68, 75 (2d Cir. 2021)  (“[S]tanding is not an ingenious academic exercise in \nthe conceivable but requires a factual showing of percep tible harm.”).  \nThus , Flynn has no standing to bring a claim based on his susceptibility to any alleged \nradiation. See , e.g., Strunk v. New York, 2019 WL 5788560, at *5- 6 (N.D.N.Y. 2019) (plaintiff \nlacked standing to challenge defendants’ implementation of 4G and 5G networks where he was \n“not seeking to remedy any personal and tangible harm” but instead “attempt[ing] to vindicate \n \n27 Doc. #247  at 55 (¶ 90), 60 (¶ 115).  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 6 of 157 \n his own idiosyncratic worldview by weighing in on various government policies”). Accordingly, \nI will dismiss all claims premised on radiation pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).  \nSimilarly, Flynn’s  allegation that CAVU Corporation denied him access to a “ source \ncode ” purportedly used to “hack” states in an election fails to specify how he was harmed by this \nrefusal. Cf. TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , 594 U.S. 413, 442 (2021) (“An asserted informational \ninjury that causes no adverse effects cannot satisfy Article III.”). S o even if Flynn could show \nthat CAVU owed him a legal duty to provide the information or violated some provision of law by refusing, Flynn would lack standing to sue. I will dismiss this claim per Rule 12(h)(3). \nFlynn’s next claim, against Congressman Hime s, is barred by sovereign immunity. \n“Absent an unequivocally expressed statutory waiver, the United States, its agencies, and its employees (when functioning in their official capacities) are immune from suit based on the principle of sovereign immunity.” Coritsidis v. Khal Bnei Torah of Mount Ivy , 2024 WL 37122, \nat *3 (S.D.N.Y. 2024) (quoting Cnty. of Suffolk v. Sebelius , 605 F.3d 135, 140 (2d Cir. 2010)). \n“Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing that their claims fall within an applicable waiver,” and \n“[a]ny ambiguity regarding the Government’s consent to be sued must be construed strictly in favor of the sovereign.” Id. at *4. Flynn has made no showing of a waiver. \nTo the extent that the Court construes his  claims against Himes as proceeding against the \nUnited States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which allows the United States to be sued in certain cases, the FTCA “requires that a claimant exhaust all administrative remedies before filing a compl aint in federal district court.”  Searles v. Robert , 2023 WL 7271832, at *1 \n(2d Cir. 2023) (quoting Celestine v. Mount Vernon Neighborhood Health Ctr ., 403 F.3d 76, 82 \n(2d Cir. 2005) ). The exhaustion requirement “is jurisdictional and cannot be waived,”  and it \n“extends to all suits, including those begun in state court .” Celestine, 403 F.3d at 82. Flynn has Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 7 of 158 \n made no showing that he has exhausted his administrative remedies. Accordingly, he  has not \nestablished this Court’s jurisdiction to hear a claim against the United States. See Manchanda v. \nLewis , 2021 WL 5986877, at *2 (2d Cir. 2021) (“[T]he burden is on the plaintiff to both plead \nand prove compliance with the FTCA’s statutory requirements, including exhaustion. In the absence of such compliance, a distri ct court has no subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s \nclaim.”) (quoting In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., 818 F.2d 210, 214 (2d Cir. 1987)). \nTherefore , I will dismiss Flynn’s claims against Himes pursuant to  Rule 12(h)(3) and  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915(e)(2)(B)  for seeking monetary relief against a defendant who is immune.  \nFlynn’s claims related to his Senate candidacy also fail on immunity grounds. He names \nvarious parties purportedly responsible for the missing sign atures of his supporters, from “640 \ntown clerks and registrars” who allegedly “destroyed” the signatures, to “The Secretary of State,” who he claims “stole” them.\n28 He also claims that “CT Secretary of State Mark Kohler \nfalsified the CT 2022 election” and that Flynn gave his signatures “to Taffy Womack and those \npetitions are largely missing.”29 Construing this claim as against the Connecticut Secretary of \nState, it must fail. See Libertarian Party of Erie Cnty. v. Cuomo, 970 F.3d 106, 122 (2d Cir. \n2020) (“ An action against a state official in his official capacity is deemed an action against the \nstate itself.”) (citing Hafer v. Melo , 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991)), abrogated on other grounds by N ew \nYork State Rifle & Pistol Ass’n, Inc. v. Bruen , 597 U.S. 1 (2022). \n“Without a State ’s express waiver or an act by Congress . . . the Eleventh Amendment \nbars federal courts from adjudicating claims against a State, as well as its agencies and agents.” 74 Pinehurst LLC v. New York , 59 F.4th 557, 570 (2d Cir. 2023). As with his claims against the \n \n28 Id. at 17 , 24. \n29 Id. at 28 (¶ 19).  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 8 of 159 \n United States, Flynn has failed to show a waiver or applicable act of Congress that would permit \nthis Court to hear his claims against the Connecticut Secretary of  State or its officials.  \nNor has he stated claims against any individual Connecticut state defendants  in their \npersonal capacities.30 As the Court previously noted, “Connecticut state law provides that ‘[n]o \nstate officer or employee shall be personally liable for damage or injury, not wanton , reckless or \nmalicious, caused in the discharge of his or her duties or within the scope of his or her employment.’” Flynn , 2023 WL 5153635, at *4 (citing Conn. Gen. Stat. § 4- 165(a)) . Flynn has \nonce again failed to show that the  alleged  conduct giving ris e to his claims occurred outside the \ncourse of the  officials’ duties or was beyon d the scope of their authority. See ibid. “[T]herefore \nthese state officials have statutory immunity.” Ibid. Even if Flynn plausibly alleged that the defendants’ conduct was wanton and reckless , this  exception does not extend to claims for \nmonetary damage s. Ibid.  (citing Miller v. Egan , 265 Conn. 301, 319 (2003)). Accordingly, I will \ndismiss all claims against all Connecticut state defendants related to Flynn’s Senate candidacy  \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)  for seeking monetary relief against immune defendants . \nNext, Flynn brings various claims related to his being “labeled” a domestic terrorist. \nFirst, he alleges that U.S. Attorney Vanessa Roberts Avery “[u]sed the Patriot Act to [s]py on \n[d]omestic [p]atriots and called them [d]omestic [t]errorists. I am one.” He arg ues that “[t]he \nSupreme Court is quite clear that people cannot be put on a Terrorist Watch list without a trial.”\n31 This is incorrect  (even assuming that, by “trial,” Flynn means some sort of verification) . \nAlthough the Court, in TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , held that one  could state a claim for being \nincluded on a terrorist list, TransUnion also clarified that  the list must be published or otherwise \n \n30 See id.  at 130 (¶ 2) (“We request a dismissal of the sovereign immunity defense as we sue in their personal \ncapacities.”).  \n31 Id. at 28 (¶ 21).  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 9 of 1510 \n disseminated to third parties. 594 U.S. at 432- 33, 439. Mere inclusion —or “labeling” —is not \nsufficient. See i d. at 442 (“[Those] whose credit reports were not provided to third- party \nbusinesses did not suffer a concrete harm and thus do not have standing.”). Flynn has not alleged \nthat Avery disseminated  any list that included him , nor that she communicated his alleged status \nas a domestic terrorist to anyone in any way. Thus, even assuming Avery  were not protected by \nsovereign immunity, Flynn ha s not established standing.  \nTo the extent he might bring a tort claim based on Avery’s alleged “ spying ,” it would fail \non the same immunity grounds as his claims against Himes.  Accordingly, I will dismiss his \nclaims against Avery pursuant to Rule 12(h)(3)  for lack of standing  and 28 U.S.C. § \n1915(e)(2)(B)  for seeking relief against an immune defendant . \nFlynn also alleges that Darien Police “complained that [he] was a ‘domestic terrorist’ to \nWilliam Maloney, the State banking commission, the State Police and the FBI.”32 But police \ndepartments, as sub -units or agents of municipalities rather than independent legal entities, \ncannot be sued. See Williams v. Hartford Police Dep ’t, 2015 WL 13849474, at  *1 (D. Conn. \n2015) ; Tobin v. Doe , 2005 WL 701274, at *2 (D. Conn. 2005). And although Flynn lists Darien \nPolice Chief Anderson as a defendant, he does not allege any personal involvement by Anderson.\n33 This is a required showing  for any claim Flynn might bring based on being labeled a \nterrorist, whether a constitutional violat ion under § 1983 or a tort claim for defamation. See \nKravitz v. Purcell , 87 F.4th 111, 129 (2d Cir. 2023);  Khan v. Yale Univ., 27 F.4th 805, 817 (2d \nCir. 2022). Accordingly, I will dismiss his claims against Darien polic e and Chief Anderson \n \n32 Id. at 15.  \n33 He also claims someone named Jamie Stevenson labeled him a domestic terrorist. Id. at 53 (¶ 77). But even if \nStevenson were a defendant in this case, Flynn once again fails to allege publication.  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 10 of 1511 \n based on this a lleged conduct  per 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)  for failure to state a claim on which \nrelief may be granted . \nFlynn’s claims against Police Chief Anderson, state marshal Joe Suda, and “CT State \nPolice” are all fatally non -specific.  To survive review under § 1915(e)(2), “a complaint must \ncontain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its \nface.” Grant v. ASPCA , 2022 WL 2669926, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. 2022) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) ). “A claim h as facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual \ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. “While a court must ‘generally accept the truth of a \nplaintiff’s allegations’ at the pleading stage, a complaint that contains labels and conclusions or naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement will not suffice.” Rivas v. New York \nLottery, 2023 WL 2968185, at *5 (N.D.N.Y 2023). \nFlynn claims that  Chief Anderson “looted 9 of Flynn’s bank accounts and falsified an \ninvestigation,” that State court marshal Joe Suda “had 5 phones stolen” from Flynn, and that “CT state police allowed 1,239 cashed stolen checks of Flynn.”\n34 He fails to specify which acco unts \nwere “looted” or what he means by that term, which investigation was falsified and in what way, \nthe manner in which Suda caused the phones to be stolen, or what state police actually did with \nthe checks. Nor does he state when or where any of this con duct occurred. He has thus provided \nthe Court with no plausible basis to infer that the defendants are liable to him. See id. at *5 \n(holding that plaintiff’s description of her colleagu es “screaming and glaring at her  . . . and \nstalking and bullying her ” lacked facial plausibility because she “provide[d] no factual details . . . \n \n34 Id. at 15-16, 42 (¶ 22).  Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 11 of 1512 \n such as who the employees were, what they said, or when or where any of these incidents \noccurred”).  \nFlynn’s  remaining claim s of concrete harm —a supposed attempted murder -for-hire \nscheme and a threatening phone call —are not only wholly unmoored from the general premise  of \nhis complaint, but  are also alleged against individuals who are not defendants in this case: Police \nChief Brent Larrabee and Joe Suda’s brother, Mark. “The Court will disregard the factual allegations in Plaintiff[’s] Amended Complaint regarding non -defendants except to the extent \nthey may have relevance to the claims asserted against the Defendants in this lawsuit.” Henderson v. Fischer, 2015 WL 1413965, at *2 n.2 (N.D.N.Y. 2015); see Cruz v. Lashway, 2009 WL 1734549, at *13 (N.D.N.Y. 2009) (“Plaintiff’s claims against persons not named as Defendants will not be considered by the Court.”). I will therefore dismiss these claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted . \nClaims of Kelly  and Lindsey  \nKelly’s and Lindsey’s alleged harms relate exclusively to two brothers , Dr. Ajay Ahuja  \nand Mike Ahuja. These individuals ar e not named defendants but loom large throughout the \ncomplaint. According to the plaintiffs, Dr. Ahuja operates a “pill mill.”\n35 Kelly and Lindsey both \nclaim he raped them .36 Lindsey also accuses Mike Ahuja of rape.37 \nThey complain repeatedly that Judge Kavenewsky denied them each protective orders —\npresumably against one or both Ahuja brothers.38 They also  claim defendant DA Tamaccio  \nrefused to arrest Mike Ahuja after Ahuja threatened to shoot  Kelly.

The Ahuja brothers are not defendants, \nnor is Judge Kavenewsky. And the judge would be immune from suit based on these allegations even if he  were properly named. See Owens v. Conn., 2024 WL 1576779, at *3 (D. Conn. 2024) \n(“‘It is well settled that judges general ly have absolute immunity from suits for money damages \nfor their judicial actions,’ whether they are sued in their individual or official capacities.” ) \n(quoting Bliven v. Hunt , 579 F.3d 204, 209 (2d Cir. 2009)).  \nIt is not clear what power the district atto rneys, Tamaccio and Bavona, would have to \narrest either Ahuja brother. Construing the claims against them as arising instead from their refusal to prosecute, both DAs are protected by immunity. See McCray v. Patrolman N.A. Caparco, 761 F. App’x 27, 32 (2d Cir. 2019) ( “[A]cts by a prosecutor that are ‘intimately \nassociated with the judicial phase of the criminal process’ are shielded by absolute immunity.”)  \n(quoting Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 430 (1976)). Even if no immunity operated, “a \nprivate citizen does not have a constitutional right to compel government officials to arrest or prosecute another person.” Doe v. Town of Greenwich, 422 F. Supp. 3d 528, 537 (D. Conn. 2019); see Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973) (“[A] private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another.”). Accordingly, I will dismiss Kelly ’s and Lindsey’s claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)  for failure to \nstate a claim and seeking relief from defendants who are immune from such relief . \nFor the reasons stated above , the plaintiffs’  various  alleged harms do not give rise to \nlegally cognizable claims. And although the complaint names many other defendants, none of them have been connected to the harm alleged. Thus, the complaint cannot rest on claims against Case 3:22-cv-01065-JAM   Document 387   Filed 05/23/24   Page 13 of 1514 \n any of these individuals or entities. See Ford v. Harvey, 2021 WL 5964891, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. \n2021) (dismissing claims against defendants who were named in the caption of the complaint where plaintiff “fail[ed ] to allege their personal involvement in any of the alleged violations”) . \nTherefore, I will dismiss the complaint without addressing the additional arguments for \ndismissal that have been raised in the defendants’ motions to dismiss.  See Mendes Da Costa v.  \nMarcucilli , 675 F. App’x 15, 17 (2d Cir. 2017)  (affirming district court’s dismissal of amended \ncomplaint  that was “nearly 50 pages long . . . convoluted and repetitive”  because it was \n“virtually impossible to link the various defendants to [plaintiff’s] alleged injuries” and the \ncomplaint “discuss[ed] non- defendants and other events without explaining how they are \ninvolved with the alleged conspiracy”) ; Prezzi v. Schelter, 469 F.2d 691, 692 (2d Cir. 1972) ( per \ncuriam ) (upholding final dismissal of amended  complaint that was “equally prolix” as the initial \ncomplaint and “for the most part incomprehensible”).  \nC\nONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court  GRANTS the defendants’ motions to dismiss \n(Docs. #255, #257, #258, #260, and #281) with prejudice and DISMISSES with prejudice any remaining claims against any remaining defendants pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) and 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).  \nThe Court has previously allowed an amended complaint, and the Court declines to allow \nanother amended complaint on the ground that any amendment to the complaint would be \nfrivolous or futile.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Yu Lin, a graduate student at the University of Nebraska, who alleged discrimination based on sex under Title IX and Title VII after failing to meet the requirements of her PhD program and being dismissed. Her claims included discriminatory treatment during exams, unequal treatment compared to male students, failure to properly investigate her complaints, and retaliation. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the university on most claims, except for the claims related to her discrimination dismissal from the program and her alleged inability to apply for teaching positions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the University of Nebraska discriminated against Yu Lin on the basis of sex by dismissing her from the PhD program and failing to investigate her complaints, and whether such actions violated Title IX and Title VII.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted summary judgment for the university on the claims related to investigation failure, retaliation, defamation, and negligence. However, the court reserved ruling on the claims of discrimination related to Lin's dismissal from the PhD program and her alleged inability to apply for teaching assistant positions, allowing for further briefing.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Think of a student who feels unfairly treated at school because she wasn’t allowed to redo some tests while others might have had a second chance. She also thought the school didn’t look into her complaints properly and believed she was treated differently because she’s a woman. The school said it was just about her grades, not about her gender. The judge agreed with the school on most points but wanted to look more into her claims about being unfairly kicked out and not being able to work as an assistant anymore.",

Plaintiff has asserted claims for discrimination in education and employment under\nTitle IX of the Education  Amendments  of 1972  and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42\nU.S.C. §§ 2000 et seq and the state law claims of defamation and negligence .  \nThe court  has carefully  reviewed  the pleadings,  the briefs, and the evidentiary\nmaterials filed by the parties and finds as follows.          \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nPlaintiff  Yu Lin has been  enrolled  as a graduate  student  with the defendant\nUniversity  of Nebraska-Lincoln  (University)  since  the fall semester  of the 1998-1999  school\nyear.   Defendant  is a part of the University of Nebraska.  Ms. Lin has completed her most\nrecent  gradu ate course work primarily in the Department of Computer Science and\nEngineering  (CSE).   Students are admitted to the CSE PhD program on a provisional basis\nuntil they pass  qualify ing examinations.  Students are expected to take and pass the\nqualifying  examinations  in not more  than two attempts  over three  seme sters after4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 1 of 15 - Page ID # 8832admission.  The qualifying exams contain three  subject  matter  tracks.   Each track test is\nadministered  by an area committee.   The student’s test papers are graded independently\nby two members  of the area commi ttee.  Thereafter, the area committee converts the\nnumerical scores into a grade of fail, pass, or high pass. \nTo successfully  pass  the exams  and continue  in the PhD program,  students  are\nexpected  to obtain  a minimum  grade  of two passes  on two tracks  and one high pass  on the\nthird track.   The University explains that if a student is unable to meet this standard, they\nare dismissed  from the program  unless  they make  a successful  appeal  to the CSE\nGraduate Committee or the University Graduate Council. \nLin took her first set of CSE qualifying  exams  in the Fall of 2003.   Lin took  tests in\nthree  Tracks,  Theory,  Systems,  and Applications.   During the Systems track examination\nLin requested scratch paper from the proctor and was told there was no scratch paper.\nTen minutes  later a male  student  also requested  scratch  paper  and after this request,  the\nproctor,  Dr. Jun Wang,  left the room  and returned  with scratch  paper  which  he gave  to both\nstudents.   Lin contends that she was only given scratch paper because she put her foot\nout to prevent the proctor from delivering paper to the male student.   \nLin received  the following  results  on her Fall 2003  qualifying  exams:  Theory  Track  -\nPass;  Systems  Track  - Fail; and Applications  Track  - Pass.   On December 4, 2003, Lin\nreceived  a letter  from Dr. Sharad  C. Seth,  Graduate  Committee  Chair,  advising  her of these\nscores  and informing  her that becaus e she did not receive the requisite score of two\npasses  and a high pass  she would  need  to attempt  the qualifying  examinations  one more\ntime and score a pass in the Systems Track examination and at least one high pass. 4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 2 of 15 - Page ID # 8843Lin took her second  set of CSE qualifying  examinations  in the Spring  of 2004.   Lin\ntook tests  in the Systems  Track  and Artificial  Intelligence  Track  and received  the following\nscores:  Systems  Track  - Fail, Applications  Track - High Pass.  In a letter dated April 28,\n2004, Dr. Seth informed Lin that because she had not received  the requisite  two passes\nand a high pass  in two attempts  at the qualifying  examinations  within  three  semester  of her\nprovisional  admission,  he would  recommend  that she be discontinued  from the program.\nThe letter informed  Lin that she had the right to appeal  the decision  in writing  within  one\nweek.   Lin appealed the decision but was informed in a letter dated May 11, 2004 that the\nGraduate  Committee  had decided  to uphold  its earlier  decision  and therefore  she would  no\nlonger  be able to retain  her status  as a graduate student in Computer Science and\nEngineering  starting  in the Summer  of 2004.  Lin states  that in an initial  draft of her letter\nappealing  the decision  she described  the November  19, 2003  incident  where  she was not\nimmediately  given  scratch  paper  as discriminatory,  but removed  this information  from the\nletter  after Dr. Henninger,  a faculty  member  who reviewed  the letter,  advised  her to do so.\nBecause  of Lin’s termination  from the program,  the University  did not grant  her applications\nfor teaching assistant positions for the Summer of 2004 and the Fall of 2004 \nTwo other  male  students  also did not obtain  the requisite  two passes  and one high\npass  after taking  the CSE qualifying  examinations twice in three semesters.  These\nstudents  took examinations  in different  Tracks  than Lin.  Both students were readmitted to\nthe program  after appealing  their dismissal.   One of these students took qualifying\nexaminations  in the area of Engineering.  The university contends that the qualifying\nexam inations for students in the Engineering Ph.D. program contain entirely different\nquestions  then those  found  in the CSE Ph.D. qualifying examinations, and that the4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 3 of 15 - Page ID # 8854Engineering  and CSE qualifying  examinations  are designed  to test a students  knowledge\non different subject matter tracks.  \nA letter  dated  May 24, 2004  from Dr.  Ellen Weissinger, Executive Associate Dean\nof Graduate  Studies,  informed  Lin that due to her dismissal  from the program  the University\nadministratively  dropped  her preregistration  for Fall of 2004  and a block  was placed  on her\nregistrations  beginning  with Summer  of 2004.   This letter also informed Lin that she had the\nright to appeal  the CSE termination  decision to the UNL Graduate Council and that the\nappeal  must  be in writing  within  30 days  following  the receipt  of the letter.   On June 23,\n2004,  Lin field an appeal  of the termination  of her CSE doctoral  program  with the Graduate\nCouncil.   The Graduate Council met on September 9, 2004 and upheld Lin’s appeal.  Lin\nwas informed  that she was provisionally reinstated into the Computer Science doctoral\nprogram  on September  15, 2004  and that the University  would  allow  her to take the CSE\nqualifying examinations one more time before December 15, 2005.  Lin was formally\nreadmitted  to the CSE doctoral  program  on September  29, 2004.   Lin received a High Pass\non the CSE Systems Track qualifying examination during the Spring Semester of 2005.\nAfter  Lin was removed  from the CSE doctoral  program  in May,  she applied  and was\nadmitted  to the PhD program  in educational  studies  on July 7, 2004.   In a letter dated July\n16, 2004  Lin was told that after the Graduate  Council  made  a decision  on Lin’s appeal  in\nSeptember,  that if Lin was readmitted  to the CSE department  she could  be enrolled  in both\nprograms.   However, in the September 15, 2004 letter the Graduate Council informed Lin\nshe could  not actually  attend  both programs  and Lin choose  to resume  her studies  in the\nCSE program. 4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 4 of 15 - Page ID # 8865After  Lin was admitted  to the PhD program  in educational  studies,  Lin was awarded\na research assistant position with the University’s  Libraries  Digital  Initiatives and Special\nCollections  for the period  of February  1, 2005  trough  May 31, 2005.   In a letter dated April\n26, 2005  from Nancy  Busch,  Associate  Dean  of Libraries,  Lin was offered  the opportunity\nto continue  her graduate  assistant  position  with the University’s  Libraries  Digital  initiatives\nand Special  Collections  office.   The letter directed her to sign the letter and return it to Ms.\nBusch  no later than April 29, 2005.   In an Affidavit filed with this court Ms. Busch says she\nnever  received  a signed  copy  of the letter.   Therefore, another letter dated July 8, 2005 was\nsent to Lin offering  her the same  research assistant position beginning August 1, 2005\nthrough  May 31, 2005.   The letter directed Lin to sign and return the later no later than July\n15, 2005  in order  to accept  the research  assistant  position.   She never signed and returned\nthe letter.   Ms. Busch states it was assumed she had declined the position.  Lin states that\nshe signed  the April 26, 2005  letter  and returned  it to Janet  Medcalf,  an employee  with the\nUniver sity’s Libraries, and that is the reason she did not sign the July 8, 2005 letter.  Lin\nattached  a sign copy  of the April 26, 2005  letter  to her complaint  filed with this court.   (Filing\nNo. 18).      \nLin filed her first internal  complaint  with the University’s  Office  of Equity,  Access  and\nDiversity  Programs  on June  28, 2004.   In this complaint Lin claimed that the proctor at the\nSystems track exam  discriminated  against  her based  on her sex by failing to provide her\nwith scratch  paper.   Lin filed a second complaint with this department on October 27, 2004.\nIn this complaint,  Lin claimed  that the CSE department  retaliated  against  her for her by\ndismissing  her from the program  in May 2004.   Lin also filed a charge of discrimination with\nthe United  States  Department  of Education  Office  of Civil Rights  on January  23, 2006  and4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 5 of 15 - Page ID # 8876with the Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission  on March  10, 2005.  The EEOC\ndismissed  the charges  filed with that agency  in a letter  dated  May 31, 2005  concluding  that\nLin was not an employee.    The Office of Equity, Access and Diversity Programs\ninvestigated  Lin’s claims  and determined  that they were  not actionable.   The Office of Civil\nRights  closed  Lin’s file informing  her that she can refile within 60 days following the\ntermination  of these  court  proceedings.   Lin filed her civil complaint with this Court on June\n29, 2005.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nUnder  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, summary  judgment  is appropriate  when,  viewing  the facts\nand inferences  in the light most  favorable  to the nonmovin g party, \"there is no genuine\nissue  as to any material  fact and  . . .  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter\nof law.\"  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 56(c);  Harder  v. ACandS , 179 F.3d 609, 611 (8th Cir. 1999).  \"In\nmaking  this determination, the function of the court is not to weigh evidence and make\ncredibility  determinations,  or to attempt  to determine  the truth of the matter,  but is, rather,\nsolely,  to determine  whether  there  is a genuine  issue  for trial.\"   Anderson  v. Liberty  Lobby,\nInc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50  (1986).   The court must \"look to the substantive law to\ndetermine  whether  an element is  essential  to a case,  and '[o]nly  disputes  over facts  that\nmight  affect  the outcome  of the suit under  the governing  law will properly  preclude  the entry\nof summary  judgment.'\"   Dulany  v. Carnahan , 132 F.3d 1234,  1237  (8th Cir. 1997)  (quoting\nAnderson , 477 U.S. at 248).\nA party seeking summary judgment bears the initial responsibility of  informing  the\ncourt  of the basis  for its motion,  and identifying  those  portions  of \"the pleadings,\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 6 of 15 - Page ID # 8887any,\"  which  it believes  demonstrates  the absence  of a genuine  issue  of material  fact.  See\nTenbarge  v. Ames  Taping  Tool Sys.,  Inc., 128 F.3d 656, 657-58 (8th Cir. 1997).\nAccordingly, a party moving for  summary  judgment  must  \"set forth in the brief in support\nof the motion  for summary  judgment  a separate  statement  of material  facts  as to which  the\nmoving  party  contends  there  is no genui ne issue to be tried and that entitle the movnig\nparty to judgment as a matter of law.\"  NECivR 56.1(a).\nIn the face of a properly supported motion, \"[t]he burden then shifts to the\nnonmoving  party  to 'set forth specific  facts  showing  that there  is a genuine  issue  for trial.'\"\nPrudential  Ins. Co. v. Hinkel , 121 F.3d 364, 366 (8th Cir. 1997),  cert. denied , 522 U.S. 1048\n(1998)  (quoting  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)).   A nonmoving party may not rest upon the mere\nallegations or denials of its pleadings, but  rather, must set forth specific facts, supported\nby affidavits  or other  proper  evidence,  showing  that there  is a genuine  issue  for trial.  See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(e);  Liberty  Mut. Ins. Co. v. FAG Bearings  Corp ., 153 F.3d 919, 922 (8th\nCir. 1998).   In this respect, the nonmoving party \"'must do more than simply show that there\nis some  metaphysical  doubt  as to the material  facts;'  . . .  [i]t must show there is sufficient\nevidence  to support  a jury verdict  in [its] favor.\"   Chism  v. W.R.  Grace  & Co., 158 F.3d 988,\n990 (8th Cir. 1998).   Accordingly, the nonmoving party must \"include in its brief a concise\nresponse to the moving party’s  statement  of material  facts.   The response shall address\neach  numbered  paragraph  in the movant’s statement, and, in the case of any\ndisagreement,  contain  pinpoint  references to affidavits, pleadings, discovery responses,\ndeposition testimony . . . \"  NECivR 56.1(b).  4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 7 of 15 - Page ID # 8891 The Court  is taking  its description  of the plaintiff’s  claims  from the Rule 26 planning\nreport  filed by the parties on October 17, 2005.  (Filing No. 22).  In plaintiff’s Motion for\nSummary  Judgment  (Filing  No. 70) she raises  for the first time a claim  of disparate  impact\nunder  Title VII.  This claim was never raised with the EEOC or any other administrative\nagency  and was not mentioned  in plaintiff’s  complaint  with this court.   This claim cannot be\nraised  for the first time in plaintiff’s  motion  for summary  judgment  and will not be considered\nby the court.   \n8DISCUSSION1\nTITLE IX CLAIMS\nPlaintiff’s first, third, and fourth claims allege discrimination and retaliation in the area\nof education.  \nTitle IX, provides that \"[n]o person ...  shall, on the basis of sex, ... be subjected to\ndiscrimination  under  any education  program  or activity  receiving  Federal  financial\nassistance.\"   20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Title IX thus prohibits gender discrimination against\nstudents  enrolled  in federally  supported  educational  programs  and has been  construed  to\nprovide  an implied  cause  of action  to an aggrieved  individual.  See Murray  v. New York\nUniv. College of Dentistry , 57 F.3d 243, 248 (2d Cir.1995).  Courts have generally\nassessed  Title IX discrimination  claims  under  the same  legal  analysis  as Title VII claims.\nSee id.; see also Roberts  v. Colorado  State  Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 832 (10th\nCir.1993)  (Title  VII is \"the most  appropriate  analogue  when  defining  Title IX's substantive\nstandards\")  (quoting  Mabry  v. State Bd. of Community Colleges , 813 F.2d 311, 316 n. 6\n(10th  Cir.1987)).   Under this familiar three-step inquiry, a plaintiff must first establish a\nprima  facie  case.    A prima facie case of discrimination requires the plaintiff to establish that\nhe or she 1) was excluded  from participation  in , or denied  the benefits  of, or subjected  to\ndiscrimination  in an educational  program;  2) that the program  receives  federal  assistance;4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 8 of 15 - Page ID # 8902  The similarly situated males include Mr.  012 and Mr.  212, these are the students\nwho failed  to satisfy  the exam requirements and were readmitted to the program after a\nsuccessful  appe al of the dismissal.  In her later filings with the court plaintiff begins to\nchallenge  the academic  records  of other  students  but she did not claim  in her initial  filings\nthat these  additional students were similarly situated and the court declines to find they\nwere.   Therefore for purposes of her prima facie case the court is considering the\nreadmittance of Mr. 012 and Mr. 212.   \n9and 3) that the exclusion  form the program  was on the basis of sex.  Seamons v.   Snow ,\n84 F.3d 1226,  1232  (10th  Cir. 1996).   The creation of a prima facie case gives rise to the\npresumption  that the challenged  action  was the result  of unlawful  discrimination.   St. Mary's\nHonor  Ctr. v. Hicks , 509 U.S. 502, 506, (1993).  In order  to rebut  this presumption, the\ndefendant  bears  the burden  of articulating  a facially  nondiscrim inatory reason for the\nadverse  action . See Reeves  v. Sanderson  Plumbing  Products  Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143\n(2000).\n1. Discrimination - Dismissal from CSE Doctoral Program\nPlaintiff’s  first claim alleges that the University discriminated against her by\ndismissing  her from the CSE PhD program after her unsuccessful appeal from her\ndismissal  for failing  to satisfy  the program  exam  requirements.   Specifically, plaintiff claims\nthat she was not readmitted  on appeal  while  two similarly  situated  males  were  readmitted\nafter dismissal for failing to satisfy the exam requirements.2  Defendant argues that it\ndismissed  plaintiff  from the program  because  she did not meet  the testing requirements\nand her academic  performance  did not warrant  readmission  on appeal.   Defendant seeks\nsummary judgment on this issue.  \nFrom  the record  presented  by the parties,  it is the court’s  understanding  that upon\nplaintiff’s  second  appeal  to the Graduate  Council  she was readmitted to the CSE PhD4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 9 of 15 - Page ID # 89110program,  and has taken  the Systems  Track  exam  and received  a high pass  and is currently\nmoving  forward  in the PhD program.  Therefore, it is not clear whether the plaintiff has\nsuffered  any legally  actionable  adverse  action  as a result  of the denial  of her first appeal.\n Plaintiff  was not excluded  from participation  in, or denied the benefits of the CSE PhD\nprogram.    Therefore, the court is taking this issue under advisement and reserving its\nruling  on this issue  to allow  the parties  to provide  the court  with additional  argument  on the\nissue  of adverse  action.   The parties shall brief the issue pursuant to the schedule laid out\nin the Order portion of this Memorandum and Order.   \n2. Discrimination  - Failure to Investigate Complaints\nPlaintiff  claims  that the University  discriminated  against  her by failing  to investigate\nthe complaints  she made  against  the CSE department  and faculty.   Defendant defined this\nas a Title VII issue  and argues  that plaintiff  did not exhaust  her administrative  remedies  with\nthe EEOC.   But a review of plaintiff’s complaints to the University’s Office of Equity, Access\n& Diversity  Programs  reveals  that she complained  of experiencing  discr imination  in her\neducational  program  so the court  will review  this claim  under  Title IX.  Defendant seeks\nsummary judgment on this claim.      \nPlaintiff  has failed  to establish  a prima  facie  case  of discrimination.   The affidavit of\nAlicia  Santos,  Director  of Equal  Employment  and Investigations  in the Office of Equity,\nAccess  & Diversity  Programs  states  that she did indeed  investigate  plaintiff’s  complaint  and\ndetermined  that she had not been  treated  differently  because  of her sex.  Ms. Santos did\nnot respond  to the EEOC  charge  because  she had learned  that the EEOC was going to\nadministratively  dismiss  this charge.   It is within the University’s discretion to determine that\na complaint  is without  merit.   Plaintiff has now challenged this decision by filing this civil4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 10 of 15 - Page ID # 89211case.   Therefore, because the complaint was reviewed and determined to be without merit\nplaintiff  has failed to establish that any discrimination occurred.  The court will grant\nsummary judgment in favor of defendant on this claim.    \n3. Retailitation \nPlaintiff  claims  that defendant  retaliated  against  her for her complaint  that the exam\nproctor  in the Systems  Track  Exam  discriminated  against  her by not providing her with\nscratch  paper.   Defendant alleges that the University did not retaliate against plaintiff and\nthat her allegations  of retailitation  are post-hoc  in nature.   Defendant seeks summary\njudgment on this claim. \n“Retaliation  against  a person because that person has complained of sex\ndiscrimination  is another  form of intentional  sex discrimination  encompassed  by Title IX's\nprivate cause of action. Retaliation is, by definition, an intentional act. It is a form of\n\"discrimination\"  because  the complainant  is being  subjected to differential treatment.”\nJackson  v. Birmingham  Bd. of Educ ., 544 U.S. 167 (2005).   To establish retaliation the\nplaintiff  must  prove  that she engaged  in protected  activity  and that she suffered  an adverse\neducational  action  as a result  of that activity.   Brine v.  University of Iowa , 90 F.3d 271, 273\n(8th Cir. 1996).  \nHere  plaintiff  has failed  to establish  an essential  element  of the retaliation  claim,  that\nshe engaged  in protected  conduct.   Prior to her dismissal from the CSE doctoral program\nplaintiff  did not make  a complaint  of discrimination.   She may have considered making her\ncomplaint  in her letter  of appeal  but she did not.  Therefore, because she did not engage\nin protected activity prior to the University dismissing her from the PhD program she has\nfailed  to establis h a claim of retailitation and summary judgment is granted in favor of4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 11 of 15 - Page ID # 89312defendant.   When plaintiff did make her complaint of discrimination known to the Graduate\nCouncil  in her second  appeal , plaintiff did not suffer an adverse action, rather she was\nreadmitted  to the graduate  program.   Therefore, plaintiff has failed to establish an essential\nelement  of her claim  of Retailitation.   Summary Judgment is granted in favor of the\ndefendant. \nB. TITLE VII\nPlaintiff’s  second  claim  alleges  a violation  of Title VII.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nof 1964,  as amended,  makes  it unlawful for an employer \"to fail or refuse to hire or to\ndischarge  any individual,  or otherwise  to discriminate  against  any individual with  respect\nto his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such\nindividual's  race,  color,  religion , sex, or national origin.\"  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).\nSummary  judgment  may be entered  in a Title VII action \"if any essential element of the\nprima  facie  case  is not supported  by specific  facts sufficient to raise a genuine issue for\ntrial.\"  Brower v. Runyon , 178 F.3d 1002, 1005 (8th Cir. 1999).  \nPrima Facie Case\nA prima  facie  case  of discrimination  requires  the plaintiff  to establish  that he 1) is a\nmember of a protected class; 2) was qualified to perform  her job; 3) suffered  an adverse\nemployment  action;  and 4) was treated differently than similarly situated people. See\nSchof fstall v. Henderson , 223 F.3d 818, 825 (8th Cir. 2000) ( citing Breeding  v. Arthur  J.\nGallagher  & Co., 164 F.3d 1151,  1156  (8th Cir. 1999)).   If a plaintiff establishes a prima\nfacie  case,  then the burden  shifts  to the empl oyer to produce evidence of a legitimate\nnondiscriminatory  reason  for its action.   St. Mary’s Honor Center , 509 U.S. at  509.  If the\nemployer  succeeds  in this burden  of production,  then the burden  shifts  back  to the plaintiff4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 12 of 15 - Page ID # 8943Defendant  also argues  that plaintiff’s  claim  was not timely  because  it was not filed\nwith the EEOC  within  the requisite  300 day.  The court concludes that Plaintiff had 300\ndays from May 24, 2004 to file her EEOC complaint  and therefore  made a timely charge\nwith the EEOC.  \n13to prove  that the employer’s  proffered  reason  was a pretext  for intentional  discrimination.\nReeves,  530 U.S. at 143. The ultimate  burden  of persuasion  remains  with the plaintiff\nthroughout the case.  Id. \n1. Discrimination - Dismissal of Assistant Teaching Position\nPlaintiff claims that defendant discriminated against her by dismissing her application\nfor a teaching  assistantship  for the Summer  of 2004  and Fall of 2004.   Specifically, plaintiff\nclaims  that other  similarly  situated  males  were  readmitted  to the CSE PhD program  after\nfailing  to satisfy  the exam  requirements  and these  males  were  afforded  the opportunity  to\napply  for, and were  in some  instances  awarded,  teaching  assistant  positions.   Defendant\nclaims  that the dismissal  of plaintiff’s  application  was not discriminatory  and was the result\nof her dismissal  from the CSE PhD program which was based on her academic\nperformance.3  Defendant seeks summary judgment on this issue.\nIt is the court’s  understanding  that after her admission  to the doctoral  program  in the\nDepartment  of Education  on July 7, 2004, plaintiff was eligible to apply for teaching\nassistant  positions.  There fore, it is questionable whether plaintiff suffered an adverse\nemployment  action.   The court is taking this issue under advisement and the parties shall\nbrief the issue  of whether  the plaintiff  suffered  an adverse  employment  action  pursuant  to\nthe briefing schedule set forth in the Order portion of this Memorandum and Order.  \nC. State Law Claims4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 13 of 15 - Page ID # 89514Plaintiff’s  remaining  claims  are governed  by  state common law.  Plaintiff claims that\nshe was defamed  by a member  of the Graduate  Studies  department;  that a faculty  member\nwas negligent  in creating  an exam  question  that could  not be answered;  and that\nemploy ees in the University’s  Library  Department  were  negligent  in the handling  of her\nletter  mailed  to the University’s  library  staff.   Defendant seeks summary judgment on these\nclaims.  \nThe State  Tort Claims  Act provides  the proper  remedy  for tort suits against  the state\nand employees  of the state.   Neb.  Rev.  Stat.  § 81-8-229.  The Act provides that no suit\ncan be brought  in district  court  \"unless  the State  Claims  Board  has made  final disposition\nof the claim.\"   Neb.  Rev.  Stat.  § 81-8,213.  Final disposition occurs either when the claims\nboard  decides  the claim  or when  the claim  is withdrawn.  See id.  After  a party  has followed\nthe proper  procedure  to bring  a tort claim  against  the state,  “[s]uits  shall be brought  in the\ndistrict  court  of the county  in which  the act or omission  complained  of occurred  or, if the act\nor omission  occurred  outside  the boundaries  of the State  of Nebraska,  in the district  court\nfor Lancaster  County.”   Neb.  Rev.  Stat. § 81-8,214 Moreover, the Act has exempted\ncertain  claims  from the state’s  waiver  of sovereign  immunity  and therefore  does  not apply\nto “(4) [a]ny  claim  arising  out of assault,  battery,  false  imprisonment,  false  arrest,  malicious\nprosecution,  abuse  of process,  libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with\ncontract rights.”  Neb. Rev.  Sat. § 81-8, 219 (4).  \nTherefore,  here,  plaintiff’s  claim  for defamation  is not cognizable  under  the State’s\nTorts  Claim  Act and is therefore  barred  by sovereign  immunity  under  Nebraska  state  law.\nFurthermore,  plaintiff  has not complied  with the requirements  of the State  Torts  Claim  Act4:05-cv-03153-FG3-PRSE   Doc # 89   Filed: 03/31/06   Page 14 of 15 - Page ID # 89615in bringing  her remaining  two negligence  claims.  Summary  judgment  is granted  in favor\nof the defendant on these claims.    \nIT IS ORDERED:\n1.       Defendant’s motion for Summary Judgment (Filing No. 50) is granted in part\nand denied  in part.  The motion is granted with respect to the following claims: (1) plaintiff’s\nfourth  claim  of discrimination  based  on the University’s  failure  to investigate  her claim;  (2)\nplaintiff’s  third claim  of Retail itation; (3) plaintiff’s fifth claim of defamation; (4) plaintiff’s sixth\nclaim of negligence in  preparation  of the exam question; and (5) plaintiff’s seventh claim\nof negligence in handling her letter of employment.   \n2.        The court is taking under advisement plaintiff’s first claim of discrimination\nunder  Titles  IX based  on her dismissal  from the program,  and plaintiff’s  second  claim  of\ndiscrimination  under  Title VII based  on her inability  to apply  for teaching  assistant  positions.\nThe parties shall file their supplemental briefs by April 21, 2006 and shall have until  May\n5, 2006 to reply to the opposing parties brief.  \n3.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves W.A., a student with a specific learning disability, and his parents who claimed that the Clarksville/Montgomery County School System (CMCSS) failed to provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The court upheld an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) decision that CMCSS did not adequately address W.A.'s reading and writing difficulties, particularly his dyslexia, by focusing on fluency and expression rather than foundational reading skills. The ALJ awarded compensatory dyslexia-specific tutoring, which the court orders must be implemented promptly.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether CMCSS failed to provide W.A. with a FAPE as required by IDEA by not adequately addressing his specific learning needs related to dyslexia.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court affirmed that CMCSS denied W.A. a FAPE by failing to focus on his basic reading skill deficits and ordered 888 hours of compensatory dyslexia-specific education. However, it declined to mandate a specific vendor for the tutoring, as long as the education meets the necessary requirements.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A student named W.A. was not learning how to read because his school was not giving him the right kind of help he needed. Even though they knew he was struggling, his teachers only helped with some parts of reading that weren’t the real problem. The judge decided that the school must now give W.A. a lot of extra special lessons that focus on the parts of reading he struggles with.",

The  IDEA and the Say Dyslexia Act  \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( “IDEA ”), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. , \n“offers federal funds to States in exchange for a commitment: to furnish a ‘ free appropriate public \neducation ’—more concisely known as a FAPE —to all children with certain physic al or intellectual \ndisabilities. ” Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Sch., 137 S. Ct. 743, 748 (2017)  (citing 20 U.S.C. §§ \n1401(3)(A)(i),  1412(a)(1)(A)) . “[T]he IDEA gives the ‘ primary responsibility . . .  for choosing the \neducational method most suitable to the child ’s needs  . . . to state and local educational agencies ”—\ncommonly referred to as “ SEAs ” and “LEAs ”—which work  “in cooperation with the parents or \nguardian of the child.”  Long v. Dawson Springs Indep. Sch. Dist., 197 F. App’ x 427, 433–34 (6th \nCir. 2006)  (quoting Bd. of Ed uc. of Hendrick Hudson Cent . Sch. Dist. v. Rowley , 458 U.S. 176, \n207 (1982) ).  \nThe IDEA defines “ FAPE ” to include “both ‘special education ’ and ‘related services. ’ \n‘Special education ’ is ‘specially designed instruction . . . to meet the unique needs of a child with \na disability ’; ‘related services ’ are the support services ‘ required to assist a child  . . . to benefit \nfrom ’ that instruction. ” Endrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cty. Sch. Dist. RE -1, 580 U.S. 386, \n390 (2017)  (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9) , (26), (29)) . Special education and related services must \nmeet four  general  requirements before they can be said to qualify as  providing a child with  a FAPE. \nSee 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9) . The first three of those requirements are that the education and services \n“must be provided at public expense, must meet the State ’s educational standards, [and] must \napproximate the grade levels used in the State ’s regular education.”  Rowley , 458 U.S. a t 203. The \nfourth requirement —identified by the Supreme Court as the “ centerpiece of the statute’ s education \ndelivery system for disabled children,”  Honig v. Doe , 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988) —is that the child ’s \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 2 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>3 \n education must be “ provided in conformity with t he individualized education program  [‘IEP’]” \nresponsive to that child’s disability and circumstances. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1401(9) (D), 1414(d) . The IEP \nrequirement provides  “the means by which special education and related services are ‘ tailored to \nthe unique needs ’ of [that]  particular child. ” Endrew F. , 580 U.S. at 391 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. \nat 181).  \nThat IEP requirement, with its focus on individualization, recognizes  that what constitutes  \na FAPE may vary from child to child. The other FAPE requir ements, however, leave room for \nanother type of variation—based not solely on the needs of the child at issue , but also on the policy \nbaseline set by the relevant state’s educational system . The Sixth Circuit has held that, because the \nIDEA requires a FAPE to meet state educational standard s, a school district that otherwise  \n“complies with federal law, . . .  may still violate the [ IDEA]  if it fails to satisfy more extensive \nstate protections that may also be in place. ” Doe ex rel.  Doe v. Bd. of Educ. of Tullahoma City \nSch., 9 F.3d 455, 457 (6th Cir. 1993)  (quoting Thomas v. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ., 918 F.2d 618, \n620 (6th Cir. 1990);  citing  David D. v. Dartmouth Sch. Comm., 775 F.2d 411, 417 (1st Cir. 1985) ; \nGeis v. Board of Educ. of Parsippany -Troy Hills , 774 F.2d 575, 581 (3r d Cir. 1985) ). For example, \nTennessee has enacted specific legislation , the Special Education Behavioral Supports Act \n(“SEBSA”), Tenn. Code Ann. § 49 -10-1301 to - 1307, to govern  the use of restraints and isolation \nin the special education setting. Based on the IDEA’s assimilation of state standards, federal  courts \nhave held that a violation of SEBSA can also give rise to a violation of the IDEA. See, e.g., I.L. ex \nrel. Taylor v. Knox Cty. Bd. of Educ.,  257 F. Supp. 3d 946, 964 (E.D. Tenn. 2017) ; accord J.M. ex \nrel. Mata v. Tennessee Dep ’t of Educ ., 358 F. Supp. 3d 736, 744–47 (M.D. Tenn. 2018) . \nIn 2016, the Tenness ee General Assembly enacted, and the Governor signed, a piece of \nlegislation sometimes referred to as the “ Say Dyslexia Act ,” 2016 Tenn. Pub. Laws  ch. 1058 (S.B. \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 3 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>4 \n 2635) , codified, as amended, Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229. The Say Dyslexia Act directs the \nTennessee Department of Education ( “TDOE ”) to “ develop procedures for identifying \ncharacteristics of dyslexia through the universal screening process required by”  the state’ s \npreexisting “Response to Instruction and Intervention ” framework, which is often referred to as \n“RTI2.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(a), (f)(2). “RTI2 is an ‘ academic three- tiered framework ’” \nthat calls on educators  “to intervene when students first start to struggle and to subsequently \naddress deficits in student learning so that students can avoid prolonged academic difficulties.”  \nMatthew B. ex rel. G.F. v. Clarksville Montgomery  Cnty. Sch. Sys., No. 3:22 -CV-00675, 2023 WL \n4633905, at *13 n.18 (M.D. Tenn. July 19, 2023)  (quoting TDOE materials) . The RTI2 framework \nis intended to assist any students in need of intervention, including students receiving a general \neducation who do not have any IDEA -covered disability. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 6-311.  \nThe dyslexia screening required  by the Say Dyslexia Act is  mandatory for all Tennessee \nLEAs. Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(a)(3).  If a student is found, by that process, to have \n“characteristics of dyslexia, ” then the LEA must:  \n(1) Notify the student ’s parent or legal guardian;  \n \n(2) Provide the student ’s parent or legal guardian with information and resource \nmaterial regarding dyslexia;  \n \n(3) Provide the student with appropriate tiered dyslexia -specific intervention \nthrough its RTI2 framework; and  \n \n(4) Monitor the student ’s progress using a tool designed to measure the \neffectiveness of the intervention. \n \nTenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(c). The Act defines “ dyslexia -specific intervention”  as follows:  \n“Dyslexia -specific intervention ” means evidence- based, specialized reading, \nwriting, and spelling instruction tha t is multisensory in nature, equipping students \nto simultaneously use multiple senses, such as vision, hearing, touch, and \nmovement. Dyslexia -specific intervention employs direct instruction of systematic \nand cumulative content, with the sequence beginning with the easiest and most \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 4 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>5 \n basic elements and progress methodically to more difficult material. Each step must \nalso be based on those already learned. Components of dyslexia -specific \nintervention include instruction targeting phonological awareness, sound symbol association, syllable structure, morphology, syntax, and semantics  . . . .  \n \nTenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-229(f)(1).  TDOE’s regulations implementing the Say Dyslexia Act \nrequire individualized, dyslexia -focused learning plans for students identified as dyslexic, but they \nexempt students with IEPs under the IDEA from that requirement. Tenn. Comp. R. & Regs. 0520-\n01-22-.02(f). Neither the Act nor the regulations, however, expressly exempt IDEA -eligible \nstudents from any other aspect of the Say Dyslexia Act’s framework.  \nB. W.A.’ s Education  and IEPs  \n W.A. is a CMCS S student who was in 12th grade for the 2023–2024 school year. \n(Administrative Record ( “A.R. ”), Vol. 1 at 396.2) W.A. and his parents —E.A. and C.A.—moved \nto Clarksville around the time of the 2016–17 school year , when he was in fifth grade . (Id. at 381.)  \nCMCSS, as a school system covered by the IDEA, has an obligation to take appropriate steps to \nidentify students with disabilities pursuant to what is typically referred to as the IDEA ’s “child \nfind” obligation. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(3); Bd. of Educ . of Fayette Cnty., Ky. v. L.M., 478 F.3d \n307, 313 (6th Cir. 2007) . CMCSS ’s initial evaluation of W.A. showed  significant deficits in \nreading and writing, and W.A. was identified as having an IDEA -covered learning disability, \nalthough he was not identified specifically as being dyslexic or potentially so. (A.R., Vol. 1  at \n381.)  \nW.A.’s  2016–17 IEP identifie d his “Primary Disability ” as a “ Specific Learning \nDisability, ” with a “Secondary Disability ” of “Language Impairments. ” (A.R., Vol. 2 at 683.)  The \n \n2 Although each party disagrees with aspects of the ALJ’ s analysis and conclusions in this case, they mostly \naccept the ALJ ’s account of the foundational facts. The court will, therefore, cite the ALJ ’s findi ngs for \nsome background facts. The court ’s conclusions, however, are based on the administrative record as a \nwhole.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 5 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>6 \n IEP set language- related goals for W.A., granted him some accommodations (such as additional \ntime for test taking), and established that he was to receive ninety minutes of speech/language \ntherapy per week with a speech pathologist, as well as a combined s ix hours per week of \ninterventional instruction with a special education resource teacher, consisting of two hours devoted to “ Reading Intervention,”  two hours devoted to “ Writing Intervention,”  and two hours \ndevoted to “ Math Intervention.”  (Id. at 689–96.) At the time that the IEP was formulated, W.A. \nwas capable of writing about 40 words per minute in response to a writing prompt, with an average of 28 words spelled correctly. The average fifth grader, according to the IEP, could write about 51 words per minute, spelling 48 correctly. ( Id. at 686.)  The IEP acknowledged that W.A. faced issues \nnot only with more advanced areas such as “Reading Fluency” and “Written Expression,” but also “Basic Reading Skills.” ( Id. at 684–85.)  \nW.A. ’s subsequent middle school  IEPs were  broadly similar  in terms of the services \nprovided, at least on their face. He continued to exhibit significant language deficits —for example, \ntesting in the 1st percentile of metrics measuring reading fluency and the 10th percentile for written. ( Id. at 70 4–05.) The IEPs ’ identifications of his deficits, however, began to omit any \nacknowledgment of a specific deficit related to basic reading skills, while continuing to note his deficits in fluency and comprehension. ( Id. at 703–10, 723, 726–30, 741, 744–46.)  \n W.A. ’s 2020–21 ninth grade IEP continued the approach of focusing on fluency and \nexpression, rather than foundational skills . (Id. at 776–87.) The special education teacher assigned \nto W.A., however, quickly became what she described, in an email exchange with  a school \npsychologist, as “ very concerned ” about W.A. In one  internal email, the teacher stated bluntly that \n“[t]his kid can’ t read. ” (A.R., Vol. 1 at 387–88, A.R., Vol. 2 at 812.) Over the course of the year, \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 6 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>7 \n W.A. ’s grades varied significantly . W.A. received F grades on multiple assessments, but he also, \nat times, received As, and he ultimately advanced to tenth grade. ( A.R., Vol. 1 at 388.)   \nW.A. ’s 2021–22 tenth grade IEP continued  the same general approach , supplemented with \nthe “transitional”  supports that become available to students as the y approach the point at which \nthey will transition out of the age for secondary schooling. ( A.R., Vol. 2 at 823–33.)  The IEP \ncontinued to f ocus on fluency and expression, rather than basic skills, and included no express \nreference to dyslexia. ( Id. at 823–33.)  \n In the eleventh grade, however, a teacher again developed concerns that W.A. ’s reading \nproblems went beyond the  deficits reflected in the IEP. The teacher , Bethanie Hargett -Slack,  told \nW.A. ’s mother that, in her view, W.A. could not read. The two discussed the possibility of having \ndyslexia screening performed on W.A. W.A.’s mother  identified this conversation as the first time \nshe learned that W.A.’s disabilities might include dyslexia. ( A.R., Vol. 1 at 390; A.R., Vol. 2 at \n434, 582.)   \nW.A. ’s 2022–23 IEP, however, continued to identify W.A. only as having a “ Specific \nLearning Disab ility” with deficits in “ Reading Fluency”  and “Written Expression ” and continued \nthe same general approach to providing accommodations and support. ( Id. at 840, 848–49.)   \n W.A. ’s grades  remained  mixed. One potential reason for that is that, when W.A. performed \ntake- home assignments, he used a system of interrelated technological supports that enabled him \nto bypass the conventional writing process . The administrative law judge (“ ALJ”) who consider ed \nthis case provided an example of how W.A. ’s system worked:  \nW.A. can speak the words of a topic such as “George  Washington”  into a Word \ndocument by using speech to text software. He can then paste that  written word, \n“George Washington,”  into an artificial intelligence bot, such as “ Chat GPT. ” . . . . \nThe artificial intelligence bot can create a paper about the subject matter, here  \nGeorge Washington, that W.A. can highlight and paste back into a Word document. \nW.A. can  then run the Word document through another software program, \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 7 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>8 \n “Grammarly, ” which will create  a demeanor or style (e.g., business, informal paper, \ngraduate level, u ndergraduate level, or  essay). Where words appear as underlined \nfor being contextually inappropriate, W.A. would click and change them per the \nsoftware ’s suggestion, although he would not understand the  changes being made \nby the software, or whether they w ere actually grammatically appropriate.  W.A. \nwill next use read -aloud software to read him the newly fashioned Word document, \nand he  then would change items that he was not satisfied with or that “ didn’ t sound \nright.”  At that point, if Word notes grammatic al errors, W.A. can again click to \nmake automatic changes that  would be inserted by the software. Once the product \nis finished, W.A. cannot read it himself —he  again would listen to the read- aloud \nsoftware.  \n \n(A.R., Vol. 1 at 392.)  Although that full range of tools may not have been available to him while \nat school, his in -school accommodations did include technical supports that similarly permitted \nsome circumvention of the need to actually read in a conventional manner , particularly through \ntechnology capable of “reading” photographed written language aloud to the user . (See, e.g. , A.R., \nVol. 2 at 829.)  \n The IDEA and its implementing regulations grant a child ’s parent “ the right to an \nindependent educational evaluation,”  or “IEE,” “at public expense if the parent disagrees with an \nevaluation obtained by the public agency. ” 34 C.F.R. § 300.502(b)(1); see 20 U.S.C . § 1415(b). \nOn November 13, 2022, W.A.’ s mother made such a request . (A.R. , Vol. 1  at 394; A.R., Vol. 2 at  \n857.)  Two assessments were performed in connection with the request. One of the assessments, \nby school psychologist Dr. Ryann King, focused on whether W.A. exhibited autism and/or \nattention deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( “ADHD” ). Dr. King concluded  that a finding of \nimpairments bas ed on those conditions was supported, but  she did not focus meaningfully on the \npossibility that W.A. might be  dyslexic . (Id. at 857 –64.)  \n The other assessment was performed by school psychologist Rebecca G. Townsend, who \nconcluded that W.A. exhibited dysl exia, dysgraphia, ADHD, and autism . (Id. at 865–80.)  \nTownsend found, among other things, that W.A. was below the 0.1 percentile rank for an array of \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 8 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>9 \n skills related to reading and writing —including, specifically, his “Basic Reading Skills,” such as  \n“Letter -Word Identification,” which were at around a second grade level.  (Id. at 873.) Townsend \nwrote : \n[W.A.]  demonstrates weaknesses in phonological processing that appear to \ninterfere with his reading and writing skills. In addition to using an evidence -based \nintervention to build [W.A. ’s] phonological processing skills, it may also help to \npractice playing wor d games that require rhyming, blending sounds together to \nform a word, removing a sound from a  word to form another word, and saying a \nword one syllable or one sound at a time. In some cases, incorporating letters  \n(orthography) is helpful for supporting and building phonological processing. For \nexample, use letter cards to build a word and then change one or more letters or \nletter combinations to form a different word.  \n \n(Id. at 879.) Townsend, however, did not dispute that W.A. also needed support with regard to \nmore advanced skills, like fluency. Rather, she explained that his fluency instruction should be \ncombined with instruction involving more basic skills:  \nReading teachers are encouraged to focus on developing [W.A. ’s] reading fluency \nand de -emphasize individual word analysis. Teachers can combine fluency \ntechniques such as imitative reading, repeated reading, radio reading, phrase  \nreading, paired reading, and echo reading with basic sight -word recognition, \ndecoding, vocabulary development, and  comprehension lessons. \n \n (Id.) \n In 2023, W.A. began receiving private tutoring from Dr. Sarah McAfee, a dyslexia \nspecialist. Dr. McAfee used the Wilson Reading and Language System with W.A. Dr. McAfee attended a February 2023 meeting of W.A.’ s IEP team, where she recommended that such one-\non-one tutoring be included in the IEP for the coming year. ( A.R., Vol. 1 at 401.)  \nCMCSS ’s proposed 2023–24 twelfth grade  IEP acknowledged his autism diagnosis  and \nhis parents ’ concerns regarding whether W.A. was r eceiving sufficient supports. ( A.R., Vol. 2  at \n888–89.) The IEP’s assessment of W.A.’s impairments, however, continued to focus on fluency \nand expression, rather than on basic skills. ( Id. at 891–92.) The IEP acknowledged that W.A. would \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 9 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>10 \n need language -related interventions to be provided in a special education setting, but it did not call \nfor services to be provided by an outside tutor like Dr. McAfee. ( Id. at 898 –99.)  W.A. ’s parents \nfelt that the proposed IEP was insufficient, and, while they signed it, they noted, in writing, that \nthey were agreeing only to the provision of the listed services “ versus none at all ” and did not \nagree that the IEP “ provides FAPE.” (Id. at 900.)  W.A. indicated agreement with that position. \n(Id.) \nC. Administrative Proceedings  and Evidence of Alleged Flaws in CMCSS ’s Approach  \n“The IDEA  . . . provides for administrative procedures to resolve disputes when the people \ninvolved in the creation of an IEP are not able to agree on its substance. ” Long, 197 F. App’ x at \n432 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)); see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6), (f) –(g), (k).  Those procedures permit \nany affected party  to raise before  an ALJ any dispute “ with respect to any matter relating to the \nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public education to such child.”  20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6)(A).). “ Any party aggrieved by \nthe findings and decision made under ” the administrative complaint process “ shall have the right \nto bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented ” in either state or federal court. 20 \nU.S.C . § 1415(i)(2)(A); see also  S.E. v. Grant Cty. Bd. of Educ., 544 F.3d 633, 642–43 (6th Cir. \n2008). On March 23, 2023, W.A. and his parents filed a Complaint before an ALJ pursuant to \nthose procedures. (A.R., Vol. 1 at 1–15.)  The Complaint asserted causes of action pursuant to the \nIDEA, the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. ( Id. at 12 –13.)   \nThe plaintiffs  alleged that W.A. had been denied a FAPE by CMCSS ’s failure to address \nhis dyslexia, autism, and ADHD. (Id. at 8.)  In addition to their more general concerns regarding \nthe adequacy of the services provided to W.A., W.A. and his parents  faulted CMCSS for failing to \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 10 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>11 \n comply with the Say Dyslexia Act by failing to provide adequate screening for dyslexia, failing to \nprovide W.A. and his parents  with the notice and information required by the Act, and failing to \nperform any “ dyslexia -specific interventions.”  (Id. at 11.)  The parties engaged in discovery, and \nthe plaintiffs ’ challenge was ultimately heard by ALJ Phillip Hilliard  in a three- day due process \nhearing. ( See A.R. Vol. 1 at 1, Vol. 2 at 1–682.)  \nDuring the hearing, the ALJ heard testimony that W.A. was, at that time, on pace to \ngraduate successfully  with a 3.4 GPA. (A.R., Vol. 2 at 200–01.)  W.A. and his parents conceded \nthat that was the case, but argued that W.A. ’s grades did not reflect his progress, because, as his \nmother testified,  those grades had been enabled, at least in part, by his reliance on assistive \ntechnology, including ChatGPT, voice -to-text, and the Grammarly software. ( Id. at 458–60.)  She \nexplained that W.A. was capable of absorbing educational information from ordinary, spoken instruction, but that, if reading or writing was involved, that information recall only translated to good grades based on W.A.’ s “accommodations and workarounds. ” (Id. at 464.) She confirmed \nthat, if called on to write for himself, W.A. was not e ven consistently capable of spelling his \nsurname correctly.\n3 (Id. at 466.)   \nCounsel for W.A. likened W.A.’ s situation to that of a swimmer in a race who advanced \nfrom one side of the pool to the other by dragging himself along the ropes. Such a swimmer, counsel explained, could “ get from point A to point B,”  but would not be “actually swimming. ” \n(Id. at 16.)  In addition to the evidence presented regarding W.A. ’s use of technological assistance \nfor take -home assignments, the evidence at the hearing demonstrated the ways in which W.A.’ s \nin-school accommodations also enabled him to obtain passing grades , despite his reading and \n \n3 This fact is confirmed by W.A.’s signatures, including the signature on his proposed 12th- grade IEP.  \n(See A.R., Vol. 2 at 900.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 11 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>12 \n writing difficulties. For example, W.A. was permitted to use “ Snap&Read ” technology on \nassignments , which converts a photograph of text into artificial speech. ( Id. at 92 . 147, 895.)  \nSome of the evidence presented  to the ALJ casts doubt on the possibility that it is \nnecessarily significant , in and of itself, whether  or not the documentation surrounding a child’ s \nspecial education specifically uses the term “ dyslexia.”  CMCSS Director of Special Populations \nTaylia Griffith  explained that CMCSS favored the use of more generic language because dyslexia \nwas not a recognized “ eligibility category ” under the IDEA. (Id. at 136–37.)  That characterization \nis an accurate statement of the law, in that “‘ [d]yslexia ’ is not a qualifying disability category ,” \nbut, rather, “ one example of various disabilities falling within the eligibility category of Specific \nLearning Disability.”  L.C. on behalf of A.S. v. Issaquah Sch. Dist., No. C17- 1365JLR, 2019 WL \n2023567, at *17 (W.D. Wash. May 8, 2019)  (citing 34 C.F.R. § 300.8(c)(10)(i) ). However, the \nterminology that Griffith  suggested would be appropriate instead of  an express reference to  \ndyslexia —an acknowledgment of deficits in “basic reading skills” —was precisely the term that \nbegan to be omitted from W.A.’s IEPs in favor of a focus on fluency and expression. (A.R., Vol. \n2 at 136.)  \nGriffith ’s testimony, moreover , did not suggest that IDEA’s failure to acknowledge \ndyslexia as a distinct eligibility category negated the possibility that a specific diagnosis of dyslexia might have a meaningful bearing on the appropriateness of interventions in the case of any particu lar student. Griffith , moreover, conceded that, while it is appropriate to use technology \nto assist disabled students, it can be a problem if the technology “mask[s] ” whether the student is \n“able to do the work ” or becomes a “ substitute ” for actually learn ing a necessary skill that the \nstudent is capable of learning. ( Id. at 232–37.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 12 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>13 \n W.A. and his parents called, as an expert, Katheryn Elizabeth Metcalf, who had, until \nrecently, served as the Director of Special Education for the Crockett County School Syste m. (Id. \nat 242–44.) Metcalf testified that she had  been  specifically trained by the State of Tennessee \nregarding the dangers of allowing students with reading difficulties to become overly dependent \non technological supports. ( Id. at 24 5–47.)  \nShe also testified that a focus on more advanced topics of fluency and written expression, \nbefore a child has developed basic reading skills, is ineffective. ( Id. at 253–54.) She testified , \nhowever, that, based on her review, “ all of W.A. ’s evaluations and IEP s have focused on reading \nfluency but never addressed basic foundational reading skills .”4 (Id. at 320.) “Basic reading skills, ” \nMetcalf explained, are the foundational skills , such as those involving phonetics  and the alphabet , \nthat are typically learned in kindergarten through third grade , whereas “ fluency”  focuses on more \ncomplex issues such as tone and conventions. ( Id. at 369–73.) Both areas, Metcalf explained, are \nimportant, but fluency should be learned as a “ next step, ” rather than as an alternative to basic \nreading  skills. ( Id. at 371.)  \nAs a result  of CMCSS ’s failure to focus on W.A. ’s deficits in  basic reading skills , Metcalf \nopined, CMCSS was merely asking W.A. to “ do the same thing over and over ” without ever \n“getting at the ro ot cause”  of his difficulties. ( Id. at 328.) She testified that, in her professional \nopinion, W.A.’ s IEP goals “ were not written to assist him in developing”  the necessary basic skills. \n(Id. at 339.)  She opined that the IEPs were, therefore, not “ instructionally appropriate ” with regard \nto reading. ( Id. at 353.) W.A., in her view, needed intervention “ using dyslexia -specific materials ” \nthat would help him build “ foundational reading skills.”  (Id. at 354.) She explained that, in her \nview, “accommodations are wonderful, but they don’ t replace intervention and instruction to the \n \n4 As the court has noted, this statement is true with regard to  most of  the IEPs at issue in this case, but \nW.A.’s first IEP di d, in fact, acknowledge a deficit in Basic Reading Skills. (A.R., Vol. 2 at 684.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 13 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>14 \n point where we don’ t keep trying.”  (Id. at 367.) Accordingly, IEPs should be written with “ specific \nskill deficits in mind, ” even if some of the effects of those deficits can be mitigated by \naccommodations. ( Id.) \nMetcalf testified that she examined W.A. herself, including by having him perform a \nwriting exercise without technological assistance, and she concluded that his deficits did, in fact, \nreflect a “[l]ack of foundational reading and writing skills,”  rather than simply a lack of fluency. \n(Id. at 337.)  Indeed, she concluded that he “ ha[d] not mastered the basic mechanical skills \nnecessary to produce a written product of more than one sentence that conveys a complete thought or idea. ” (Id. at 338.)  \nW.A. and hi s parents also presented testimony by Dr. McAfee, both as a fact witness , \nregarding her work with W.A., and  as an expert witness based on  her experience and training as a \n“dyslexia specialist reading interventionist.”  (Id. at 388–90.)  Dr. McAfee opined that W.A. was \n“not able to read much of anything that [she] put in front of him ” and needed “systematic decoding \ninstruction,”  meaning instruction that would “ go back to the very basic introduction of the \nalphabet, the alphabetic principle, [and] alphabet sequencing,”  in order to teach W.A. to “ learn \nletters and sounds in order to put them together to make words.”  (Id. at 397 –98.) She testified that \nshe had worked with W.A. about 35 times, over the course of three months, and that she had been able to advance him to Step 2 of the 12- step Wilson Reading and Language System . (Id. at 400–\n01.) She opined that, based on her experience with students  who had exhibited similar deficits, \nW.A. would likely be able to finish all of the steps within three or four years. ( Id. at 401.)  \nDr. McAfee testified that, in her experience, it is not uncommon to meet individuals who \nwere able to obtain formal diplomas without ever learning to read. She explained that, for some schools, “one answer to kids like [W.A.] is to just heavily accommodate  [and]  accommodate, \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 14 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>15 \n add[ing]  more accommodations ” that would permit the student to obtain adequate grades and \ngraduate without having addressed the student ’s language deficits. ( Id. at 414.)  \nCMCSS ’s hearing evidence related to reading focused, in significant  part, on W.A.’ s strong \ngrades.  (E.g., id. at 516 –17, 613.) An assistant principal at W.A. ’s school, Dr. Mandy Frost, \nacknowledged that sometimes students receive improperly inflated grades to enable their \nadvancement or graduation, but she said that W.A. ’s grades did not appear , to her , to reflect su ch \na pattern. ( Id. at 527–28.)  \nHargett -Slack —the teacher  who discussed the possibility of dyslexia with W.A.’s mother \nin eleventh grade —testified to  the importance of classroom -based work to the grades she awarded , \npotentially supporting the inference tha t W.A. ’s full system of technological supports available at \nhome might be unlikely to account for all of his strong grades. ( Id. at 588 –89.) Hargett -Slack , \nhowever, did not dispute that W.A., as his IEPs suggested, had access to some technological supports, particularly Snap&Read, in connection with classroom -based work . (Id. at 591–92.)  \nHargett -Slack further acknowledged that W.A. could have surreptitiously used ChatGTP \nin the classroom as well, given his continuous access to a computer . (Id. at 575–76, 592–93.)  \nHargett -Slack also conceded that, based on W.A. ’s accommodations granting him extra time on \nassignments, she permitted him to take some normally classroom -based work home to complete, \nand she acknowledged that, despite W.A. ’s ultimate passing grade, he received numerous Ds and \nFs on assignments. ( Id. at 593, 604.) Hargett -Slack admitted that she once asked W.A. to read one \nof his own completed assignments, but he could not do so and ultimately conceded that he had not written it himself. ( Id. at 606.)  She did not deny discussing the severity of W.A.’s situation with \nhis mother , although her recollection of the details differed slightly. (Id. at 581–82.)  Another \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 15 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>16 \n teacher, Chelsie Jensen, confirmed that W.A. received accommodations in connection with in-\nschool work. ( Id. at 621.)  \nAnother of W.A. ’s teachers, Lisa Elliott, testified that W.A. earned strong grades in the \nAlgebra II course that she t aught and that, during that course, she observed W.A. successfully \nperform ing in- classroom work. ( Id. at 613–614.)  CMCSS also presented testimony by Dr. King as \nan expert in school psychology. ( Id. at 492, 588–89.) Dr. King took issue with certain \nmethodological aspects of Metcalf ’s report, but she did not opine more broadly regarding W.A.’ s \ndyslexia -related needs. ( Id. at 505–06.)  \nOn July 28, 2023, the ALJ issued a Final Order, holding that the plaintiffs had “met their \nburden of proof to show that CMCSS did not provide W.A. with FAPE because CMCSS violated its obliga tion to provide W.A. with an appropriate individualized education program (IEP) \nreasonably calculated to enable W.A. to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances, which deprived W.A. of an educational  benefit in the areas of  reading and writi ng, from the time \nof the 2017 -2018 IEP through the filing of the due process complaint.”  (A.R., Vol. 1 at 433–34.)  \nThe ALJ included a discussion of the Say Dyslexia Act, particularly with regard to CMCSS ’s \nfailure to provide “dyslexia -specific intervention s,” as discussed in Tenn. Code Ann. § 49- 1-\n229(f)(1). (Id. at 405.) The ALJ, however, also discussed CMCSS ’s alleged failure to address \nW.A. ’s dyslexia more generally . He specifically credited Metcalf ’s testimony in light of her \nrelevant education, experience, and expertise, and he concluded that the substance of her testimony \nwas “almost entirely unrebutted .” (Id. at 407.) The ALJ  noted, in particular,  the high school IEPs ’ \nconsistent failure to identify basic reading skills as a deficit area. ( Id. at 411.)  \nThe ALJ acknowledged W.A.’ s strong grades and expected graduation, but he also noted, \ncorrectly, that the Supreme Court has expressly “ declined to hold that . . . every [disabled]  child \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 16 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>17 \n who is advancing from grade to grade  . . . is aut omatically receiving a [FAPE]. ” Endrew F. , 580 \nU.S. at 402 n.2 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at  203 n.25). He noted that, in contrast with W.A.’s  \ngrades, the actual skill assessments depicted in the IEPs showed “ relative stagnation ” in W.A.’ s \nreading and writing skills , as evidenced by comparing his percentile ranking in assessments, year \nover year . (A.R., Vol. 1 at 413–15.) The ALJ acknowledged that a lack of progress is not, in and \nof itself, evidence of a denial of FAPE. He concluded, however, that Metcalf ’s testimony \nestablished that W.A. ’s deficits could be addressed, at least to some degree, by basic reading skills -\nfocused interventions that w ere never provided. ( Id. at 417.)  \nThe ALJ awarded W.A. “888 hours of compensatory education in the form of 5 sessions \nper week, at 1 hour per session, of Dyslexia tutoring from a reading interventionist trained to \nprovide  Dyslexia tutoring through the Wilson Reading and Language System.”  (Id. at 434.)  The \nALJ also concluded that W.A.’ s claims under the ADA and Section 504 were supported, although \nhe did not award any additional remedies in connection with those claims . The ALJ rejected the § \n1983 claim. ( Id. at 433.)  \nOn August 11, 2023, CMCSS filed a Petition for Reconsideration focused on the nature of \nthe award of compensatory education. CMCSS argued that the “ extent and method”  of dyslexia -\nfocused compensatory education that W.A. receives should be de termined by the IEP team. ( Id. at \n436, 439.) CMCSS expressed a desire, in particular, not to have to rely on the Wilson Reading and \nLanguage system. ( Id. at 438.) On August 22, 2023, the ALJ denied the petition, holding that, \nwhile the IEP team did retain jurisdiction over prospective services provided for the 2023–24 school year, the award of compensatory education was granted by the ALJ in connection with a contested case, leaving it within the power of the ALJ to define the scope of the relief required. (Id. at 453.)  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 17 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>26 \n reflected W.A. ’s work ethic and capacity for information retention, those grades do not establish \nthat he received a FAPE with regard to the specific area of reading and writing skills. Deficits \nalone , of course, do not show the denial of a FAPE —because a FAPE must be judge d “in light of \nthe child ’s circumstances, ” Endrew F. , 580 U.S. at 399, and some children have persistent deficits \nthat a school cannot be, and is not, expected by the IDEA to overcom e. The evidence in the \nadministrative record, however, shows that W.A. is, in fact, likely to be able to improve his reading and writing skills, at least to some degree, through interventions specifically designed for students \nwith dyslexia. Indeed, all of  the available evidence suggests that, for nearly the entirety of W.A.’s \ntime at CMCSS, he was being trea ted like a student whose  ill-defined learning disability \ncompromised his fluency and expression—not as a student who lacked basic reading skills due to  \ndyslexia. The court, accordingly, concludes, as the ALJ did, that CMCSS ’s failure to provide \ninterventions appropriate to W.A.’s disabilities resulted in a denial of FAPE with regard to basic \nreading skills . Although CMCSS undisputedly acknowledged that W .A. had reading and writing \ndeficits in his IEPs and provided some corresponding support, an individualized plan responsive to W.A.’ s specific circumstances would have focused on addressing his lack of foundational \nreading skills, which his IEPs did not.  \nThe court ’s finding, in that regard, is based on the likely efficacy of targeted instruction \nfocused on basic reading skills  for individuals with dyslexia , as compared to the education that \nW.A. actually received . The court, in other words, is not formalis tically relying on  whether W.A. ’s \nIEPs  expressly invoke d “dyslexia ” in describing the services provided. If the ALJ had, in fact, \nrelied solely on whether the support that W.A. received was expressly  designated as “ dyslexia -\nspecific, ” that may well have been error. That, though, is not what the ALJ did, and it is not what \nthe court is doing here . The ALJ considered W.A. ’s specific needs and concluded that a FAPE \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 26 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>27 \n required W.A. to receive certain specific tutoring services that would likely have been more \neffective than the  inadequate support he actually received. This court, based on its review of the \nrecord, reaches the same conclusion. The IDEA guarantees W.A. educational benefits appropriate to his situation —not merely generic support for children who struggle with language and a system \nof accommodations so sweeping that it makes the severity of his disability hard to notice.  \nSimilarly, this court does not base its conclusion on technical noncompliance with the Say \nDyslexia Act. If CMCSS violated all of the  Say Dyslexia Act ’s general requirements, but had \nnevertheless adequately addressed W.A. ’s specific disability -related needs, there would be no \nbasis for an award under the IDEA. Conversely, if CMCSS had made an effort to scrupulously comply with the Say D yslexia Act, but had nevertheless failed to provide necessary services, that \ntechnical compliance would not excuse the underlying IDEA violation. It may well be true that, if \nCMCSS had granted W.A. access to the structure envisioned by the Say Dyslexia Act , that would \nhave prevented a violation of his right to a FAPE. It is, however, that denial of an educational \nbenefit —not the details of how it might have been avoided—that support s an award to the \nplaintiffs.  \nW.A. has established, with evidence, that he likely would have benefited substantially from \none-on-one tutoring geared toward addressing his specific, dyslexia -correlated deficits, rather than \nthe more general support that he received , and that the adequacy of his educational benefit was \nsignificantly degraded by CMCSS ’s failure to provide that manner of services . An individualized \napproach tailored to W.A. ’s specific needs would not simply have provided him general language \nsupports, but would have recogni zed his specific need to focus on basic reading skills , guided by \nan awareness of his dyslexia. The court, accordingly, will uphold the ALJ ’s determination that \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 27 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>28 \n W.A. was denied a FAPE.5 The court, moreover, agrees with the ALJ’s assessment that the \nappropriate remedy for that denial is the provision of 888 hours of dyslexia -specific tutoring. \nD. Method for Providing Compensatory Education  \n The only remaining question, then, is the one that was first raised before this court: whether \nW.A. has a right to have the court further restrict the mechanisms through which his compensatory \ninstruction should be provided. As a preliminary matter, the co urt notes that the ALJ was correct \nthat he had the authority to require the use of the Wilson Reading and Language System , regardless \nof the fact that, if CMCSS had provided dyslexia -specific interventions in the first place, it would \nhave had the discreti on to choose between other alternatives. The IDEA takes a “flexible approach”  \nto remedies, L.M. , 478 F.3d at  316, allowing a court to “ grant such relief as [it] determines is \nappropriate. ” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii). “ An award of compensatory education is an equitable \nremedy that a court can grant as it finds appropriate.”  L.M. , 478 F.3d at 316 (citing 20 U.S.C. § \n1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); Park ex rel. Park v. Anaheim Union High Sch. Dist., 464 F.3d 1025, 1034 (9th \nCir. 2006) ); see, e.g. , Somberg, 908 F.3d at  177; Woods v. Northport Pub. Sch., 487 F. App’ x 968, \n978 (6th Cir. 2012) . The ALJ concluded that, because W.A. had already received numerous \nsessions in connection with the Wilson Reading and Language System  and had advanced within \nthat syste m, continuing along that course would provide the appropriate remedy. The court agrees. \nWhether or not other systems might work adequately in the abstract, W.A. ’s individual situation \nis that (1) these interventions are occurring far later in his education than they should have and (2) he has already done substantial work in the Wilson Reading and Language System. The court holds \n \n5 In addition to the ALJ ’s focus on W.A.’ s general denial of a FAPE, the ALJ found that CMCSS had failed \nto provide W.A. with sufficient transition services, for which the ALJ ordered only very modest relief in \nthe form of providing W.A. with some career -related assessments. (A.R., Vol. 1 at 431.)  CMCSS briefly \naddresses this aspect of the ALJ’s holding in its briefing, but its argument is conclusory and amounts to \nlittle more than saying that the ALJ erred. The court finds no error with regard to this aspect of the ALJ’s \ndetermination.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 28 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>29 \n that the appropriate mechanism for  remedying his denial of a FAPE is continuation of that \napproach.  \n W.A. ’s primary  argument in favor of modifying the relief to require CMCSS to rely on the \nClarksville Center for Dyslexia  is that CMCSS ’s failure to provide W.A. with instruction under \nthe Wilson Reading and Language System  until now should be construed as either a refusal or  an \ninability  to do so. The court, however, finds no basis for drawing so strong an inference. For the \noverwhelming majority of the time that CMCSS failed to provide W.A.  with the manner of \ninstruction he needed, it did so because it appears to have been genuinely unaware of the specific \nnature of his needs. CMCSS has represented to this court that it is “ ready, willing, and able to \nprovide the compensatory education order ed by the Administrative Judge ,” as long as it is able to \nresolve “logistical problems ” surrounding (1) W.A.’ s schedule and (2) access to data regarding his \nprogress with McAfee. (Doc. No. 23 at 1.) This court ’s only remedial power, under the IDEA, is \nto order a remedy adequate to address the denial of W.A. ’s FAPE. The court cannot conclude, at \nthis stage, that instruction provided through W.A.’ s preferred source, the Clarksville Center for \nDyslexia, is the only potentially adequate source of such instructi on. \n W.A. and his parents ask the court to consider two additional pieces of evidence that, they \nargue , establish CMCSS ’s inability to provide instruction in the Wilson Reading and Language \nSystem: an audio recording of a November 2023 IEP meeting showing that CMCSS generally uses \nanother system and evidence  from another student ’s case suggesting that the “ literacy transition”  \nteachers at W.A. ’s school lack ed dyslexia -specific training  in 2020 and that there is some question \nregarding the extent of such training now . Neither of those pieces of evidence, however, suggests \nthat CMCSS is categorically incapable of providing the  necessary instruction through any \nmechanism other than through the Clarksville Center for Dyslexia.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 29 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>30 \n If CMCSS does prove to be wholly incapable of providing Wilson Reading and Language \nSystem  instruction with its own personnel  in a timely  manner , then it w ill, by necessity, have to \nlook to an outside vendor. The court, however, has no basis for requiring it to do so and certainly \nhas no basis for selecting one particular vendor . The court, accordingly, will require the same \ncompensatory education that the A LJ did and will stress that it must be provided expeditiously—\nincluding, if necessary, through an outside party .6 If CMCSS fails to meet that obligation, W.A. \ncan return to this court to seek enforcement of its Order. For now, though, CMCSS ’s obligation i s \nto provide the necessary compensatory education through whatever adequate staffing and funding \nmechanism it chooses.  Because the relief originally ordered by the ALJ will now become relief \nordered by this court, the plaintiffs ’ motion to enforce the ALJ ’s Order will become moot.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs ’ Motion to Enforce Final Order of the \nAdministrative Law Judge (Doc. No. 19) will be denied as moot, the plaintiffs ’ Motion for \nJudgment on the Administrative Record (Doc. No. 25) will be granted as to all issues other than \ntheir requested modification of the remedy, and will, in that respect, be denied, and CMCSS ’s \nMotion for Judgment on the Administrative Record (Doc. No. 22) will be denied.  \nAn appropriate order will enter.  \n        ______________________________ \n        ALETA A. TRAUGER  \n       United States District Judge  \n \n6 The court will, however, omit the requirement that the instruction be provided by a “ reading \ninterventionist, ” because CMCSS has disput ed whether  “Sarah McAfee or anyone associated with the \nClarksville Center for Dyslexia is a reading interventionist within the meaning of Tennessee law. ” (Doc. \nNo. 26 at 2.) Whatever the import of that distinction is with regard to general, prospective com pliance with \nthe Say Dyslexia Act,  there has been no showing that a formal designation as a reading interventionist is \nnecessary for the provision of adequate compensatory education in W.A.’ s case.  The court will also permit \nsome greater flexibility with r egard to scheduling.  \nCase 3:23-cv-00912     Document 27     Filed 05/24/24     Page 30 of 30 PageID #: <pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Matthew Waleyko, a former civilian computer scientist at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, alleged sex discrimination under Title VII after choosing to resign following an investigation into his conduct. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Waleyko’s complaint, concluding that he failed to provide sufficient factual allegations linking his termination to gender discrimination. The case did not directly involve AI, but it referenced an investigation incident involving missing computer code files within a department linked to the Navy's Artificial Intelligence Director, underscoring workplace issues related to technology roles.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Waleyko plausibly alleged that his termination from the Navy was due to sex discrimination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that Waleyko's complaint lacked the necessary factual allegations to support a plausible claim of sex discrimination. His claims were deemed speculative and did not adequately demonstrate that his termination was linked to his gender.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Matthew Waleyko believed he was treated unfairly and was forced to resign from his job because he's a man.

Essentially, the rules for deciding if he was mistreated weren't followed well enough to support his claims legally.",

The Naval Undersea Warfare \nCenter (\"the Warfare Center\" ), a division of the U.S. Navy  focused \non the research and development of submersible weapons systems , \nasked Appellant Matthew Waleyko  to resign at the end of his \ntwo-year term of probationary employment.  After his termination, \nWaleyko sued  the Secretary of the Navy (\"the Navy\") , alleging sex \ndiscrimination under Title  VII.  The district court dismissed \nWaleyko's suit for failure to state a claim, and we affirm.  \nI. \nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a \nclaim, \"[w]e 'draw the facts from the complaint and its \nattachments,' taking the well -pleaded facts as true and construing \nall reasonable inferences in [the plaintiff's] favor.\"  Lawrence \nGen. Hosp.  v. Cont'l Cas. Co. , 90 F.4th 593, 595 (1st Cir. 2024) \n(quoting Lanza v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth. , 953 F.3d 159, 161 (1st \nCir. 2020)).  Accordingly, we draw on the allegations in Waleyko's \ncomplaint  to summarize  the relevant facts below . \nA. \nIn June 2020, Waleyko was hired to work as a civilian \ncomputer  scientist in the Undersea Warfare Platforms and Payloads \nIntegration Department (\"UWDC\") at the Warfare Center facility  in \nNewport, Rhode Island .  There, he was assigned to a project called \n\"Code 4542\" (\"Code 45\").  Waleyko's  employment at the Warfare \nCenter was subject to a two -year probationary period , after which Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 2      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 3 - the Navy did not guarantee his continued employment .  As far as \nhis complaint reveals, the first seventeen  months of Waleyko's  \nprobationary period  were uneventful.  \nIn February or March 2022,  however,  Waleyko's immediate \nsupervisor, Sravanthi Bodana, m et with him to discuss  complaints \nmade by a female coworker, Beibhinn Gallagher , about his behavior \ntowards her .  The complaint alleges that  Bodana told Waleyko that \nGallagher had reported  that \"he sounded condescending ,\" and Bodana \nadvised him \"to be mindful of tone use\" with Gallagher  in the \nfuture.  Waleyko alleges that \"Bodana did not use similar language \nwith female employees.\"  \nIn the same or a subsequent meeting  (his complaint leaves \nthe timing unclear ), Waleyko alleges that Bodana indicated  that \nGallagher \"made numerous accusations against him.\"   Bodana \nallegedly  asked Waleyko about Gallagher's claim  that Waleyko \nforced her to carpool with him on two Warfare Center -related \nbusiness trips in November and December 2021 , noting that an \ninvestigation into the claim was then ongoing .  Waleyko disputed \nGallagher's accounts.  Although maintaining that  \"he was never \ntold what exactly was being alleged against him,\" Waleyko alleges \nthat he \"became aware that Ms. Gallagher had alleged that she felt \nsexually harassed by\" Waleyko, that she had described him as \n\"stalkerish\" because of what the complaint characterizes as \"a Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 3      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 4 - joke about sending [her] a gift,\" and that she had likened him to \nan \"active shooter.\"  \nNotwithstanding his meeting(s) with Bodana , Waleyko \nalleges that he \"was never contacted by an investigator, nor asked \nany questions as to Ms. Gallagher's accusations ,\" and that the \nNavy \"did not investigate the allegations against [him].\"  Waleyko \nalso maintains that  he was \"never provided the opportunity to speak \nor provide evidence during the investigation into Ms. Gallagher's \naccusations.\"   Waleyko adds in his complaint that \"[t]hese sorts \nof allegations were not made against women in [C]ode 45, and \nallegations of this type, when they were made, were always made by \nwomen against men\" and that the Navy \"gave credence to\" Gallagher's \naccusations  \"because he was a male, where as [sic] it did not give \ncredence to similar investigations involving women.\"  \nA second disciplinary episode involving Waleyko  occurred  \nin early April 2022 .  Waleyko alleges that  around th at time another \nfemale coworker, Layn a Nelson, incorrectly reported to the UWDC's \nArtificial Intelligence Director, Captain Jeffrey Anderson, that \nWaleyko had deleted certain of the Warfare Center's code files.  \nIn contradiction of this accusation,  according to Waleyko, another \nsenior-level employee on the same project informed him that, on \nApril 13, the employee  \"found the files and ran the code\" that \nNelson reported missing .  Nevertheless, Waleyko alleges that on \nApril 14, the Digital Engineering Division  Head -- a \"Mr. Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 4      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 5 - McCarthy\" -- and Bodana investigated Nelson's claims and \nquestioned Waleyko about the code files.  Additionally , sometime \nafter Nelson's report, Anderson  allegedly told Christopher \nDelMastro, the Code  45 Department Head,  that \"he had concerns that \n[Waleyko] was an insider threat\" based on Nelson's accusations.  \nAs with the Navy's investigation into Gallagher's \naccusations of misconduct, Waleyko alleges that the Navy unfairly \ndisciplined him based on Nelson's incorrect  report.  Specifically, \nhe asserts in his complaint that \"females would have been asked \nabout where the code was prior to any report being made about \nalleged misconduct\"  and that \"[n]o female was subjected to similar \ninvestigations after it was already proven the conduct being \ninvestigated was not true.\"   Waleyko also contends  that while \nNelson \"remai ns employed and was not disciplined,\" as a male, \n\"[Waleyko]  would have been impacted by negative consequences\" had \nhe lodged a similarly false accusation against another employee.  \nFinally, Waleyko claims that on some other occasion  \"it \nwas alleged that [he] was emotionally unstable\" because he wept in \nhis supervisor's office .  Waleyko alleges that he was \"investigated \nover claims he might be an insider threat\" because of this episode.  \nHe further  maintains  that \"[s]uch an investigation would not have \nbeen done if [he] were a female and crying in his supervisor's \noffice, as [he] knows of numerous women who have cried at work and Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 5      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 6 - were not investigated for being emotionally unstable and an insider \nthreat.\"  \nWaleyko alleges that he was asked to choose between  \nelective resignation or termination , and he opted to resign .  In \nJune 2022, Waleyko received a termination letter signed by \nDelMastro.  Waleyko maintains, however, that his \"termination was \npretextual and the reasons provided on the notice of termination \nwere a pretense for gender discrimination .\"  He alleges that \n\"DelMastro's  [sic] stated to Ms. Bodana that\" Waleyko was \nterminated due to Gallagher's complaints  about his conduct , \nNelson's accusations of code deletion, and \"allegations [that he] \nwas an insider threat .\"  Waleyko adds that, at some other point, \nMcCarthy gave Bodana essentially the same explanation for his \ntermination.  Still, Waleyko contends  that \"[n]o female would have \never been terminated based on these allegations alone\"  and that \nthese complaints against him \"are allegations based on \nstereotypical male -based be havior.\"  \nB. \nFollowing his termination  and after failing to obtain \nrelief through an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor , Waleyko \nfiled a complaint with the Department of the Navy .  The Department \nof Defense's Investigations and Resolutions Directorate conducted \na formal investigation of Waleyko's complaint  and issued  a final \nagency decision in February 2023.  Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 6      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 7 - Waleyko then filed this action  in the District of Rhode \nIsland in May 2023, asserting  one count of sex -based discrimination \nin violation of Title  VII and s eeking monetary damages.  After \ninitial skirmishing and the filing of an amended complaint,  the \ndistrict court granted the Navy's motion to dismiss in February \n2024, concluding that Waleyko  \"failed to specifically describe \ninstances of disparate treatment based on his gender  and thus \nfail[ed] to state a claim\"  of sex discrimination under Title VII.   \nWaleyko v. Del Toro , 719 F.  Supp. 3d 184, 192 (D.R.I. 2024).  \nThis appeal followed.   \nII. \nWe review de novo a district court's dismissal of a \ncomplaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted.   Fantini v. Salem State Coll. , 557 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. \n2009).  \"To survive dismissal, the complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to \nrelief that is plausible on its face.\"  Frese v.

Ct. at 1568 , and once \n \n1 Waleyko variably enumerates the Navy's proffered reasons \nfor his termination, counting two sets of three articulated by \nNavy personnel in his complaint while enumerating  the list at five \nreasons at oral argument .  Neither Waleyko nor the government \nsupplied his termination letter to the district court.  \"Viewing \nthe complaint holistically,\"  García-Catalán v. United States , 734 \nF.3d 100, 103 (1st Cir. 2013),  we read the complaint  to allege \nthat three events collectively spurred his termination: (1)  the \ninvestigation into Waleyko's interpersonal behavior , triggered by \nGallagher's complaints; (2)  the investigation into whether he \ndeleted the Warfare Center's  code files, triggered by Nelson's \nreport; and (3)  Waleyko's crying in a supervisor's office, which \nhe alleges led to him being \"investigated over claims he might be \nan insider threat.\"  Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 9      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 10 - constructively stripped of those speculative allegations as it \nmust be, see Medina-Velázquez , 767 F.3d at 108, Waleyko's complaint \nis devoid of  any assertions  of facts that plausibly indicate  a \ncausal nexus between his sex and termination.   See Frith, 38 F.4th \nat 271.   On appeal, Waleyko advance s three readings of his \ncomplaint that he contends support such an inference , and we \naddress each in turn.  \nA. \nOn appeal, Waleyko primarily ground s his arguments in \nhis complaint's purported comparisons  between his treatment by the \nNavy and how he believes the Navy  would treat similarly situated \nwomen.  Because these comparisons  all either rely on Waleyko's \nunfounded  suppositions  or improperly compare  apples and oranges, \nhowever, t hey supply no basis  to infer the requisite  connection  \nbetween Waleyko's sex and termination.2 \nThroughout his complaint , Waleyko compares the Navy's \nthree investigations and eventual termination of  him with \nunsupported hypotheses of how the Navy \"would\" conceivably  handle \nsimilar accusations of its female employees , but he almost \n \n2 Of course, we do not suggest that such comparator evidence \nis required to survive a motion to dismiss a Title  VII claim.  See \nFrith, 38 F.4th at 274 n.10.  We only hold that, to the extent \nWaleyko relies on the Navy's allegedly disparate  disciplinary \ntreatment of female employees to indicate that his termination was \nmotivated by his  sex, such an inference finds no support in the \nfew non-speculative allegations to that effect in his complaint . Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 10      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 11 - completely foregoes  alleging that the Navy  in fact treated  any of \nits female employees differently .  Instead, the complaint attempts  \nto tether the Navy's  treatment of Waleyko to his sex by asserting , \ninter alia , that \"a proper investigation  [into the sexual \nharassment accusations ] would have been conducted\" were he a \nfemale, that \"an investigation  [into his emotional episode]  would \nnot have been done\" were he a female , that \"females would have \nbeen asked\" about the missing code  files, that \"[n]o female would \nhave ever been terminated based on\" allegations of sexual \nharassment alone , that \"[n]o female would have been terminated\" \nfor suggesting that she carpool with a coworker , and that Navy \npersonnel  \"would never have used [an unwanted offer to carpool]  to \nterminate a female\" (emphasis added) .  In every comparison  but \ntwo, which we address below, Waleyko 's comparisons are entirely \nspeculative and do not assert any  actual d isparate treatment  as \nsuch a comparator analysis requires.  See Ray v. Ropes & Gray LLP , \n799 F.3d 99, 114 (1st Cir. 2015) .  Rather, as his phrasing makes \nclear, Waleyko merely supposes that the  Navy \"would\" treat a woman \ndifferently  in the hypothetical event that one ever landed in the \nsame situation as he did.3  Such prognostications  are precisely \n \n3 In many respects , Waleyko further undermines the \nplausibility of his comparator theory  by affirmatively \nacknowledging among his allegations that some of his comparators \ndo not exist .  For example, in describing the Navy's response to \nGallagher's sexual harassment accusations, Waleyko asserts that \n\"[t]hese sorts of allegations were not made  against women in Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 11      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 12 - the \"conclusory\" kinds of allegation s that remain in the \"realm of \nmere conjecture\"  and accordingly receive no credit in evaluating \na motion to dismiss.  Morales-Cruz, 676 F.3d at 224  (quoting \nTambone, 597 F.3d at 442) ; accord Smith & Wesson , 605 U.S. at  --, \n145 S. Ct. at 1568 . \nHis conjectural suppositions aside, Waleyko does \nmaintain  that Nelson  is a similarly situated employee whose \ndissimilar treatment  by the Navy for her own alleged misconduct  \npermits an inference of bias.   As Waleyko alleges in his complaint, \nNelson was \"not discipline [sic] or terminated for false statements \nas a male would have been\"  after she made the false report about \nWaleyko deleting code files .  He goes on to allege that \"if [he], \na male, had made statements to the U.S. Navy that were proven \nfalse, such as Ms. Nelson alleged against him, he would have been \nimpacted by negative consequences, such as termination or \ndiscipline yet Ms. Nelson remains em ployed and was not \ndisciplined.\"  \nThis comparison  is inapt , however,  as the conduct that \nWaleyko attributes to himself and to Nelson is meaningfully \n \n[C]ode 45, and allegations of this type, when they were made, were \nalways made by women against men\"  (emphasis added).   Similarly, \nwith respect to the missing code files, Waleyko admits  in his \ncomplaint  that Nelson's report was \" not the type of allegation \nwhich was ever made  against females in the department\"  (emphasis \nadded). Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 12      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 13 - distinct.  Nelson, in Waleyko's telling, knowingly lodged a false \naccusation against him , while Waleyko was accused of deleting  the \nWarfare Center's  code files.   Waleyko does not allege that the \nconverse of either is true  -- either that he falsely accused a \ncoworker of misconduct or that Nelson was accused of sabotaging  \nwork product .  Thus, given t he asymmetry of their  respective  \nconduct at issue, it follows that the Navy's reaction to each would \ndiffer, and the fact that Nelson was not \"discipline [d] or \nterminated\" in the same manner as Waleyko has no bearing on whether \ntheir disparate treatment corresponded with  their sex es.  See Diaz \nv. City of Somerville , 59 F.4th 24, 33 (1st Cir. 2023) (\"For a \ncomparison to be apt, 'apples should be compared with apples.' \" \n(quoting Dartmouth Rev.  v. Dartmouth Coll. , 889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st \nCir. 1989)) ). \nAttempting to make a similar showing of disparate \ntreatment with respect to the episode in which  he cried in his \nsupervisor's office , Waleyko also alleges that he \"knows of \nnumerous women who have cried at work and were not investigated \nfor being emotionally unstable and an insider threat\" as he asserts \nthat he was.  But Waleyko's  allusion to \"numerous women\" is fatally \nunspecific, as he does not allege  sufficient details to  plausibly  \ninfer that they were similarly situated to him .  Waleyko's  \nallegation  requires one to speculate whet her these women were even \nemployed at the Warfare Center , much less in the same job function Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 13      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 14 - or under the same probationary status as Waleyko.  His comparison \nis thus too \"vague\" to ground a \"reasonable\" inference that the \nNavy handled his emotional episode differently because he was a \nmale.  Morales-Cruz, 676 F.3d at 224 (quoting Tambone, 597 F.3d at \n442); accord Fantini, 557 F.3d at 26 . \n In his only other attempt to compare the Navy's alleged \ndisparate treatment of male and female employees, Waleyko sets \nforth in his complaint two apparent disparities in aggregate \nemployment outcomes  for men and women at the Warfare Center , noting \nthat eleven out of twelve \"separations from the Command\" from \nJanuary 1, 2021 to July  1, 2022 were by men, and that ten other \nemployees , \"most of whom were males,\"  left \"Project Harbinger\" \nbefore Waleyko.  But these disparities  in departures , even if true, \ndo not support a plausible inference of dis crimination, as Waleyko \nsupplies no base rate against which these aggregated numbers  can \nbe compared.  Cf. Wards Cove Packing Co.  v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, \n650-51 (1989) ( emphasizing  that the  \"proper comparison\" is between \ncomposition of plaintiff's group and a control group in  \ndisparate -treatment claims reliant on statistic al disparities ).  \nIn both cases , these figures say little to nothing  about the role \nof the former employees' sex in their departure  absent comparison \nto the overall gender division  of the \"Command\" and \"Project \nHarbinger,\" respect ively.  Without knowing what share of employees \non either team  were male , we cannot draw a plausible inference as Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 14      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 15 - to whether a given number of departures from those teams was \nsuspiciously dis proportionate  to the makeup of the teams \nthemselves .4  \nB. \nSeparately, Waleyko emphasizes on appeal alleged defects \nin the Navy's investigative processes, essentially arguing by \nanalogy to Menaker v. Hofstra University , 935 F.3d 20 (2d Cir. \n2019), that irregularities in the Navy's procedural handling of \nthe complaints against him were so egregious that the \nirregularities themselves  demonstrate  that his treatment was  \nsex-based.  Menaker's is inapplicable here, however, and in any \nevent, the alleged facts of Waleyko's termination are not \ncomparable to those of Menaker. \nIn Menaker, the defendant university terminated the \nemployment of an eponymous  athletic coach after he was accused of \nsexual harassment by a student -athlete.  935 F.3d at 27 -29.  \nMenaker sued, alleging Title  VII and related state -law claims , and \nthe district court dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).   Id. at \n29.  Reversing the district court, the Second Circuit held  that \n \n4 To be clear, we also do not suggest that Waleyko was \nobligated to present statistical proof of disparate treatment .  \nAmes v. Ohio Dep't  of Youth Servs. , 605 U.S.  --, --, 145 S.  Ct. \n1540, 154 7 (2025).  We merely note that Waleyko's \nstatistically -grounded assertions supply no  alternative  basis on \nwhich to infer a nexus between his sex and termination.  Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 15      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 16 - Menaker had sufficiently ple d a plausible Title VII case by \nalleging facts that \"reflect a clearly irregular investigative and \nadjudicative process\" prior to his termination.   Id. at 34.  In \nparticular, the Second Circuit highlighted  three types of  \nirregularities in Menaker's termination that plausibly showed the \nuniversity's  bias: (1)  the university's failure to interview \nwitnesses supplied by Menaker; (2)  university officials' express \nacknowledgment that the evidence weighed against his termination; \nand (3) university officials' significant deviation from written \nuniversity policies and procedures for adjudicating his \ntermination.  Id. at 34-35.  The Second Circuit concluded  that \nMenaker's termination \"under such circumstances strongly suggests \nthe presence of bias .\"  Id. at 35. \nIn our only case to consider Menaker, however,  we did \nnot adopt it s reasoning as an alternative to the causal nexus \nrequirement , as \"procedural errors are not inevitably a sign of \nsex bias .\"  Doe v. Stonehill Coll ., Inc., 55 F.4th 302, 334 (1st \nCir. 2022).5  Rather, a plaintiff alleging that procedural \nirregularities in a defendant's  investigat ive practices \ndemonstrate its discriminatory animus must still allege how  the \n \n5 While we considered Menaker in the Title  IX context in \nStonehill College , see 55 F.4th at 334, Stonehill 's reasoning \napplies with equal force here, as the relevant standards governing \nsex-based discrimination claims under Title  VII and Title  IX are \nthe same.  Ing v. Tufts Univ. , 81 F.4th 77, 82 (1st Cir. 2023).  Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 16      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 17 - \"proceedings [were] plausibly affected by sex bias\" and are not \nattributable to \"other plausible reasons\" like \"ineptitude, \ninexperience, and sex -neutral pro -complainant bias.\"  Id. (third \nquoting Doe v. Samford Univ. , 29 F.4th 675, 692 (11th Cir. 2022)).  \nThus, Waleyko must not only allege that the Navy's disciplinary \nprocesses were deficient; he must allege  concrete  facts supporting \na plausible inference that said deficiencies were caused by the \nNavy's anti -male bias.   He does not.  \nHere, Waleyko rests much of his argument about the Navy's \nprocedural deficiencies on its continued investigation of the \nWarfare Center's missing code files after they were located.  But \nthe Navy's continued investigation into a report of  missing code \nfiles, even if since resolved  as Waleyko contends and therefore \n\"considered in the light most favorable to\" him, is readily \nsusceptible to several \"obvious alternative explanation[s] .\"  \nFrith, 38 F.4th at 275 ( second quoting Ocasio-Hernández  v. \nFortuño-Burset, 640 F.3d  1, 9 (1st Cir. 2011) ).  For example,  given \nthe obvious sensitivity of its weapons -related work, the Navy  has \na strong  interest in understanding the impetus for Nelson's report  \nthat files related to that work were interfered with , even if they \nwere not , to ensure that such a mistake does not recur .  Gaining \nthat understanding could reasonably require undertaking certain \ninvestigative measures, such as interviewing Waleyko , the subject \nof the false report . Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 17      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 18 - Likewise, with respect to the sexual harassment \ninvestigation , Waleyko's  account is itself internally \ninconsistent, as he both alleges that \"he was never told what \nexactly was being alleged against him\" and was \"never  . . . asked \nany questions as to Gallagher's allegations\" yet also recounts one \nor more meetings with his supervisor about Gallagher's a ccusations  \nin which he \"became aware\" of their substance and was \n\"asked . . . about his past interactions with Ms. Gallagher\" and \n\"if he had forced Ms. Gallagh er to carpool with him.\"   Given his \nown acknowledgment s in the complaint that he participated in an \ninvestigation , Waleyko's allegation that one never took place is \ninherently implausible, much less his assertion that there was no \ninvestigation because of the Navy's  discriminatory animus.  \nMoreover, even if we adopted  without reservation  the per \nse rule that Waleyko purports to glean from  Menaker, the Navy's \ninvestigations here  -- even as Waleyko characterizes them  -- do \nnot share the irregularities that the Second Circuit  said were \nindicative of bias  in Menaker.  First, Waleyko expressly concedes \nthat none of the procedural irregularities he alleges are \"directly \nrelated to a written policy of the Defendant ,\" whereas the \ndefendant university in Menaker had flatly abandoned its \napplicable pol icies.  See 935 F.3d at 36.   Second, while Waleyko  \nnow complains that the Navy's investigation into Gallagher's \naccusations against him w as not exhaustive , he concedes that he Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 18      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 19 - was interviewed  by Navy personnel about both his interactions with \nGallagher and about the missing code files , and he does not allege \nthat the Navy declined to interview other witnesses that he \nrequested.  Rather, he alleges that other witnesses exist who were \nnot interviewed, but not, notably, that the Navy knew of them as \npotential witnesses and declined to do so  as the defendant did in \nMenaker.  See id. at 34.  And third , nowhere in his complaint does \nWaleyko allege that any Navy officials knew that the evidence \ncounseled against his termination  like in Menaker.  See id.  \nWaleyko seemingly attempts  to characterize the Navy as \ndemonstrating the same willful ignorance  by noting that  another \nemployee \"easily found the files and ran the code\" after \"he heard \nabout\" the related accusation  against Waleyko .  But Waleyko does \nnot allege that this employee had any contact with those \nresponsible for investigating the accusation, nor does his \ncomplaint clearly allege that those responsible for his \ntermination knew of that employee's successful location of the \ncode at the time that they interviewed Waleyko .  Thus, Waleyko's \nallegations are distinguishable from those in Menaker, as they do \nnot reveal any affirmative effort by the Navy to impair or \ncontradict its own investigation . \nC. \nFinally,  Waleyko attempts to cast his challenge as a \ngender-stereotyping claim, asserting that all the labels he Case: 24-1310     Document: 00118318547     Page: 19      Date Filed: 07/25/2025      Entry ID: 6738697 \n- 20 - alleges being assigned  by Navy personnel  -- \"sexual harasser, \nstalker, [having] an 'active shooter' vibe,  . . . code stealer, \nand . . . insider threat  within a military environment \" -- are \ntypically associated with  men.  However, \"terms that convey only \ngender-neutral meanings are insufficient to anchor a \ngender-stereotyping claim,\" particularly when \"the supposed \nstereotype of which the plaintiff complains is not one that, by \ncommon knowledge or widely shared perception, is understood to be \nattributable to\" the plaintiff's gender .  Morales-Cruz, 676 F.3d \nat 225.  Here, all the labels that Waleyko references in his \ncomplaint are gender -neutral.  Moreover , we know of no legal \nauthority recognizing  commonly  held stereotypes of men as more \nlikely to \"steal[]\" \"code\" or pose an \"insider threat within a \nmilitary environment\" as Waleyko construes them .  In sum, Waleyko's \ncomplaint critically fails to allege any gender -based stereotype \non which the Navy acted in asking him to resign from his \nprobationary position, foreclosing a gender -stereotyping claim.   \nIII. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Freedom Cheteni filed a lawsuit against Malia Vella and Carrie Lopes, alleging discrimination against him and his business, The VR School, in the distribution of federal funds under the EANS program. Cheteni claims the defendants imposed unfair requirements and terminated services as an act of retaliation and discrimination. The court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing some claims but allowing others to proceed, particularly those involving alleged constitutional violations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Freedom Cheteni has standing to assert claims and whether his allegations sufficiently establish causes of action for constitutional violations and discrimination under Title VI.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court dismissed Cheteni's claims related to contract discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 for lack of standing and dismissed the claim of unconstitutional taking due to statutory provisions. The court also dismissed damages claims against defendants in their individual capacities under Title VI, while allowing other constitutional claims and an Ex parte Young claim under Title VI to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** The court's decision involved a man named Freedom Cheteni, who runs a virtual reality school and claimed he was unfairly discriminated against and his school's funding was cut off by government officials. The court decided that some of his claims made sense and could continue, while others were not valid and were dismissed because he didn't have the right to sue on those specific issues. The court allows Cheteni to keep fighting in court on the claims that suggest his rights were violated.",

Pursuant \nto Civil Local Rule 7 -1(b), the Court determine d that the motion is suitable for resolution without \noral argument, and VACATED the March 21, 2025 hearing.  As detailed  below, the Court GRANTS  \nin part and DENIES  in part defendants’ motion .   \n \nBACKGROUND  \n Plaintiff Freedom Cheteni initially filed a petition in this Court on December 5, 2023 listing \nas plaintiff The VR School (which Mr. Cheteni operates) and the California Department of \nEducation, Malia Vella, and Carrie Lopes as defendants.  Dkt. No. 1.  T he Court dismissed the case \nwithout prejudice when The VR School did not obtain legal representation.  Dkt. No. 9.  Months \nlater, Mr. Cheteni requested that the Court reopen the case .  The Court granted the request on the \ncondition that Mr. Cheteni  clarify  he was pursuing this case as an individual and that The VR School \nwould no longer be a plaintiff.  Dkt. No. 12.

Plaintiff proceeds in this case without legal counsel . \n Plaintiff’s complaint alleges that the defendants discriminated against him and the school he \noperates in the distribution of funds under the federal Emergency Assistance for Non -Public Schools \n(EANS) program.  See, generally , FAC .  The complaint alleges that defendant Vella is a deputy \nsuperintendent at the California Department of Education and defendant Lopes is a program director \noverseeing the EANS program.  Id. ¶¶ 17 -18.  According to the complaint, the department \nreimbursed plaintiff for the purchas e of virtual reality headsets and authorized reimbursement for \nadditional educational services.  Id. ¶¶ 34 -35.  The complaint then alleges that defendants “imposed \nstricter documentation requirements on Plaintiff, including unnecessary statutory audits not required \nof white -operated businesses.”  Id. ¶ 37.  On April 17, 2023, defendant Lopes informed plaintiff that \nthe department suspended his EANS services on the basis of unsatisfactory fiscal documentation, \nwhich plaintiff claims was pretext for unlawful discrimination.  Id. ¶¶ 38 -39.  On May 17, 2023, \nplaintiff filed a formal complaint and, on May 20, 2023, defendants “terminated The VR School’s \nEANS services” allegedly in retaliation.

No. 58.  \n \n1 While the original complaint listed the defendants as being sued in their official capacity, \nthe FAC lists the defendants as being sued in their individual capacity.  Dkt.

Dynamics C4 Sys., Inc. , 637 \nF.3d 1047, 105 4 n.4 (9th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) .  “[U]nder both \nrules, a court must determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint, taken as true, entitle the \nplaintiff to a legal remedy.”  Chavez v. United States , 683 F.3d 1102, 1108 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).  To survive either a Rule 12(b)(6) motion or a Rule 12(c) \nmotion , the plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on  its face.” \nSee Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). This “facial plausibility” standard requires \nthe plaintiff to allege facts that add up to “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). While courts do not require “heightened \nfact pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555, 570.  \nIn deciding whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, the \ncourt must assume that the plaintiff’s allegations are true and must draw all reasonable inferences \nin the plaintiff’s favor. Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987) . However, \nthe court is not required to accept as true “allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted \ndeductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.” In re Gilead Sciences Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d 1049, \n1055 (9th Cir. 2008) (cit ation and internal quotation marks omitted).   \n \n \n2 Moreover, in reviewing the parties’ motion papers, the Court has not considered plaintiff’s \nsupplementary briefs filed after defendants’  reply brief in violation of Local Rule 7 -3(d).    Case 3:23-cv-06286-SI     Document 84     Filed 03/26/25     Page 3 of 11 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  DISCUSSION  \nI. Standing  \n Defendants ’ primary argument is that the injuries alleged in plaintiff’s complaint have been \nsuffered by The VR School, not plaintiff, and therefore plaintiff lacks standing himself.  Under \nNinth Circuit law, a shareholder generally lacks standing to assert an injury to a corporation.  Shell \nPetroleum, N.V. v. Graves , 709 F.2d 593, 595 (9th Cir. 1983) .  But an individual shareholder has \nstanding when  “injured directly and independently of the corporation. ”  Id.  Asserting personal \neconomic injury is insufficient  to establish standing , how ever.  Id.   \n Courts have found allegations of personal emotional distress, humiliation, embarrassment, \nand damage to professional reputation sufficient to allege an individual shareholder or corporate \nofficer’s direct and independent injury.  In Soranno ’s Gasco, Inc. v. Morgan , 874 F.2d 1310, 1313 \n(9th Cir. 1989) , the co -owners of a petroleum company sued county pollution control officers for \ndue process violations and unconstitutional retaliation after their public advocacy.  The co -owners \nbrought the suit individual ly and on behalf of their company, seeking damages for lost profits and \nmental and emotional distress.  Id.  The Court determined the plaintiffs’ argument regarding First \nAmendment retaliation “clearly alleges a direct and independent personal wrong” because the \nviolated rights “belong to Mr. Soranno, not the corporation.”  Id. at 1318 -19.  Further, the Court \nheld the allegation of emotional distress was sufficient to establish individual standing since “the \nsame conduct can result in both corporate and indiv idual injuries.”  Id. at 1319; see also RK \nVentures, Inc. v. City of Seattle , 307 F.3d 1045, 1057 (9th Cir. 2002)  (holding  that principal owners \nand shareholders of corporation had individual standing when seeking damages for intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress and defamation and alleging violations of their individual rights \nunder the First and Fourteenth Amendments ); Frazier v. City of Fresno , No. \n120CV01069DADSAB, 2022 WL 1128991, at *7 (E.D. Cal. Apr. 15, 2022)  (holding that non -profit \norganiza tion officer had individual standing to bring constitutional claims when he alleged \nsustaining general damages, including humiliation, embarrassment, anger, and related emotional \ndistress” ); Brunner v. Cnty. of Yavapai , No. CV -23-08517 -PCT-KML, 2025 WL 588241, at *3 (D. \nAriz.

KeyBank Nat. Ass ’n, 83 \nF. Supp. 3d 972, 988 (D. Or. 2015)  (holding that LLC member had individual standing to seek \ndamages for defamation and harm to her business reputation ). \n Here, when construed liberally, plaintiff’s allegations of individual harm, including “damage \nto his professional reputation,” “emotional distress,” and “a chilling effect on his constitutional \nrights,” are sufficient to confer individual standing for most of his constitutional claims.  FAC ¶¶  15, \n16, 42, 74, 79, 89.  Under the line of case law set forth above, an independent injury to reputation \nor one’s own emotional well -being can serve as the basis for constitutional claims grounded in \nviolations of due process and equal protection.  And lik e the plaintiffs in Soranno ’s, Mr. Cheteni’s \nclaim of First Amendment retaliation relates to his personal rights of free speech.  See 874 F.2d  at \n1318 -19. \n However, as previously established by this Court, see Dkt. No. 58 , the Supreme Court has \nprecluded standing for an individual shareholder or company officer for contract discrimination \nclaims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1981.  Domino’s Pizza, Inc. v. McDonald , 546 U.S. 470, 480 \n(2006) .  Plaintiff’s attempts to distinguish Domino’s fail.  See Dkt. No. 72 (“Opp’n”) at 4.  Like Mr. \nCheteni’s role as the contracting agent for The VR School, the plaintiff in Domino’s  was a sole \nshareholder and president of his company and the individual responsible for making and enforcing \ncontra cts for the company.  546 U.S. at 472, 475.  Since principles of corporate and agency law \nprotected the individual Domino’s  plaintiff from liability under the contract, he could not seek \ndamages individually under 42 U.S.C. § 1981.  The same holds true for plaintiff in this case.  \n Defendants argue that the reasoning in Domino’s  applies across plaintiff’s other \nconstitutional claims for violations of due process and equal protection, retaliation in violation of \nthe First Amendment, and unconstitutional takings.  See, generally , Dkt. No. 71 (“Mot.”).  The \nhistory of the case law in this area provides some support for defendants’ position.  The Supreme \nCourt in Domino’s overturned a short Ninth Circuit opinion that would have allowed the individual \nshareholder to recover under § 1981.  McDonald v. Domino's Pizza, Inc. , 107 F. App ’x 18 (9th Cir. \n2004).  The Ninth Circuit in that case relied on earlier circuit precedent, Gomez v. Alexian Bro thers  Case 3:23-cv-06286-SI     Document 84     Filed 03/26/25     Page 5 of 11 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Hosp ital, 698 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir.  1983) , where the court allowed individual standing in a § 1981 \nsuit when the plaintiff asserted injury including “humiliation and embarrassment.”  The court in \nSoranno  also referred to Gomez when it found individual standing in constitutional claims outside \nof the § 1981 context, so one could argue this reasoning rests on shaky ground.  See Soranno , 874 \nF.2d at 1319.  However, the Supreme Court’s emphasis in Domino’s  on the law of contract may \nlimit its holding to the contr act-based context of § 1981 claims.  As defendants do not highlight and \nthe Court does not find any Ninth Circuit case law that extends the restriction in Domino’s  to other \nconstitutional claims brought under 42 U.S.C. §  1983, the Court declines to extend it here.  \n In summary, plaintiff’s first cause of action for discrimination in contract under § 1981 is \ndismissed for lack of standing, but lack of standing is not a justification for dismissal of plaintiff’s \nother causes of action.  \n \nII. Real Party in Interest  \n Separate from their standing argument, defendants assert that The VR School —not Mr. \nCheteni —is the “real party in interest” to bring this lawsuit.  Mot. at 2.  Defendants correctly note \nthat The VR School was an original plaintiff but then dismissed from the litigation when it did not \nsecure representation by co unsel as required for organizational plaintiffs.  Dkt. No. 73 (“Reply”) at \n2.  Rule 17 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states, “ An action must be prosecuted in the \nname of the real party in interest. ”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a).  “The basic purpose of the rule . . . is to \nprotect a defendant from subsequent similar actions by one not a party to the initial action.”  Pac. \nCoast Agr. Exp. As s’n v. Sunkist Growers, Inc. , 526 F.2d 1196, 1208 (9th Cir. 1975).  \n While the real party in interest and standing are distinct legal concepts, “it is settled that once \na party is found to have standing to raise a constitutional point, that ruling disposes of any real party \nin interest objections as well.”  Apter v. Richardson , 510 F.2d 351, 353 (7th Cir. 1975) (citations \nomitted).3  In Apter , a doctor challenged the denial of a federal health research grant on constitutional \n \n3 One treatise describes the relationship between the concepts of standing and real party in \ninterest this way:  \nIn the realm of public law, when governmental action is attacked on \nthe ground that it violates private rights or some constitutional Case 3:23-cv-06286-SI     Document 84     Filed 03/26/25     Page 6 of 11 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  grounds, but her claims were dismissed by the district court because it determined her medical center \nwas the applicant and real party in interest, even though the doctor had prepared the application.  Id. \nThe appellate court reversed, determining that the doctor had standing and could therefore bring the \nsuit.  Id. at 354.  \n Given that the Court has found that plaintiff here has standing to pursue certain claims, the \nCourt will not dismiss those claims on the basis that plaintiff is not the real party in interest.  \nHowever, the Court recognizes that the underlying purpose of Rule 17 is to prevent defendants from \nfacing recurring litigation.  Since The VR School is not a party to this lawsuit, defendants may \nrightfully fear a separate suit from The VR School should it be able to retain counsel.  In another \nlight, defendants pre sent a question of required joinder under Rule 19.  Under that rule, The VR \nSchool’s joinder would likely be required if feasible, but its inability to return to the Court with legal \ncounsel suggests the joinder is not feasible in this instance.  Therefore , “the court must determine \nwhether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or \nshould be dismissed. ”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b).  Under these circumstances, where plaintiff is both the \nnamed party and the operator o f the missing organizational party, the Court finds it appropriate to \nallow the litigation to proceed, recognizing that any subsequent judgment may have preclusive effect \nover The VR School.   \n \n \nprinciple, the question whether the challenger is a proper party \nplaintiff to assert the claim rarely is analyzed in terms of real -party -\nin-interest or capacity principles. Instead, the courts have tended to \nrely on the judicial doctrine of standing to sue . To the extent that \nstanding in this context is understood to mean that the litigant actually \nmust be injured by the governmental action that the litigant is \nassailing, then it closely resembles the notion of real party in interest \nunder Rule 17(a), inasm uch as both terms are used to designate a \nplaintiff who possesses a sufficient interest in the action to be entitled \nto be heard on the merits. Thus, for example, the well -settled rule that \na party ordinarily does not have standing to raise the constitutio nal \nrights of another person who is not joined in the suit may be thought \nof as merely a particular application of the real -party -in-interest \nprinciple.   \nReal Party in Interest, Capacity, and Standing Compared, 6A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. §  1542 (3d \ned.) (footnotes omitted).  Case 3:23-cv-06286-SI     Document 84     Filed 03/26/25     Page 7 of 11 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  III. Other Arguments Related to Specific Causes of Action  \nA. Unconstitutional Taking  \n In the original complaint, plaintiff alleged that defendants committed an unconstitutional \ntaking of his property without just compensation.  Dkt. No. 1.  The Court dismissed this cause of \naction in its initial screening order since it was not clear that the equipment in question was \nplaintiff’s private property.  Dkt. No. 15 at 7 -8.  In the FAC, plaintiff alleges he had property \ninterests in EANS -funded equi pment and services.  \n Defendants argue that, by statute, EANS -funded services and equipment remain under the \ncontrol of the state and therefore never became plaintiff’s private property.  Mot. at 6 (citing the \nCoronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act of 2020, \n§ 312(d)( 7)).  Specifically, the law states, “ The control of funds for the services or assistance \nprovided to a non -public school under this subsection, and title to materials, equipment, and property \npurchased with such funds, shall be in a public agency, and a public agency shall administer such \nfunds, services, assistance, materials, equipment, and property. ”  CRRSA, Pub. L. No. 116 -260, \n§ 312(d)( 7) 134 Stat. 1928 (2020).  Plaintiff’s opposition concedes this statute “may place title to \ncertain EANS -purchased property with public agencies” but contends that he maintains a protected \nproperty interest in the contractual rights.  Opp’n at 5 -6.4  Plaintiff seems to be merging his due \nprocess claim and his unconstitutional taking claim, but these present distinct questions.  The Court \nholds that the language of CRRSA precludes plaintiff’s cause of action for an unconstitutional taking \nof property,  because it establishes that the property in question was never in private ownership.  \nDefendants do not assert that the language of the CRRSA precludes plaintiff’s due process claim, \nnor does the Court hold as much.   \nIn short, the Court dismisses with prejudice plaintiff’s fourth cause of action alleging an \nunconstitutional taking without just compensation.    \n \n4 In this section of his opposition, plaintiff provides a citation to Westland Water Dist. v. \nNatural Resources , 153 F.3d 1092, 1102 (9th Cir. 1998), but the Court cannot find any evidence \nthat such a case exists.  The Court suspects this citation resulted from the use of an artificial \nintelligence tool.  As the Court has previously warned plaintiff, indiscriminate  use of such tools \nharms plaintiff’s credibility in this action.   See Dkt. No. 68 at 2 n.2.  Case 3:23-cv-06286-SI     Document 84     Filed 03/26/25     Page 8 of 11 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   \nB. Violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  \n Lastly, defendants argue that plaintiff’s Title VI cause of action fails because individual \ndefendants cannot be sued under Title VI, which proscribes discrimination by a federally -funded \n“program or activity.”  Mot. at 7 (citing Ogando v. Natal , No. 23 -CV-02221 -JSC, 2023 WL \n8191089, at *7 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 27, 2023)).  Conceding this point as to individuals sued in their \npersonal capacity, plaintiff maintains that defendants can be sued under Title VI in their official \ncapacities for prospective i njunctive relief per Ex parte Young , citing Miranda B. v.  Kitzhaber , 328 \nF.3d 1181, 1187 -88 (9th Cir. 2003).  Opp’n at 7.  The holding in Miranda B.  allowed Ex parte Young \nsuits for violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, but drew comparisons between \nthat law and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, the law at issue here.  Id. at 1187 -89 (“Moreover, \nbefore the ADA was enacted, other circuits had determined that Ex parte Young  suits were \npermissible for violations of Title VI and Section 504.  [Citation.]” ).  In reply, defendants maintain \nthat Ex parte Young  does not apply because plaintiff (1) has not sued the defendants in their official \ncapacity, (2) has not limited his request for relief to prospective injunctive relief, and (3) has not \nidentified an ongoing federal violation because the EANS program ende d in 2024.  The Court \nconsiders each argument in turn.  \n First, plaintiff has clarified subsequent to the filing of the FAC that he is suing defendants \nin their official and individual capacities.  Dkt. No. 43.  The Court construes the filings of pro se \nplaintiffs liberally.  Boquist v. Courtney , 32 F.4th 764, 774 (9th Cir. 2022).  Courts also may rely on \nthe “ basis of the claims asserted and nature of relief sought ” to determine the capacity in which the \ndefendants are being sued.  Price v. Akaka , 928 F.2d 824, 828 (9th Cir. 1990) (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  Here, since plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief, the Court \nconsiders the suit to be against the defendants in their individual and official capacities.  \n Second, when a suit is against defendants in both capacities, plaintiff may properly seek \ndamages from officials in their individual capacities and prospective injunctive relief from officials \nin their official capacity.  See Cornel v. Hawaii , 37 F.4th 527, 531 (9th Cir. 2022)  (discussing the \nforms of liability for state officials under § 1983 ).  Defendants’ cited authority does not support the Case 3:23-cv-06286-SI     Document 84     Filed 03/26/25     Page 9 of 11 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  proposition that a plaintiff cannot pursue both avenues at the same time.  \nNonetheless, defendants’ third argument that prospective relief is unavailable because the \nEANS program ended last year presents a closer question.  Since EANS funding is no longer \navailable, defendants reason, there is no longer any possible ongoing viola tion of Title VI’s anti -\ndiscrimination provision.  Reply at 5.  The Court is not persuaded, at least at this stage of the \nproceedings.  The specific language in the FAC provides, “Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to enforce \ncompliance with Title VI and co mpensatory damages for the harm suffered and for defendants to be \nenjoined from unlawfully telling payment agents not to reimburse Plaintiff’s vendors for services \nalready provided under EANS without due process of law.”  FAC ¶ 95.  Plaintiff’s theory of r ecovery \nseems to be  that the state’s payment agents would pay  him certain amounts but for the continued \ndirection of defendants.  As a factual matter this may be disputed, but that is not for the Court to \ndecide on this Rule 12(c) motion.  Plaintiff may therefore continue seek an injunction preventing \ndefendants from fu ture unlawful discrimination.  See Jensen v. Brown , No. 23 -2545, 2025 WL \n748139, at *15 (9th Cir. Mar. 10, 2025)  (allowing an Ex parte Young  suit to proceed where the \nplaintiff asked for declaratory judgment an d for an injunction against an alleged retaliatory practice ). \n Consequently, the Court will dismiss any claim for damages against the defendants in their \nindividual capacities under plaintiff’s sixth cause of action, but will not dismiss an Ex parte Young  \nclaim under this count.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \n For the foregoing reasons and for good cause shown, the Court hereby GRANTS in part and \nDENIES in part defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings.  Specifically, p laintiff’s first and \nfourth causes of action are d ismissed in full, as well as any claims against defendants in their \nindividual capacities under plaintiff’s sixth cause of action.  As the Court sees no avenue for curing \nthe identified deficiencies in these counts, they are dismissed with prejudice.  The Court does not \ndismiss plaintiff’s s econd, third, and fifth counts brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of \ndue process, retaliation for exercise of First Amendment rights, and violation of equal protection.  \nThe Court likewise does not dismiss an Ex parte Young  claim under plaintiff’s sixth cause of action.

Padilla , \n542 U.S. 426, 443 (2004) (“[I]n habeas challenges to present physical confinement ... the default rule is that the proper \nrespondent is the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held.”). Thus, Daniel L. Schnurr , the current warden \nof Hutchinson  Correctional Facility, where Petitioner is confined, is the only proper respondent. All other named \nRespondents will be  dismissed from this matter . Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 1 of 122 \n Wadas , 724 F.3d 1312, 1315 (10th Cir. 2013). That being said, h owever, “the court cannot take on \nthe responsibility of serving as the litigant’s attorney in constructing arguments.” Garrett v. Selby \nConnor Maddux & Janer , 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005). And “pro se parties [must] follow the \nsame rules of procedure that gove rn other litigants.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also \nUnited States v. Green , 886 F.3d 1300, 1307 (10th Cir. 2018) (quoting Garrett  for the same rule).  \nSecond, t he first page of Petitioner’s October 18, 2022 submission appears to be a lett er to \nthe Clerk of Court asking that the Clerk “explain to the court” that Petitioner is not a lawyer, that \nthe Clerk “let the Judge know” the purpose  of previously filed documents, and that the Clerk “note \nto Judge” that certain documents were filed in a previous case. (Doc. 1 -1.) Petitioner is advised that \nif he wishes to communicate with the Court regarding cases he has filed, he must do so by way of \nfiling documents under the specific number of the case to which he is referring. Asking the Clerk to \nact as an intermediary between himself and the Court is not appropriate and future requests of this \nnature will not be acted upon.2  \nThird, Petitioner’s October 18, 2022 submission to this Court also includes an application to \nproceed in district court without prepaying fees or costs. (Doc. 1-2, p. 29-30.) Later in the \nsubmission is a Kansas Department of Corrections Inmate Account Statement. (Doc. 1-2, p. 43.) \nPetitioner is advised that, in the future, if he wishes to file a motion in a case, he should ensure that \nit and any documents that support it are filed  with all the relevant pages together. For example, if \nPetitioner wishes to initiate a new habeas action and wishes to apply to proceed in forma pauperis \nin that action, he should  submit the petition, followed by any documents in support of the petition, \nfollowed by a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, followed by the required financial account \ninformation.  \n \n2 The Court assures Petitioner that to the extent this or any of his other submitted documents can be liberally construed \nto show support of the claims or assertions in his petition, the Court has so construed them, inclu ding the documents \ndiscussed below that are captioned for filing in other courts.  Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 2 of 123 \n Relatedly, t he Court notes that  the application  to proceed in district court without prepaying \nfees or costs  is captioned as if it is intended to  be filed in courts other than this one --the caption \nstates “United States District Court for the For[eign] (Intelligence Surveillance) Court District \nColumbi a 2 cases and United States Tenth Circuit 2 cases by E -file Oct -4-20022 [ sic].” (Doc. 1 -2, \np. 29.)  Petitioner’s October 18, 2022 submission also  includes  documents captioned “For[eign] \nSurveillance Intelligence Court United States Tenth Circuit”; what appe ars to be  a motion for \npreliminary orders captioned for filing in “The United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt District [of] Colombia and United States Tenth Circuit Kansas - Colo. District [ sic]”; and a \nmotion to vacate and release from sentence captioned for filing in “KS. United States Tenth Circuit \nand In the Court of Appeals of the State of Kansas [ sic].” (Doc. 1 -2, p. 1 -2, 32, 56.)  \nPetitioner advises that some seemingly irrelevant documents filed in his previous federal \ncases were fi led “to show attempted fil[ing in] Reno [county ],” so it may be that Petitioner has \nsubmitted these documents to show that he has attempted to file them in the courts identified in the \ncaption. (See Doc. 1 -1.) As such and because the motions are not captio ned for filing in this Court, \nthis Court will take no action on the m.3 If Petitioner wishes to proceed in forma pauperis in this \nmatter, he must submit the appropriate motion , which the Court will direct the clerk to provide to \nPetitioner . However, the do cuments now before the Court indicate that Petitioner intends to pay the \n$5.00 statutory filing fee in this matter. The Court will allow Petitioner to and including November \n21, 2022, in which to either pay the $5.00 filing fee or submit a complete motion to proceed in forma \npauperis and the required supporting documentation.  \nFinally, Petitioner’s October 18, 2022 submission to this Court includes  a summons and  a \nnotice, consent, and reference of a civil action to a magistrate judge (Doc. 1 -2, p. 26 -27). This action \n \n3 Petitioner asks this Court for the address of the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Court. The Court refers Petitioner \nto the Rules of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillanc e Court, which are available at  https://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/rules -\nprocedure . Rule 7 addresses “Filing Applications, Certifications, Petitions, Motions, or Other Papers (‘Submissions’).”  Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 3 of 124 \n was filed as a habeas proceeding  under § 2241 , not a civil complaint that requires service of \nsummons. Rather, “[i]n habeas proceedings, a show cause order is issued to respondent if the court \ndetermines a responsive pleading is required.” Brull v. Kansas , 2010 WL 3829580, *1 (D. Kan. Sep. \n22, 2010) (unpublished); see also Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United \nStates District Courts (“If the petition is not dismissed, the judge must order the respondent to file \nan answ er, motion, or other response within a fixed time, or to take any other action the judge may \norder.”). Th us it is not proper to order service of summons in this matter. With respect to the notice, \nconsent, and reference to a magistrate judge, the form Peti tioner has submitted acknowledges that \n“[a] magistrate judge may exercise this authority only if all parties voluntarily consent.” Id. Because \nthe only party identified on the form as consenting to referral is Petitioner, the Court will take no \naction on t his document. With these preliminary matters addressed, the Court turns to its statutor ily \nrequired  screening of the petition in this case.  \nBackground  \nIn May 2003, in Johnson County, Kansas, Petitioner pled guilty to and was convicted of \nkidnapping and att empted rape, which are hereinafter referred to as the Johnson County convictions.  \nSee Online Records of Johnson County, Kansas, Case No. 03CR389. He was sentenced to  a \ncontrolling sentence of 233 months in prison. Id. Petitioner did not appeal the Johnson County \nconvictions or sentences. In June 2005,  a jury in Reno County, Kansas convicted  Petitioner  of \naggravated kidnapping, rape, and aggravated burglary  and Petitioner was sentenced to a controlling \nsentence of 852 mo nths in prison, to be served consecutively to the sentences imposed for the \nJohnson County convictions . See Online Records of Reno County, Kansas, Case No. 2003 -CR-173; \nState v. Strader , 2007 WL 2992402, at *1 (Kan. Ct. App. 2007), rev. denied  April 23, 20 08. The \nReno County convictions and sentences were affirmed on appeal.  \nSince June 2019, Petitioner has filed in this Court several  federal actions seeking federal Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 4 of 125 \n habeas relief from  his state court convictions  under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 . See Strader v. Kansas , Case \nNo. 19 -cv-3137 -SAC ; Strader v. Schroeder , Case No. 20 -cv-3002 -SAC ; Strader v. Kansas , Case \nNo. 21 -cv-3184 -SAC ; Strader v. Kansas , Case No. 21 -cv-3275 -SAC ; Strader v. Cheeks , Case No. \n22-3114 -SAC . In October 2019, the Court ruled that Petitioner’s § 2254 challenges to his Reno \nCounty convictions were time -barred. See Strader v. Kansas , Case No. 19 -cv-3137 -SAC, 2019 WL \n4858308 (D. Kan. Oct. 2, 2019).  In January 2020, the Court explained to Petitioner that he is \nrequired to obtain authorization from the  Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals to proceed  in this Court  \non any subsequent § 2254 petitions seeking relief from the Reno County convictions. See Strader v. \nSchroeder , Case No. 20 -cv-3002 -SAC, Doc. 4.  Undeterred, Petitioner filed a t least one  additional \nunauthorized successive § 2254 petition challenging his Reno County convictions. See Strader v. \nKansas , Case No. 21 -3184 -SAC.  \n Additionally, Petitioner has filed several federal actions seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. § \n1983. Strader v. Werholtz , Case No. 19 -cv-3102 -SAC ; Strader v. Kansas , Case No.  19-cv-3218 -\nHLT ; Strader v. Reno County District Court , Case No. 20 -cv-3001 -SAC ; Strader v. Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals , Case No. 20 -cv-3135 -JWB -ADM ; Strader v. Kelly , Case No. 20 -cv-3187 -SAC ; \nStrader v. Kansas , 20-cv-3298 -EFM -TJJ; Strader v. Kansas , Case No. 21 -cv-3204 -SAC ; Strader \nv. Kansas , Case No. 22 -cv-3054 -SAC ; Strader v. Cheeks, et al. , Case No. 22 -cv-3124 -SAC . In July \n2020, the Court advised Petitioner that he “is subject to the ‘three -strikes’ pr ovision under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915(g)” because “Court records fully establish that [he] ‘has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while \nincarcerated . . . , brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on \nthe grounds that it is friv olous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be \ngranted.’” Strader v. Kelly , Case NO. 20 -cv-3187 -SAC, Doc. 4, p. 1. Thus, although Petitioner may \nproceed with claims brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, he may do so only if (1) his complain t \nestablishes a threat of imminent danger of serious physical injury or (2) he prepays the full statutory Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 5 of 126 \n filing fee. Id. at 1-2.  \nFinally, Petitioner has sought relief through cases that improperly attempted to raise claims \ninvolving 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and claims involving 28 U.S.C. § 2254  in one proceeding . For example, \non November 29, 2021, Petitioner filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Georgia,. See Strader v. Kansas , Case No. 21 -cv-3275 -SAC, Doc. 5 (D. Kan.). The \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia t ransferred the matter to this Court, \nwhich conducted an initial screening of the complaint filed therein ; the complaint appeared to \nidentify claims arising under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 —challenging both the Reno County convictions and \nthe Johnson County convictio ns—and claims properly brought under § 1983. This Court  dismissed  \nthe habeas challenges to the Reno County convictions as unauthorized successive § 2254 claims  and \ninformed Petitioner that if he intended to bring a habeas challenge to his Johnson County \nconvictions, he must do so in habeas and on court -approved forms. Finally, the Court reminded \nPetitioner that because of the three -strikes provision, Petitioner was required to pay the § 1983 filing \nfee in full before his § 1983 claims could proceed. Id. On December 21, 2021, the Court granted \nPetitioner’s motion to dismiss the matter without prejudice. Id. at Doc. 14. The following year, \nhowever, Petitioner filed what he characterized as “a combined file” that raised claims under § 2254 \nin addition to claims  under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988. See Strader v. Cheeks , Case No. 22 -3114 -\nSAC.  \nThe Current Petition  \nOn October 18, 2022, Petitioner filed the petition currently before the court, which seeks \nrelief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241  on seven assert ed grounds for rel ief. Liberally construing  Ground \nOne, Petitioner asserts that his convictions were unlawful because the state suppressed evidence of \nhis innocence, namely that DNA found at the crime scene did not match his own , fingerprints found \nat the scene matched another suspect, and , in 2019, a Missouri state court recalled a 2003 arrest Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 6 of 127 \n warrant for Petitioner . (Doc. 1, p. 6 ; Doc. 1 -2, p. 6 -7.) Liberally construing Ground Two, Petitioner \nasserts that by failing to grant his motions to appoint counsel to as sist him after he suffered a brain \ninjury while in state custody, the District Court of Reno County, Kansas violated Petitioner’s Sixth \nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel. (Doc. 1, p. 6 ; Doc. 1 -2, p. 13 -25.)  \nLiberally construing  Ground Thr ee, Petitioner asserts that his  fundamental right to be present \nfor all stages of the criminal proceedings against him  was violated when he was not present for \ncertain appellate proceedings, for proceedings in his K.S.A. 60 -1507 action in state court, and for \nproceedings in federal cases numbered 19 -cv-3137 -SAC and 19 -cv-3102 -SAC. (Doc. 1, p. 6.) \nPetitioner also identifies in Ground Three an individual he asserts was arrested for the crimes of \nwhich Petitioner was ultimately convicted. Id. As Ground Four, P etitioner alleges the violation of \nseveral Kansas state statutes that he asserts provide a constitutional right to be free “in Bodily \nmovement” and “Free From Experimental Surveillance - - Experimental Drugs. Free from Attack \nand Right to Bodily Privacy.” Id. at 7. Liberally construing the supporting facts set forth for Ground \nFour, Petitioner asserts that the State is forcing inmates under threat of punishment to sign contracts \nagreeing to permit the use of artificial intelligence, or “smart dust technolog y,” that Petitioner \nbelieves results in physical injury or death. Id.  \nAs Ground Five, Petitioner alleges that a family member of the individual originally \nsuspected of Petitioner’s crimes of conviction works with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and a \npolice department and that other family members work at Kansas correctional facilities. Id. at 8. \nPetitioner asserts that these family members have committed illegal acts in his previous habeas cases \nand disciplinary proceedings, violating Petitioner’s cons titutional due process rights and other \nfundamental constitutional rights. Id. Liberally construing Ground Six, Petitioner argues that his \ntrial judge should not have been allowed to preside over his trial because that judge was later \n“removed from the ben ch for [accept]ance of bribes.” Id. at 8. He asserts that the judge imposed an Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 7 of 128 \n illegal sentence, broke court rules, and did not “finish signing off on [the] Journal Entry,” all of \nwhich violated Petitioner’s “Fundamental Right.” Id.  \nIn Ground Seven, Petitioner returns his focus to the individual allegedly initially suspected \nof the crimes for which Petitioner was convicted and asserts that this individual manufactured false \nevidence in the criminal case against Petitioner and in disci plinary reports about Petitioner between \n2017 and 2019. Id. He also alleges that the individual stole property. Id. In further support, Petitioner \nrefers the Court generally to documents filed in previous federal habeas actions he has pursued. Id.  \nAs reli ef, Petitioner asks this Court to release him, vacate all of his state convictions, pardon \nhim or grant him clemency, award him a “civil settlement and damages,” provide him with a new \nidentity, and bar any further prosecution “on facts and charges.” Id. at 7.  \nAnalysis  \nRule 4 of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases requires the Court to review a habeas petition \nupon filing and to dismiss it “[i ]f it plainly appears from the petition and any attached exhibits that \nthe petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court.” Rules Governing § 2254 Cases, Rule 4, \n28 U.S.C.A. foll. § 2254. Rule 1(b) authorizes district courts to apply the Rules to habeas petitions \nnot brought under § 2254, such as those brought under § 2241. As noted above, because Petitioner \nis proceeding pro se, the Court liberally construes the pleading, but it may not act as Petitioner’s \nadvocate. See James , 724 F.3d at 1315.  “[T]he court cannot take on the responsibility of serving as \nthe litigant’s attorney in constructing arguments,” Garrett , 425 F.3d at 840, and it “‘may not rewrite \na petition to include claims that were never presented,’” Childers v. Crow , 1 F.4th 792, 79 8 (10th \nCir. 2021) (citation omitted).  The Court has conducted the Rule 4  review of the petition and attached \nexhibits and finds that this matter is subject to dismissal in its entirety for the reasons set forth below.  \nThe petition fails to  assert grounds upon which relief may be granted under 28 U.S.C. § \n2241. Petitioner asse rts that the challenges to conditions of confinement and his assertions of abuse Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 8 of 129 \n while in custody that are contained in this petition may be raised under § 2241. (Doc. 1 -1.) He \nprovides no legal authority for this assertion, and the relevant case law estab lishes otherwise . As the \nCourt has previously explained to Petitioner, a petition seeking relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 “[is] \nused to attack the execution of a sentence . . . .” Sandusky v. Goetz , 944 F.3d 1240, 1246 (10th Cir. \n2019); see also Mayes v. Dow ling, 780 Fed. Appx. 599, 601 (10th Cir. 2019) (unpublished) (“In this \ncircuit, a state prisoner may challenge the execution  of his state sentence via a § 2241 petition.”). In \nother words, a petition properly brought under § 2241 challenges “the fact or du ration of a prisoner’s \nconfinement and seeks the remedy of immediate release or a shortened period of confinement.” \nMcIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm’n , 115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir. 1997).  \nClaims more properly brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2254  \nIn Grounds One, Two, Three, Six and Seven, Petitioner asserts constitutional violations or \ninfirmities in the proceedings related to his state criminal convictions. The Court reminds Petitioner \nthat the appropriate avenue for a person in  state custody to as sert in federal court that he “is in \ncustody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States” is 28 U.S.C. § \n2254 (a). Any § 2254 claims related to Petitioner’s Reno County convictions4, however, constitute \nunauthorized successive  application s for relief that this Court must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, \nas it has previously done. See Strader v. Cheeks , Case No. 22 -3114 -SAC , Doc. 11, p. 8-9. As \npreviously explained to Petitioner, a transfer to the Tenth Circuit for possible aut horization does not \nappear warranted here, as Petitioner’s § 2254 challenges to his Reno County convictions are likely \ntime-barred5, as his 2019 § 2254 challenges to his Reno County convictions were.  \n \n4 Petitioner’s current filings indicate to the Court that the case now before the Court is limited to challenging Petitioner’s \nReno County convictions. (Doc. 1 -1.) But to the extent that the petition could be liberally construed as challenging the \nconstituti onality of Petitioner’s Johnson County convictions, the Court notes that, as it has previously pointed out to \nPetitioner , such challenges appear time -barred. Moreover, the Court notes that Petitioner has a currently pending § 2254 \npetition before this Cou rt under Case No. 22 -3229 -JWL -JPO that challenges his Johnson County convictions.  \n5 Liberally construing the petition, Petitioner argues briefly that Ground Six, which relates to the judge who presided \nover his Reno County criminal trial, is based upon ne wly discovered evidence, which could be used to argue that the Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 9 of 1210 \n Claims more properly brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983  \nMoreover, the argum ents in Ground Four  are a challenge to asserted conditions of \nconfinement, which must be brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. See Abdulhaseeb v. Ward , 173 \nF.Appx. 658, 660 (10th Cir. 2006) (unpublished) (“[C]ounts relate[d] to the conditions of [the \npetitioner’s] confinement, rather than the fact or length of his confinement, . . . are improperly \nbrought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and should be brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.”). Section  \n1983 , not the federal habeas statutes, provides the ave nue for an inmate to challenge conditions of \nconfinement. See Nelson v. Campbell , 541 U.S. 637, 643 (2004) (“[C]onstitutional claims that \nmerely challenge the conditions of a prisoner’s confinement, whether the inmate seeks monetary or \ninjunctive relief, f all outside of that [habeas corpus] core and may be brought pursuant to § 1983 in \nthe first instance.”).  \nRemaining claims  \nLiberally construing Petitioner’s remaining asserted grounds for relief , which are included \nin Grounds Five and Seven , they assert that various individuals “violated Law” in Petitioner’s prior \nhabeas proceedings and “Disciplinary Reports.” (Doc. 1, p. 8.) The most specific allegation appears \nto be that Jeremy Mitchelle “manufactured evidence” in the criminal case and in discipl inary reports \nmade  in 2017 through 2019. Id.  \nPetitions under § 2241 may be used to attack certain prison disciplinary proceedings, \nincluding those that result in the deprivation of good -time credits, or to assert that a state prisoner \nwas denied constitutionally required due process in the dis ciplinary proceedings. See Abdulhaseeb , \n173 F. Appx. at 659 n.1 (citing McIntosh , 115 F.3d at 811, and Brown v. Smith , 828 F.2d 1493, 1495 \n \nclaims in Ground Six are not untimely. Specifically, Ground Six points out that before Petitioner’s trial in Reno County, \nthe state court judge was removed from the bench for ethical violations . (Doc. 1, p. 8.) The state court opinion to which \nPetitioner directs the Court’s attention, however, was issued in 1981. See id. ; State ex rel. Commission on Judicial \nQualifications v. Rome , 229 Kan. 195 (1981). Petitioner has made no argument that he cou ld not, through the exercise \nof due diligence, have discovered the facts underlying Ground Six long ago.  Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 10 of 1211 \n (10th Cir. 1987)). Howeve r, to the extent that Petitioner challenges disciplinary proceedings, he fails \nto sufficiently identify the actions on which he bases his challenge. Petitioner has not identified \nspecific disciplinary reports as containing manufactured evidence, he has not  identified the \nmanufactured evidence, he has not explained how Mr. Mitchelle inserted the manufactured evidence \ninto the disciplinary reports, he has not explained the result of the faulty disciplinary reports, and he \nhas not shown that he exhausted avail able state -court remedies related to his claims of manufactured \nevidence. See Knox v. Sharp , 818 F. Appx. 817, 818 (10th Cir. 2020) (unpublished) (“ Although ‘no \nstatutory exhaustion requirement applies to petitions filed pursuant to  § 2241, it is well -settled that \nclaims raised in  § 2241 petitions must be exhausted before a federal court will hear them. ’ [Citation \nomitted.] ”). \nConclusion  \nFor the reasons set forth above, the petition currently before the Court appears to be  subject \nto dismissal in its entire ty for failure to state a claim on which federal habeas relief may be granted \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Therefore, the Court will direct Petitioner to show cause why this matter \nshould not be dismissed in its entirety for these reasons.  In the alternative, P etitioner may submit a \ncomplete and proper amended petition that states only claim s that are actionable under § 2241. If \nPetitioner submits an amended petition, it must be on court -approved forms and must be complete \nin and of itself; it may not refer back to an earlier version of the petition or attempt to incorporate \nby reference other filings with this Court. Any grounds for relief not included in the amended \npetition will not be considered before the Court. Petitioner must include the case number of  this \naction (22 -3264) on the first page of the amended petition.  He is again cautioned to attach to the \namended petition only documents relevant to the claims raised in that particular pleading.   \nIf Petitioner submits an amended petition on the appropriat e form, the Court will proceed \nwith an initial review of the amended petition as required by Rule 4 of the Rules Governing Section Case 5:22-cv-03264-JWL-JPO   Document 2   Filed 10/20/22   Page 11 of 1212 \n 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts.  If he fails to timely file a response to this order or \nan amended petition , this matter will be dismissed without further prior notice to Petitioner.  In \naddition, Petitioner is directed to pay the statutory filing fee of $5.00 or submit a complete and \nproper motion to proceed in forma pauperis on or before November 21, 2022. If he  fails to either \npay the fee or file the motion on or before that date, this matter will be dismissed without further \nprior notice to Petitioner.  \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the State of Kansas, Rick Freeman, Jeff Zmuda, \nJeremy Robert Mitchelle, Jeffery Robert Mitchelle, and the Unknown Agents  are dismissed as \nrespondents in this matter. Daniel L. Schnurr  is the sole proper Respondent in this matter.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioner is granted until and including November 21, \n2022, in which to either pay the statutory $5.00 filing fee or submit a motion to proceed in forma \npauperis and the required supporting documentation. The clerk is directed to mail the appropriate \nform and instructions to Petitioner.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioner is granted until and including November 21, \n2022, in which to show cause, in writing why this matter should not be dismissed for the reasons \nstated herein  or, in the alternative, to fi le a complete and proper amended petition . If Petitioner fails \nto timely file a response to this order  or an amended petition , this matter will be dismissed without \nfurther prior notice to Petitioner.  The Clerk is directed to send a § 2241 form petition to  Petitioner.  \n \n IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n DATED:  This  20th day of October , 2022, at Kansas City , Kansas.  \n      S/ John W.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Plaintiff Michael Alan Bonazza filed a lawsuit against MUFG Bank for employment discrimination, but his conduct during the litigation process included abusive and harassing communication, both towards the court and the defendant. A protective order was granted to restrict Plaintiff's communications, demanding adherence to procedural rules and emphasizing the potential consequences of continued misconduct. Although AI or automation is not directly involved in the facts or claims of the case, Plaintiff mentioned Microsoft desktop automation technology in some of his filings, indicating that he might have contributed this information to the case's context.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Plaintiff’s repetitive and abusive litigation tactics justify the issuance of a protective order and potential case dismissal due to his failure to comply with court rules and orders.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the Defendant's motion for a protective order to prevent further harassment. However, instead of dismissing the case outright, the court gave the Plaintiff one final opportunity to comply with the procedural rules, emphasizing that further misconduct would lead to the dismissal of the case with prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone is playing a game, but instead of following the rules, they keep causing trouble and bothering other players and the referee. The referee (in this case, the judge) gives them one last chance to play by the rules or else they will be kicked out of the game (the lawsuit will be dismissed). The referee even wrote special rules for communicating with others and warned them that if they don't start playing nicely, they'll be out for good.",

In this order the C ourt se ts a deadline \nfor all parties to file summary judgment motion that comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .  \nII. BACKGROUND \nPlaintiff initiated this employment discrimination case in the District of Hawaii (“Hawaii \nCourt”) on February 23, 2023 and sought leave to proceed in forma pauperis under 28 U.S.C. § \n1915.  The Hawaii Court granted the motion but concluded venue was improper and therefore transferred the case to this Court. Dkt. nos. 11, 13.  The Hawaii Court’s screening review under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 was limited to the venue issue.  Following assignment of the case to the undersigned, on April 23, 2023, the Court screened  Plaintiff’s claims and concluded that Plaintiff \nstated viable claims.  Dkt. no. 30.  The Court therefore ordered the United States Marshal to serve the complaint but also addressed the Plaintiff’s filing of numerous documents unrelated to the case, ordering as follows:  \nThe Court FURTHER ORDERS that Plaintiff shall file no further \ndocuments in this case unless he has a reasonable and good faith belief that the document is permitted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Civil Local Rules of this Court. Plainti ff has filed \nten documents in the last week, with titles such as “My initial reaction to Microsoft desktop automation technology” (dkt. 23), “Initial reaction to Microsoft desktop automation technology and news commentary related to equity” (dkt. 24), “Jus tification for a 2 million \ndollar settlement” (dkt. 26), “Justification for a 2.8 million dollar settlement” (dkt. 27), “Justification for a 3 million dollar settlement” (dkt. 28), and “Communication with the bank about Microsoft Desktop more fun (emails)”  (dkt. 29). To the extent these filings \ncontain arguments and evidence in support of Plaintiff’s claims, they are premature at this stage of the case. Failure to comply with this order will be grounds for the imposition of sanctions and may result in the r evocation of Plaintiff’s ECF filing privileges.  \nId.   \nPlaintiff did not adhere to the Court’s order, however, and therefore the Court ordered \nstricken a series of documents  that were not authorized under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nor the Court’s local rules .  See dkt. nos. 66, 70, 72, 74, 76, 79, 82.  In addressing Plaintiff’s \nimproper filings, the Court  issued another warning on July 18, 2023:  \nTHE COURT FURTHER CAUTIONS PLAINTIFF THAT HIS Case 3:23-cv-01161-JCS     Document 119     Filed 08/05/24     Page 2 of 10 \n3 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ONGOING ABUSIVE LITIGATION TACTICS AND \nDISREGARD FOR THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, THE LOCAL RULES OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS COURT’S ORDERS MAY RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS, UP TO AN INCLUDING DISMISSAL OF THIS ACTION WITH \nPREJUDICE.  \nDkt. no. 76. On July 28, 2023, the Court further ordered as follows:  \nPlaintiff has ignored the Court’s repeated warnings and continues to engage in abusive litigation tactics, filing several improper documents and motions every day that must be manually docketed by the Clerk’s Office and reviewed by the Court. These filings  are imposing a \nsignificant burden on Defendant and the Court, and this burden is at the expense of other litigants with pending cases before the undersigned. Therefore, pending further order of the Court, no further filings from Plaintiff will be accepted  from Plaintiff except ONE case \nmanagement statement prior to the September 15, 2023 scheduled case management conference.  \nDkt. no. 82. \nIn the meantime, Plaintiff repeatedly called and emailed  Court staff for no legitimate \npurpose, prompting the Court to prohibit such communications.  See dkt. no. 59.  The Court stated:  \nIn the past 72 hours, Mr. Bonazza has sent more than 85 emails to court staff. These communications impose a significant burden on the Court and will no longer be permitted. Going forward, Mr. Bonazza \nis prohibited from emailing or telephoning Courtroom De puty Karen \nHom for any reason. All emails that have been received by Ms. Hom from Mr. Bonazza have been deleted and any future emails will be blocked. Emails to the Court are not part of the record of this case. Any future communications must be made in fi led documents. \nFurther, as the Court has already cautioned Mr. Bonazza, he may only file a document in this case if he has a reasonable and good faith belief that it is permitted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Civil Local Rules of this Court. See dkt. no. 30. Documents that are not in compliance with those rules will be stricken from the record. All documents must be filed through the Clerk’s Office. Mr. Bonazza is not permitted to efile in this case.  \nDkt. no. 59. \nAt the September 15, 2023 Case Management Conference, the Court prohibited Plaintiff \nfrom sending emails to the Court and limited Plaintiff to two emails a week to opposing counsel. \nDkt. no. 93.  A status report re compliance filed by Defendant on December 8, 2023, dkt. no. 98, indicated that Plaintiff was not adhering to this limit.  Among the numerous missives sent to counsel were multiple (15- 20) versions of a Power Point presentation outlining Bonazza’s \n“business case” with respect to his settlement demands.  Dkt. no. 98 & Ex. G.  According to Case 3:23-cv-01161-JCS     Document 119     Filed 08/05/24     Page 3 of 10 \n4 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendant, “[w] hile unclear, the power point slides seem to suggest that Plaintiff believes he is \nentitled to a multi- million or even multibillion dollar settlement for reasons that are completely \nunrelated to his discrimination claim or his employment with Defendant (fr om which he \nvoluntarily resigned), such as Amazon and JP Morgan’s investments in Artificial Intelligence.”  Id.  \nThe Court also continued to receive numerous emails from Plaintiff without any legitimate \npurpose.  T herefore, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause Why Case Should Not be \nDismissed with Prejudice.  Dkt. no. 99. At that point, Plaintiff alerted the Court by email that he wished to file a motion to withdraw consent to magistrate jurisdiction and the Court promptl y \ninstructed the Clerk’s Office that any such filing should be accepted.  Dkt. no. 100.  Plaintiff has not filed any such motion, however.  \nAt the January 12, 2024 case management conference  and show cause hearing, Plaintiff \nagain agreed to limit his email communications and the Court expunged the order to show cause.  Dkt. no. 102.  But a  status report from Defendant filed on February 9, 2024 indicates that Plaintiff \ncontinued to send Defendant numerous irrelevant emails (in the month that had elapsed since the \nshow cause hearing Defendant had received 34 emails), many related his efforts to purchase a house and his plan to finance it with funds he hoped to obtain by settling this case. See dkt. no. 105.  \nPlaintiff’s improper emails continued.  For example, on February 26, 2024, Plaintiff sent at \na series of emails to Defendant’s counsel, starting with one at 8:11 a.m. stating: “ If I win I will \ntake up to the amount I owe my partner and for her medical, but I am effectively taking myself out of the picture after this week .”  At 9:59 a.m. he sent an email stating: \nHi Nate,   \n \nIf the plan is to wait to make a decision in August, I'd like to enter a motion to dismiss my case.  \n I'll go back to renting.  \n Thanks,  Mike  Case 3:23-cv-01161-JCS     Document 119     Filed 08/05/24     Page 4 of 10 \n5 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   At 9:26 p.m. on the same day he sent an email to counsel stating: “ I couldn’ t take the money even \nif I won if the timing is wrong .”  Two minutes later he sent an email to counsel stating: “ The \ntransaction is too egalitarian and the valuation is too big.”  On the same day, at 3:20 p.m. Plaintiff sent an email to the court stating: “ Fyi. I will be seeking to a [sic] motion to close this case absent \na settlement in the next week. ”  No such motion was ever filed.  \nOn May 6, 2024 at 10:57 pm, Plaintiff sent an email to the undersigned magistrate judge \nstating:  \nDear Magistrate,  \nIf im  being honest, I think it's a disgrace that you're letting a foreign country clown \nAmerica by not allowing me to win timely and decisively. Ryan Reynolds is out here \ndoing a victory lap because he knows this country is weak.  \nTwo minutes later, he sent the Court another email stating: “You let everyone get away with \nmurder so that you can block homeownership for someone who deserves it. Why?”  \nOn May 7, 2024 at 2:01 a.m. Pacific Time, Plaintiff sent the Court an email with the \ncaption, “Disgraceful,” stating: “I did my job. The question is will you.” At 2:57 p.m. and again at \n3:01 pm that same day, Plaintiff sent the Court an email entitled “Where is my f***ing opinion.” On this email, Plaintiff also copied defense counsel and an individual who is Defendant’s Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. The Court notes that at the time this email was sent there were no pending motions in the  case.  \nDefendant filed its Motion for Protective Order on May 10, 2024. The supporting \ndeclaration of counsel  states that the emails  sent at 2:57 and 3:01 pm  on May 7, 2024 (described \nabove) “came after [Defendant’s counsel]  emailed [Plaintiff] on May 5, 2024 to explicitly remind \nhim not to contact Mr. Escher or any other MUFG employees and to instead direct communications through [him and his] office.”   Declaration of Nathaniel H. Jenkins in Support of MUFG  Bank, Ltd.’s Motion f or Protective Order, dkt. no. 106- 2 (“Jenkins Protective Order \nDecl.”) ¶ 4 & Exs. B, C.   Counsel further states that he has “asked Plaintiff numerous  times, \nthrough email, by formal written correspondence, and over the phone, to please stop the burdensome, harassing emails.”  Id.  ¶ 5 .  These requests include letters sent by counsel to Plaintiff Case 3:23-cv-01161-JCS     Document 119     Filed 08/05/24     Page 5 of 10 \n6 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  on August 16, 2023 and October 17, 2023.  Id.  ¶ 5 & Ex. D.  Defendant’s letters describe in detail \nPlaintiff’s harassing conduct, which included sending “over 1,000 emails within only a few months ,” sending multiple versions of the same document, and on one occasion, filing what was \npurportedly a “joint” case management conference statement without Defendant’s consent.  Id. , \nEx. D. \nCounsel also describes the deposition of Plaintiff taken by Defendant on April 18, 2024, \n“after which [Bonazza]  reached out several times about ‘settlement’ and even included a subject \nline of: ‘I want more money.’” Id.  ¶ 6 & Ex. F.  According to counsel, “Plaintiff has made clear \nmultiple times throughout this litigation that he is pursuing his claims to obtain settlement monies to buy a house.”  Id.  In his deposition, Plaintiff stated: “I was, like, I want to buy this house, but I \ncan’t buy this house unless I’m successful in my employment litigation.” Id. , Ex. F -8.  Plaintiff \nalso sent Defendant’s counsel emails with the subject line, “I literally just want to buy a house,” and other emails that repeatedly and urgently asked Defendant to “close” on a settlement.   Id., Ex. \nF-1. \nIn his deposition, Bonazza also appears to have conceded that his underlying claim that his \nemployment contract was discriminatory is unfounded.  In particular, he testified that “it was very clear to [him], after a couple of months, that [there was] nothing wrong with the contract.”  Declaration of Nathaniel H. Jenkins in Support of Defendant MUDG Bank, Ltd.’s Response to Second Order to Show Cause why Case Should Not be Dismissed with Prejudice, dkt. no. 116 (“Jenkins OSC Decl.”), Ex. A ( Bonazza deposition excerpt) at 46- 47, 71- 72.  He further testified \nthat he resigned from his position at MUFG because he “wanted to stay with credit cards because that’s kind of where [his] strength was” but instead he was “pull[ed] . . . away from that” and “put \non a couple of other projects.” Jenkins Protective Order Decl., Ex. H -2 (Bonazza deposition \nexcerpt) at 120 -121).  \nSoon after Defendant filed its Motion for Protective Order, Plaintiff filed three motion s for \nsummary judgment, dkt. nos. 108, 109 and 111.  Although the Court had previously issued to Plaintiff a notice “to explain to the pro se plaintiff how the summary judgment process works and the consequences if a summary judgment motion is granted in the defendant’s favor[,]” dkt. no. Case 3:23-cv-01161-JCS     Document 119     Filed 08/05/24     Page 6 of 10 \n7 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  62, Plaintiff did not offer any evidence in support of his motions.  Nor did he address any of the specific facts of the case. For this reason, the Court denied the motions  on May 29, 2024, \nobserving that “[n] o supporting brief was filed; nor did Plaintiff offer any evidence to support his \nrequest for summary judgment .”  Dkt. no. 112.  The Court concluded, “ Having failed to address \nhis specific claim or offer any evidence or argument related to that claim, Plaintiff has not established that he is entitled to su mmary judgment based on the undisputed facts.”  Id.  \nOn May 30, 2024, in response to the evidence supplied in support of the Motion for \nProtective Order, the Court issued a second order to show cause  why the case should not be \ndismissed with prejudice due to Plaintiff’s harassing and abusive conduct.  Dkt. no. 113 (“Second Order to Show Cause”).  The Court ordered that responses be filed by June 14, 2024.  \nPlaintiff filed a brief response to the Second Order to Show Cause  on June 10, 2024, \nstating, in its entirety, as follows: \nThis case should not be dismissed because of the merits of the case. \nPlaintiff has asked for summary judgment consistent with guidelines \nabout timely justice.  \nDkt. no. 114. \n At the August 2, 2024 hearing, Plaintiff offered no justification for failing to comply with \nthe Court’s orders as to emails  to Court staff and opposing counsel  except to insist that he sent \nthem to “get to the right answer” and to “drive[] the process forward” as the Court did not issue a \ndecision on the merits in response to his February 9, 2024 status report , see dkt. no. 104, which he \ndescribed as a summary judgment motion.  The Court explained to Plaintiff that his status report did not conform to the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing summary judgment motions and that treating a status report as a summary judgment motion would be improper, in response to which P laintiff accused  the Court of “corruption.”   \nIII. WHETHER THE COURT SHOULD DISMISS THIS CASE UNDER ITS \nINHERENT POWERS  \nA. Legal Standards   \n“All federal courts are vested with inherent powers enabling them to manage their cases \nand courtrooms effectively and to ensure obedience to their orders  . . . . As a function of this Case 3:23-cv-01161-JCS     Document 119     Filed 08/05/24     Page 7 of 10 \n8 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  power, courts can dismiss cases in their entirety, bar witnesses, award attorney’ s fees and assess \nfines.” F.J. Hanshaw Enters., Inc. v. Emerald River Dev., Inc ., 244 F.3d 1128, 1136 (9th Cir. \n2001) (citations omitted) ; see also Chambers v. NASCO, Inc ., 501 U.S. 32, 45 (1991)  (“outright \ndismissal of a lawsuit . . . is a particularly severe sanction, yet is within the court’s discretion.”) . \nhe orderly administration of justice.” Anheuser –Busch , 69 F.3d at 348 (internal quotation marks \nand citations omitted).  “Before imposing the ‘harsh sanction’ of dismissal . . . the district court \nshould consider the following factors: ‘(1) the public’s interest in expeditious resolution of litigation; (2) the court’s need to manage its dockets; (3) the risk of prejudice to the party seeking sanctions; (4) the public policy favori ng disposition of cases on their merits; and (5) the \navailability of less drastic sanctions.’” Leon v. IDX Sys. Corp., 464 F.3d 951, 958 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Anheuser -Busch, Inc. v. Nat. Beverage Distributors , 69 F.3d 337, 348 (9th Cir. 1995)). \nFurther , “[f] or dismissal to be proper, the conduct to be sanctioned must be due to willfulness, \nfault, or bad faith.”  Anheuser -Busch, Inc. v. Nat. Beverage Distributors , 69 F.3d at 348 (citations \nand internal quotations omitted) ;  see also Fink v. Gomez , 239 F.3d 989, 994 (9th Cir. 2001) \n(holding that “ sanctions are available if the court specifically finds bad faith or conduct \ntantamount to bad faith” and that “[s] anctions are available for a variety of types of willful actions, \nincluding recklessness when combi ned with an additional factor such as frivolousness, \nharassment, or an improper purpose. ”).  \nB. Bad Faith  \nThe evidence of bad faith in this case is ample.  Plaintiff has repeatedly ignored the Court’s \norders and the requests of counsel with respect to his communications with counsel, the Court, and employees of MUFG Bank, sending thousands of unrelated emails, some of which are abusive in tone.  This conduct has risen to the  level of harassment and supports a finding of bad faith.  \nC. Public Interest , Court’s Need to Manage its Docket and Public Policy  \nIn considering whether dismissal is appropriate, courts are instructed to balance the \npublic’s interest in expeditious litigation, the public policy in favor of resolving cases on the merits and the Court’s need to manage its own docket.  Because of Plaintiff’s ongoing refusal to comply with the Court’s orders with respect to his abusive and harassing litigation of the case, the  Case 3:23-cv-01161-JCS     Document 119     Filed 08/05/24     Page 8 of 10 \n9 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  public’s interest in expeditious litigation and the need to manage the Court’s docket point in favor of dismissal.  On the other hand, dismissal will prevent the Court from reaching the merits of the case, which is generally disfavored . \nD. Risk of Prejudice to Defendant  \nDefendant has presented evidence that Plaintiff’s abusive litigation practices have imposed \na significant  burden on it, with counsel being forced to screen a  large volume of communications \nthat Plaintiff has sent and employees of Defendant ’s employees  being subjected to abusive emails \nsent to them directly from Plaintiff.  These voluminous and sometimes confusing emails make defending this case extremely burdensome and hamper the ability of counsel to effectively defend their client.  Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiff’s conduct  has prejudiced Defendant.    \nE. Availability of Less Drastic Sanction  \nThe Court questions whether  there is a  less drastic sanction available that will be effective \nas it has repeatedly warned Plaintiff about his misconduct and ordered him to cease his abusive litigation practices and Plaintiff has consistently ignored those warnings.   \nIV. CONCLUSION \nThe factors discussed above, on balance, support  dismissal  of this action under  the Court’s  \ninherent powers.  Because the Court is reluctant to deprive Plaintiff of the opportunity to obtain a \nruling on the merits  in this case, however, it will give him one more chance to proceed with the \ncase so long as his abusive litigation tactics cease and he abides by the Court’s orders going forward.  Therefore, the Court GRANTS the Motion for Protective Order, expunges the Second OSC and orders as follows:  \n• Plaintiff is prohibited from sending emails to Court staff.  \n• Plaintiff ’s communications with Defendant relating to this case shall be solely \nthrough counsel; as Plaintiff agreed at the hearing, Plaintiff shall not contact  directly any MUFG employee  in connection with this case . \n• Each side will be permitted to file one motion for summary judgment, which shall be filed by September 3, 2024. Opposition briefs will be due on September 24, 2024.  Reply briefs shall be filed by October 8, 2024.  The Clerk is instructed to Case 3:23-cv-01161-JCS     Document 119     Filed 08/05/24     Page 9 of 10 \n10 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  accept for filing Plaintiff’s motion papers in connection with these summary judgment motions. The Court will determine after briefing is completed whether a \nmotion hearing is required. \nPlaintiff ’s failure to comply with this Order with respect to email to the Court or \ncontacting Defendant’s employees may result in dismissal of this case with prejudice . \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDated:   August 5, 2024  \n______________________________________ \nJOSEPH C.

    "summary": "1. Summary:\n   James Dean Kendrick filed multiple Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests seeking records about his criminal conviction from the DEA. Dissatisfied with the DEA's response, which included some redacted documents, he pursued legal action. The court ruled that while most DEA searches were adequate, exemptions validly applied to redacted materials, but it also found some searches inadequate and mandated further searching.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\n   The key legal issue in this case was whether the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) conducted sufficient searches and properly applied FOIA exemptions when withholding information from Kendrick.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\n   The court granted and denied motions for summary judgment in part, acknowledging that the DEA's application of exemptions to the redactions was appropriate, but the court found that some searches were inadequate and required the DEA to conduct further searches to ensure comprehensive compliance with Kendrick’s FOIA requests.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation:\n   Imagine you're trying to get all the information about a time you were caught pulling a prank but some details are blacked out. Kendrick wanted to see all the files from the DEA on his case. The DEA searched their computers and found some papers, but not all. The court told the DEA to look harder and double-check some places, while agreeing with the DEA that some information needed to be kept secret to protect people's privacy and safety.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  \n \nJAMES DEAN KENDRICK ,  \n \nPlaintiff , \n \nv.       \n \nDRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION, \n \nDefendant .   \n  \n Case No. 21- cv-01624 (TNM) \n \nMEMORANDUM O PINION \n  \nJames Dean Kendrick  submitted multiple FOIA requests to the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration for records  pertaining to him.  The agency conducted several  searches and \nreleased 28 pages, with some material redacted.   Dissatisfied with that  resp onse, Kendrick  filed \nthis lawsuit.   \nBoth parties now move for summary judgment.  The Court holds that, on this record, \nsome of DEA’s searches were inadequate.  But the Court also concludes that for the material \nalready disclosed, the agency has properly invoked various FOIA exemptions.  The Court will therefore grant in part and deny in part both motions. \nI.   \n This FOIA case begi ns with a criminal conviction.  In 2016, a federal court  sentenced \nKendrick to “life imprisonment plus 30 years” for his involvement in a drug ring.  ECF No. 937, United States v. Kendrick, et al., No. 6:10- cr-6096 (W.D.N.Y.).  To s ubstantiate alleged \nprosecutorial errors related to his conviction, Kendrick filed a FOIA request with the DEA.  See \nCompl. at 2, ECF No. 1.  He sought (1) his NADDIS report, which refers to “an electronic data index system” used by DEA to locate records, Decl. of Angela Hertel ¶  6, ECF No. 14- 5 (Hertel Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 1 of 142 \n Decl.); (2)  his DEA investigative file ; (3) DEA forms pertaining “directly or indirectly” to him;  \nand (4) correspondence the DEA sent him at a New York county jail about  the seizure of money \nat the time of his arrest , see id.  ¶ 8.   \nDEA conducted multiple searches.  It first queried the NADDIS database and found one \ninvestigative file associated with Kendrick , the paper copy of which had been  destroyed by a \nfield office .  See id.  ¶ 9.  But the age ncy located an electronic copy in an “electronic file room.”  \nId. ¶ 11.  That file amounted to four pages.  See id. ¶  11.  And because Kendrick had asked about \na seizure, DEA sent a search request to its Asset Forfeiture Section  (AFS) , which located ten \nrelevant pa ges.  See id. ¶  10.  The agency released all 14 pages , with redactions on eight of them .  \nSee id.  ¶ 12. \n Kendrick appealed that response within the Department of Justice , DEA’s parent agency .  \nSee id.  ¶ 13.  The Department remanded the request for more searches, and DEA sent a search \nrequest to its Office of Administration, Investigative Records Unit, to locate logs showing who \nhad searched  NADDIS for Kendrick’s files.  See id. ¶¶ 13–14.  That Unit loc ated two pages.  See \nid. ¶ 15.  DEA also located three pages comprising Kendrick’s NADDIS report.  See id. ¶  16.  \nThe agency released those five pages with some redactions .  See id.  ¶¶ 1 5–16.   \nKendrick then filed another FOIA request that largely duplicat ed his earlier one but also \nsought any documents about the destruction of  his investigative file.  See id.  ¶ 17.  DEA \nresponded that “ everything related to his NADDIS report, the investigative file, and any other \ninvestigative records” had been released  previously.  I d. ¶ 18.  And as for  the destruction of  his \nfile, DEA released both its search request to the field office and th at office’s  response that it had \ndestroyed the paper files.  See id.  ¶ 18.  That release amounted to three pages, meaning the \nagency had released 22 pages  in to tal, 14 with redactions.  See id.  ¶ 19.  For those redactions, Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 2 of 143 \n DEA invoked FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), 7(E), and 7(F).  See id.  \nDissatisfied with the agency’s response, Kendrick filed this suit,  pro se , arguing that the \nDEA’s searches were inadequate and that the agency improperly relied on the exemptions.  See \ngenerally Compl.  DEA move d for summary judgment , see Def ’s. MSJ, ECF N o. 14, and \nKendrick cross -move d for the same, s ee Pl.’s MSJ, ECF No. 19- 1.  After th e motions became \nripe, however, DEA conducted another search of the AFS and found six more responsive pages.  \nSee Attach to Supp. Memo., ECF No. 25- 1.  The agency released those pages with some \nredactions under the same exemptions as before.  \nThe cross -motions are now ripe for decision.1 \nII.   \nTo prevail on a motion for summary judgment, a party must show that “there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  FOIA requires “disclosure of documents held by a federal agency unless the documents fall within one of nine  enumerated \nexemptions, which are listed at 5 U.S.C. § 552(b).”  U.S. Fish & Wildlife Serv. v. Sierra Club, Inc., 141 S. Ct. 777, 785 (2021) .  To obtain summary judgment, the agency bears the burden to \nshow the applicability of the claimed exemptions.  See ACLU v. DOD, 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011) .  This burden does not shift even when the requester cross -moves  for summary \njudgment.  See Hardy v. ATF , 243 F. Supp. 3d 155, 162 (D.D.C. 2017) .  Courts construe FOIA  \nexemptions narrowly, see Milne r v. Dep’t of the Navy , 562 U.S. 562, 565 (2011) , and review \ntheir applicability de novo, s ee King v. DOJ , 830 F.2d 210, 217 (D.C. Cir. 1987) . \nTo meet its burden, an agency may rely on declarations describing the applicability of a \nFOIA exemption to information that the agency has withheld.  See Shapiro v. DOJ , 893 F.3d \n \n1  The  Court has jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and 28 U.S.C. § 1331 . Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 3 of 144 \n 796, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2018).  Those declarations receive “a presumption of good faith.”  SafeCard \nServs., Inc. v. SEC , 926 F.2d 1197, 1200 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  The Court may grant summary \njudgment based solely on the agency’s declarations if they are unimpeached  by contrary record \nevidence or by evidence of the agency’s bad faith.   See Aguiar v. DEA , 865 F.3d 730, 734–35 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017) .  Most FOIA cases reso lve at this stage.  See AARC v. CIA, 317 F. Supp. 3d 394, \n399 (D.D.C. 2018), aff'd , 781 F ed. App ’x. 11 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam). \nKendrick proceeds pro se , so the Court “liberally construe[s]” his filings.  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).  That accommodation does not, however, allow him “to ignore \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.”  Oviedo v. WMATA , 948 F.3d 386, 397 (D.C. Cir. 2020) ; \nRaven v. Sajet , 334 F. Supp. 3d 22, 28 (D.D.C. 2018)  (noting that for pro se  plaintiffs, “ the \nultimate standard remains the same ”).  He st ill must show that a genuine issue of material fact \nexists as to whether the agency has inappropriately withheld records.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \nIII. \nKendrick  challenges the adequacy of DEA’s search es and its invocation of FOIA \nexemptions .  See genera lly Pl.’s  Stmt.  of Undisputed Facts and Stmt. of Genuine Issues, ECF \nNo. 19- 3.  The Court first analyzes the searches  and then t he exemptions . \nA. \nFirst, the searches.  The adequacy of a search does not turn on “whether there might be” \nmore uncovered documents.  Kowalczyk v. DOJ, 73 F.3d 386, 388 (D.C. Cir. 1996) .  A search \ninstead is adequate if the agency shows that its search method “was reasonably calculated to \nuncove r all relevant documents.”  Oglesby v. Dep’t of Army , 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990) .  \nThe agency can carry its burden through affidavits “setting forth the search terms and the type of search performed[ ] and averring that all files likely to contain responsive materials  . . . were Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 4 of 145 \n searched [.]”  Id.   Any information about the agency’s search must be “specific enough to enable \n[plaintiffs] to challenge the procedures utilized.”  Weisberg v. DOJ, 627 F.2d 365, 371 (D.C. Cir. \n1980) .   \nOnce the agency has pro vided the necessary detail , the plaintiff must produce \n“countervailing evidence” showing a genuine dispute of material fact about the search’s  \nadequacy.  Iturralde v. Comptroller of Currency , 315 F.3d 311, 314–16 (D.C. Cir. 2003)  \n(cleaned up) .  Above all, “[i]f the record leaves substantial doubt as to the sufficiency of the \nsearch, summary judgment for the agency is not proper.” Kowalczyk , 73 F.3d at 388 (cleaned \nup).   \nAcross the two requests, DEA searched NADDIS, the Asset Forfeiture Section, the \nunnamed “electronic file room,” Hertel Decl. ¶  11, and the agency’s Office of Administration, \nInvestigative Records Unit.  Kendrick focuses most , however, on the destruction of  his paper \ninvestigative file.  DEA sent a search request for that file to the field office where the matter \noriginated.  See id. ¶  9.  Recall, however, that the office said it had destroyed the paper copies per  \nthe agency’s Record Management Schedule.  Se e id.  Kendrick says otherwise.  In his Complaint \nand his appeals within DOJ, he argued that DEA never destroys such files.  See Compl. ¶  25(6).  \nBut he includes no evidence supporting this assertion, relying instead on conclusory statements \nto rebut the agency’s declaration on this point.  Speculation is not enough to overcome the good -\nfaith presumption afforded that declaration.  Accord Eddington v. DOD , 35 F.4th 833, 839 (D.C. \nCir. 2022). \nMore, Kendrick has not refuted or otherwise questioned DEA’s later  search of the \nelectronic file room that yielded “a complete electronic version” of the investigative file.  Hertel Decl. ¶  11.  So even if DEA improperly destroyed the paper files, it has provided those files in Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 5 of 146 \n electronic form , complying with its duty to “search for the [requested] records in electronic form \nor format.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(C).  Because Kendrick does not refute that statement,2 the \nCourt credits it and rejects his assertion  that a genuine issue of material fact remains about the \ndestruc tion of  his paper file.  \nThat leaves the other three searches.  Kendrick never clearly states which of these he \nchallenges, instead asserting broadly that the agency never met its “duty to search for and locate \nrecords and documents.”  Pl.’s MSJ at 3 , ECF N o. 20; see also Pl.’s Reply at 7 (there is “a \ngenuine issue of material fact  . . . as to whether the DEA has conducted a reasonable search for \nresponsive records ”).3  Guided by the instruction to construe pro se filings broadly, see Erickson , \n551 U.S. at 94, the Court assumes that Kendrick challenges the adequacy of all other searches.  \nThe Court takes them in turn. \nFirst, the search of NADDIS.  When queried, that system allows DEA to locate any \n“intelligence and investigative records generat ed across all DEA offices.”  Hertel Decl. ¶  7.  The \nagency searches NADDIS through certain terms like a person’s “name, Social Security number, or date of birth.”  Id. ¶ 6.  NADDIS therefore is  a reasonable place to search for documents about \nKendrick.  An d the agency did so “using [Kendrick]’s name.”  Id.  ¶ 9.  Because the agency \nsearched a database likely to have responsive records and testifies that it used an appropriate search term, that search of NADDIS was adequate.  \nNot so for the searches of AFS and the Office of Administration.  To begin with, the  \n \n2  At most, Kendrick challenges the knowledge of Angela Hertel, the agency’s declarant.  See \nPl.’s Reply at 1, ECF No. 24.  His criticisms go nowhere.  Hertel “oversee[s] the processing” of \nFOIA requests and is therefore familiar with the agency’s “policies  and practices.”  Hertel Decl. \n¶ 2.  Thus, she “has a general familiarity with the responsive records and procedures used to \nidentify those records”  and is an adequate declarant.   Barnard v. DHS, 531 F. Supp. 2d 131, 138 \n(D.D.C. 2008).  \n   \n3  All page citat ions refer to the page numbers generated by the Court’s CM/ECF system.  Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 6 of 147 \n Court agrees with the agency that, because Kendrick sought records  about a seizure, AFS “was \nan appropriate office to search.”  Id.  ¶ 10.  But DEA says nothing more about how it conducted \nthat search.  It says that AFS used Kendrick’s “name ” to locate ten pages, but not  how it used his \nname to find those ten pages.  DEA’s declaration thus merely states the search’s results  without \n“information about its search strategies,” Morley v. CIA , 508 F.3d 1108, 1122 (D.C. Cir. 2007), \nor about  “how [ AFS] searched within” its own files , Aguiar , 865 F.3d at 738.  More, AFS \nunearthed more pages recently , creating “substantial doubt” as to the thoroughness of the initial \nAFS searches.  Kowalczyk , 73 F.3d at 388.  The Court therefore will grant Kendrick’s cross -\nmotion as to th e AFS search.  \nDitto the search of the Office of Administration.  About this searc h, DEA says that it \n“sent a search request to the Office of Administration, Investigative Records Unit , to locate the \nNADDIS Access Logs.  This search identified two (2) pages of records there were released in \npart via correspondence dated June 15, 2017.”  Hertel Decl. ¶  15.  That’s all.  Nothing about how \nthe Office located the logs or how this search was conducted .  Based on such a light record, the \nCourt cannot determine whether this search was adequate.  See DeBrew v. Atwood , 792 F.3d 118, \n122 (D.C. Cir . 2015).  The Court thus will grant Kendrick’s motion for summary judgment as to \nthis search.  Accord  Louise Trauma Ctr. v. DHS, No. 20- cv-1128 (TNM), 2022 WL 1081097, at \n*4 (D.D.C. Apr. 11, 2022) (granting plaintiff  summary judgment for search that agency di d not \nproperly describe).  \nB. \nThe Court now turns to the exemptions asserted by DEA.  Recall that the agency redact ed \ninformation under FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), 7(E) and 7(F).  T he agency must show why a \nparticular exemption applies .  But that is not all.  T he agency must also “reasonably foresee[] Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 7 of 148 \n that disclosure” of the material “would harm an interest protected” by a FOIA exemption.  5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(8)(A)(i)(I).   Agencies must articulate this foreseeable harm in a “focused and \nconcrete”  way .  Reps. Comm.  for Freedom of the Press v. FBI , 3 F.4th 350, 370 (D.C. Cir. 2021) .  \nBut even without a sufficient explanation from the agency, the “context and purpose” of withheld information can support a finding of foreseeable harm.  Id . at 372.  And as this Court \nexplained more fully in Reporters Committee  v. CBP , agencies can  more easily meet their \nforeseeable harm burden when invoking exemptions “for which the risk of harm through disclosure is more self -evident.”  567 F. Supp. 3d 97, 120 (D.D.C. 2021).  \nWith these principles in mind, the Court addresses DEA’s reliance on the various \nexemptions. \n1. \nFirst, a clarification on the exemptions at issue .  DEA invokes Exemption 6 and  \nExemption 7(C) , see Vaughn Index (VI), ECF No. 14- 4, which permit an agency to withhold \ninformation the disclosure of which would violate personal privacy, see Reps. Comm.  v. CBP , \n567 F. Supp. 3d at 125.  Though similar, 7(C) “provides broader privacy protections” and “thus establi shes a lower bar for withholding material.”   CREW v. DOJ , 854 F.3d 675, 681 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) .  So when agencies rely on both Exemptions 6 and 7(C) for the same material, the Court \nneed not “ consider Exemption 6 separately[.]”  Roth v. DOJ , 642 F.3d 1161, 1173 (D.C. Cir. \n2011) .  Here, DEA always invokes  the two exemptions in tandem.  See Hertel Decl. ¶  31.  The \nCourt thus considers only Exemption 7(C). \nWith Exemption 6 out of the picture, only Exemption 7 remains .  To justify \nnondisclosure under that Exemption, the withheld material must be compiled  “for law \nenforcement purposes .”  Shapiro v. DOJ , 893 F.3d 796, 800 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (cleaned up).  DEA Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 8 of 149 \n asserts that it gathered these records under its “law enforcement responsibility,” Hertel Decl. \n¶ 23, and as part of its “investigative authority” to enforce drug laws, id. ¶ 26.  Kendrick does not \nsay otherwise, so the Court considers only whether the  information meets the conditions of \nExemption 7’s subparts.  See ACLU v. DOJ, 655 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n2. \nUnder 7(C), DEA redacted the names and other identifying information of third- party \nindividuals, including those of law enforcement personnel.  See Hertel Decl. ¶ 31.  That exemption covers  law enforcement records that “could reasonably be expected to constitute \nan unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).  “To determine whether an invasion of privacy is ‘unwarranted,’  courts balance the privacy interest against \nthe public interest in disclosure, including any potential interest in airing governmental misconduct.”  Prot . Democracy Project, Inc. v. N SA, 10 F.4th 879, 889 (D.C. Cir. 2021).   \nThe individuals have a more than cognizable privacy interest  here.  T he D.C. Circuit \nhas “consistently supported nondisclosure of names or other information identifying individuals appearing in law enforcement records, including investigators, suspects, witnesses, informants ,” Schrecker v. DOJ , 349 F.3d 657, 661 (D.C. Cir. 2003) , and “federal \ngovernment personnel,” CREW , 854 F.3d at 681; see also Blackwell v. FBI , 646 F.3d 37, 41 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011)  (“As a result of E xemption 7(C) , FOIA ordinarily does not require \ndisclosure of law enforcement documents (or portions thereof) that contain private \ninformation.” ).    \nThe Court now  “must balance the [substantial] privacy interests involved against the \npublic interest in disclosure .”  SafeCard Servs., Inc., 926 F.2d at  1205.  Kendrick bea rs the \nburden to show that interest.  See NARA v. Favish , 541 U.S. 157, 172 (2004) .  And the “only Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 9 of 1410 \n relevant public interest ” in the balancing analysis is “ the extent to which disclosure  . . . would \nshed light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties or otherwise let citizens know \nwhat their government  is up to.”  EPIC v. DOJ , 18 F.4th 712, 720–21 (D.C. Cir. 2021)  \n(cleaned up) . \nKendrick suggest s no such interest.  He says instead that “he has a personal interest in \nobtaining the withheld documents and information . . . to help him fight his criminal case.”  Pl.’s Reply at 3.  That is indeed a weighty personal interest.  But such a  “personal stake in the \nrelease of the [redacted]  information i s irrelevant to the balancing ” required by 7(C).  Roth , \n642 F.3d at  1177;  see also DOD v. FLRA , 510 U.S. 487, 496 (1994)  (“[E]xcept in certain \ncases involving claims of privilege, the identity of the requesting party” and his motives simply have “no bearing on the merits” of a FOIA claim. ).     \nKendrick makes three other assertions , none persuasive .  First , he posits that the names \n“would not have been redacted if [the] documents were disclosed in discovery” and states that some names in fact were “released in the discovery of [his] 2000 State Drug Case.”  Pl.’s \nMSJ at 6.  Perhaps, but the FOIA analysis is entirely separate from discovery.  See Stonehill v. IRS , 558 F.3d 534, 538 –39 (D.C. Cir. 2009) ; cf. EPIC v. Nat.’ l Sec. Comm ’n on Artificial \nIntelligence , 466 F. Supp. 3d 100, 104 (D.D.C. 2020) (finding agency subject  to two se parate \ndisclosure regimes  under FACA and FOIA) . \nSecond, Kendrick  questions the purported redaction  of some DEA form number s.  See \nPl.’s Opp’n at 6.  DEA clarifies  that the redacted initials of DEA law enforcement personnel \n“happen to be on top of the DEA form numbers ,” so the agency redacted those initials, not \nthe form numbers.  Def.’s Reply at 6 , ECF No. 22 .  This is  acceptable under FOIA, which \npermits nondisclosure of non- exempt material when “inextricably intertwined with exempt Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 10 of 1411 \n portions.”  Evans v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons , 951 F.3d 578, 583 (D.C. Cir. 2020)  (cleaned up) .   \nFinally , Kendrick  contends that the redacted names are in the public domain.  See Pl.’s \nReply at 4 –6.  A n agency may not rely on a FOIA exemption to withhold information that is \nin the “public dom ain.”  Davis v. DOJ, 968 F.2d 1276, 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  The  FOIA \nrequester  bears “ the initial burden of pointing to specific information in the public domain \nthat appears to duplicate that being withheld.”  Id . (cleaned up) .   \nKendrick does  nothing of the kind.  He merely offers  a long “list of witnesses [who]  \ntestified, for the Government” at his criminal trial “and who were also involved with the 2000 \ncase and/or [ i]nvestigation or work for the Rochester Police Department.”  Pl.’s Reply at 4 –5.  \nBecause FOIA disclosures are to the public at large, see Stonehi ll, 558 F.3d at 538, \nindividuals who testify at trial do not “waive the government’s right to invoke” exemptions in \nFOIA litigation .  Davis , 968 F.2d at 1281 (cleaned up).  And recall that  nondisclosure of the \nredacted names under Exemption 7(C) “r emains justified  where, as here, the public interest in \ndisclosure is virtually nonexistent.”  Id. at 1282.  More, the involvement of these names with \nhis case is not what DEA withheld.  The agency instead withheld their signatures and initial s \non forms an d paperwork.  Kendrick offers no reason to think those identifiers on these \nparticular documents are already in the public domain. \nThis brings us to the foreseeable harm from disclosure.  As this Court has noted, \nfulfilling the terms of exemptions outside  Exemption 5 “goes a long way to meeting the \nforeseeable harm requirement.”  Reps. Comm. v. CBP , 567 F. Supp. 3d at 127.  Given the \nlower burden, DEA says little but enough.  It asserts that disclosure would cause invasions of \nprivacy and would subject the  named individuals to “harassment,” “derogatory inferences,” \nand “suspicion.”  Hertel Decl. ¶  28.  “These predicted results of disclosure are exactly what Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 11 of 1412 \n Exemption 7(C) seeks to prevent[.]”  Ecol. Rts. Found. v. EPA , 541 F. Supp. 3d 34, 65–66 \n(D.D.C. 2021).  DEA has thus shown a risk of foreseeable harm from disclosure of this \ninformation and has therefore properly invoked Exemption 7(C). \n3. \nNext to Exemption 7(E), which protects information that “would disclose techniques \nand procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or . . . guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumven tion of the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E).  DEA invoked the exemption to \nwithhold “sensitive case and file numbers, including NADDIS numbers and Geo- Drug \nEnforcement Program (G -DEP) identifiers.”  Hertel Decl. ¶ 33.   \nUnder this exemption, t he D.C. Circuit  has “set a relatively low bar for the agency,” \nrequiring it only to “ demonstrate logically how the release of the  requested information might \ncreate a risk of circumvention of the law.”  Blackwell, 646 F.3d at 42 ( cleaned up) .   \nDEA has done so.  It attests that disclosure of this information could identify “the \ninvestigative interest or priority given to such matters,” thereby  enabl ing suspects “to avoid \ndetection” or “apprehension” by changing “ their pattern of activity ” or creating “alibis for \nsuspected  activities.”   Hertel Decl. ¶  33.  “DEA’s redaction of G –DEP codes and NADDIS \nnumbers from records responsive to FOIA requests has been routinely upheld for [similar] reasons[.]”  McKneely v. DOJ , 132 F. Supp. 3d 44, 55 (D.D.C. 2015), aff ’d sub nom. \nMcKneely v. D EA, No. 15- 5317, 2016 WL 3040985 (D.C. Cir. May 5, 2016).  Kendrick does \nnot dispute DEA’s otherwise proper application of Exemption 7(E).  \nIn sum , the agency has shown a  self-evident risk of foreseeable harm .  If disclosed, \ncriminals could use these identifiers to change their activity and to evade detection.  See Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 12 of 1413 \n Hertel Decl. ¶  33.  DEA has t herefore met its burden on foreseeable harm.  The Court will \ngrant summary judgment to the agency on its withholdings under Exemption 7(E).  \n4. \nDEA also withheld information under Exemption 7(F) , which protects information that \n“could reasonably be expected  to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.”   5 \nU.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(F).  But the agency relied on that exemption “always in conjunction with \nExemption[] 7(C).”  Hertel Decl. ¶ 35.  Because the Court upheld the assertion of 7(C), it need not consider whether DEA properly invoked 7(F).  See Larson v. Dep’t of State , 565 \nF.3d 857, 862–63 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“[C]ourts may uphold agency action under one exemption without considering the applicability of the other.”).  \n5. \n To properly assert exemptions , DEA must  also “demonstrate that all reasonably \nsegregable material has been released.”  Johnson v. EOUSA , 310 F.3d 771, 776 (D.C. Cir. \n2002).  To meet this burden, the agency can rely on the combination of its declarations and Vaughn Ind ex.  See id.  The agency is also “entitled to a presumption that [it] complied with \nthe obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material.”  Sussman v. U.S. M arshals Serv., \n494 F.3d 1106, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  To overcome that presumption, Kendrick must provide a “quantum of evidence.”  Id.  \n DEA admittedly does not say much on segregability, but it says just enough.  The \nagency reviewed “[a]ll responsive informat ion” and withheld only that information that would \nimplicate one of the claimed exemptions.  Hertel Decl. ¶  38.  That is  barely enough to carry \nDEA’s burden.  And except for his argument about redacted file names, Kendrick marshals no evidence to overcome DEA’s representations about segregability.  The Court holds that DEA Case 1:21-cv-01624-TNM     Document 26     Filed 08/25/22     Page 13 of 1414 \n has fulfilled its segregability obligation.  \nIV. \nFor these reasons,  the Court  will grant  in part and deny in part both motions.  A \nseparate order will issue.  \n \n_____________________________   \nDated: August 25, 2022     TREVOR N. M cFADDEN, U.S.D.J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Aleksandr Arapov and Kseniia Arapova, Russian nationals, filed a lawsuit against U.S. officials Marco Rubio and Robert Jachim, seeking a final decision on their EB-1A visa application, which was stalled in \"administrative processing.\" The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, disagreeing with their argument that there was no duty to act further on the visa application and that the doctrine of consular non-reviewability applied. The case involves artificial intelligence as Mr. Arapov's expertise includes automation of technological processes and the use of AI in mechatronic systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the defendants have a clear, non-discretionary duty to render a final decision on the visa application and whether the consular non-reviewability doctrine bars judicial review of the case.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that there is a duty to make a final decision on the visa application and that the doctrine of consular non-reviewability does not bar judicial review in this context. Therefore, the plaintiffs' claims can proceed because the interim 221(g) refusal and pending administrative processing do not constitute a final decision.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you applied for a special visa because you're really good at using robots and AI, but the people in charge keep telling you \"we're thinking about it\" without giving a final yes or no. You ask a judge to make them give you a straight answer. The judge says, “Yes, they have to tell you their final decision, and I can check to make sure they do their job.” The judge didn’t decide if they waited too long yet—that’s for another day.",

Their  application  has been suspended in \n“administrative processing” since July 2023. Through their claims, Plaintiffs allege that \nDefendants have unreasonably delayed and unlawfully withheld a final determination on their visa \napplication , and they seek  relief  under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 8 U.S.C. §§ \n555(b), 706, and the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C . § 1361. Defendants  move to dismiss , arguing that \nPlaintiffs’ claims fail because: (1) they do not identify a clear, non- discretionary duty that \nDefendants have failed to carry out , and (2) the doctrine of consular non -reviewability bars their  \nclaims. Disagreeing on both fronts, the Court DENIES  Defendants’ motion (ECF No. 10).  \n \n \n1 In his official capacity as Secretary of State, Marco Rubio was automatically substituted into this matter \nfor his predecessor Antony J. Blinken pursuant to  Fed R. Civ. P. 25(d).  Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 1 of 12 2 RELEVANT STATUTORY FRAMEWORK  \nThe Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) , 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101, et seq ., allows the State \nDepartment  to issue immigration visas to individuals based on different classifications, including \nemployment -based classifications . See 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b). One such category of visa , the EB-1A, \nis available to individuals of “extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or \nathletics through sustained national or international acclaim [.]” 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(1)(A ). \nSometimes referred to as the “Einstein ” or “genius”  visa, see Amin v. Mayorkas , 24 F.4th 383, \n386–87 (5th Cir. 2022), the EB -1A visa is considered a “priority” immigrant visa  reserved for \nindividuals at “the very top of [their] field[ ,]” 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(2), who seek “to enter the United \nStates to continue work in [their] area of extraordinary ability[.]” 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(1)(A)(ii).  \nTo obtain an EB -1A visa, a petitioner  must first file a Form I -140 with the U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services (“USCIS”)  and provide evidence that they have “sustained national or \ninternational acclaim and that [their] achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise .” \n8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3). This evidence can include “a one -time achievement (that is, a major, \ninternational recognized award)”—such as an Olympic gold medal or Nobel Prize , Amin , 24 F.4th \nat 387—or can otherwise be satisfied  by an applicant meeting at least three of ten criteria \nenumerated in the applicable regulations . See 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)  (specifying the contours of \nthe EB -1A visa, its requirements, and the types of evidence necessary to demonstrate eligibility). \nUnlike some other visa categories, a petitioner’s qualification for an EB -1A visa is not contingent \non a specific offer of employment within the United States , so long as the petitioner establish es \nthat they intend to “continue work[ing] in the area of expertise”  upon entry. 8 C.F.R § 204.5(h)(5).  \nAfter USCIS approves a  Form I -140, USCIS forwards the petition to the National Visa \nCenter (“NVC”) . See 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(n) (1). At that point, a petitioner  must  submit an online Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 2 of 12 3 Immigrant Visa Application (“ Form DS-260”)  to the NVC, which then schedules the applicant for \nan interview at a nearby U.S. embassy or consulate. See 22 C.F.R. §§ 42.61–62.  \nFollowing that interview, the consular officer is responsible for reviewing and rendering a \ndecision on the visa application—either by issuing a visa, refusing the visa , or deciding to \n“discontinue granting” the visa. 8 U.S.C. § 1202(b) (“All immigrant visa applications shall be \nreviewed and adjudicated by a consular officer.”);  22 C.F.R. § 42.81(a)  (“[T]he consular officer \nmust issue the visa, refuse the visa …  or … discontinue granting the visa.”). In doing so, the  \nconsular  officer “shall determine on the  basis of the applicant ’s representations and the visa \napplication and other relevant documentation” whether the applicant has a “proper immigrant \nclassification, if any,” and whether they are “eligib[le] to receive a visa.” 22 C.F.R. § 42.62(b)(1). If, for instance, the consular officer finds the existing information “is inadequate to determine” the \napplicant’s visa eligibility, they may ask the applicant to provide additional documentation. Id.  § \n42.63(c). In that circumstance, the consular officer issues what is technically termed  a “refusal” \nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1201(g)\n2 and then places  the matter into “administrative processing.” See  id.  \n \nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n The Court draws the following facts, accepted as true, from Plaintiffs’ operative \ncomplaint . Am. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. FDIC , 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (quoting Thomas v. \nPrincipi , 394 F.3d 970, 972 (D.C. Cir. 2005)).  \nPlaintiffs Aleksandr Arapov and his wife, Kseniia Arapova, are Russian nationals. ( ECF \nNo. 7 (“Am. Compl.”) ¶¶ 13–14.) They seek  immigrant visas under the EB -1A category. (See id.) \nMr. Arapov is a “ mechatronics  professional ” with “expertise in automation of technological \n \n2 Because this step occurs under  Section 221(g) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1201(g), it is sometimes shorthanded \nas a “221(g) refusal.”  See, e.g., Fetanat v. Rubio, 2025 WL 2643487, at *2, n.2 (D.D.C. Sept. 15, 2025) . Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 3 of 12 4 processes and control in technical systems [,]” as well as a “published researcher on the topics of \ninnovative software for training in mechatronics” and “artificial intelligence as the basis for \nformation in mechatronic systems.” ( Id. ¶¶ 46–47 .)3 He is a past recipient of major awards in \nmechatronics, including “the Medallion for Excellence at the WorldSkills Global Championship and [ second ] place at the Euroskills European Championship.” ( Id. ¶ 48 .) \nOn December 29, 2022, USCIS approved Mr. Arapov’s Form I -140 and forwarded the \npetition to the NVC. ( Am. Compl. ¶ 49 .) Three months later, on March 20, 2023, Mr. Arapov \nsubmitted a Form DS -260 for himself and his wife. ( Id. ¶ 51  (noting that Ms. Arapova is included \nin the application as a “derivative benefici ary”) .) On July 26, 2023, they  attended their visa \ninterview at the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw, Poland. At the end of the interview, the consular officer \nadvised  that their application  would require further administrative processing and issued a refusal \nunder  8 U.S.C. § 1201(g) . (Id. ¶ 53.) The consular officer then gave Plaintiffs a notice that read : \n“We will contact you when processing is complete d.” ( Id. ¶ 54.) The very next day, Plaintiffs  \nsubmitted the ad ditional information requested for administrative processing. ( Id. ¶ 55.)  \nAt the time Plaintiffs filed this action in October 2024 —approximately 15 months after \ntheir interview and the  221(g) refusal —the State Department ’s Consular Electronic Application \nCenter (“CEAC ”) Visa Status Check website  indicated  that Plaintiffs’ application status was still  \n“[r]efused.” ( Id. ¶ 56.) The website advises  “those who were ‘refused for administrative processing \n[that their] case will remain refused while undergoing such processing[,]’ ” that they “will receive \nanother adjudication once such processing is complete [,]” and  that they  “will be contacted if \n \n3 Neither Plaintiffs’ Complaint nor their briefing really explains the field of mechatronics. Based on the \nCourt’s research, mechatronics is described as a complex, “multidisciplinary science” aimed at the \n“synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics, and control theory within product design and \nmanufacturing.” Michael F. Zaeh & Robert Gao , Mechatronics , in CIRP E NCYCLOPEDIA OF PRODUCTION \nENGINEERING  (Mar. 13, 2018) , online at https://perma.cc/49S2 -L8HF . Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 4 of 12 5 additional information is needed.” ( Id.; see also ECF No. 7- 3, CEAC Online Case Status.) \nPlaintiffs allege they have made “numerous inquiries” and undertaken “all reasonable attempts … \nto determine the nature of the delay [,]” but to no avail. (Am. Compl. ¶ 58.)  \nAs of this  ruling—now approximately 26 months after Plaintiffs’ consular interview and \nthe 221(g) refusal —Plaintiffs’  application  remain s pending with no final decision.  \n \nLEGAL STANDARDS  \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), a party may seek dismissal on the \ngrounds that the court lacks subject -matter jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). A motion brought \nunder Rule 12(b)(1) “presents a threshold challenge to the court ’s jurisdiction.” Haase v. Sessions , \n835 F.2d 902, 906 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The  plaintiff  “bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction by \na preponderance of the evidence.” Bagherian v. Pompeo, 442 F. Supp. 3d 87, 91–92 (D.D.C. 2020)  \n(citation omitted) . But courts  must “accept the well -pleaded factual allegations as true and draw \nall reasonable inferences from those allegations in the Plaintiffs’  favor.” Kareem v. Haspel , 986 \nF.3d 859, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (quoting Arpaio v. Obama , 797 F.3d 11, 19 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), courts should dismiss a complaint that \nfails to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678  \n(2009)  (citation omitted) . Under Rule 12(b)(6), a  court  “assumes the truth of all well -pleaded \nfactual allegations in the complaint and construes reasonable inferences from those allegations in the plaintiff’s favor.” Sissel v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 760 F.3d 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2014) . \nThat said, “ threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory \nstatements,” cannot forestall  a motion to dismiss.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  \n Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 5 of 12 6 DISCUSSION  \nAs indicated, Defendants press two arguments for dismissal under Rules 12(b)(1) and \n12(b)(6) .4 First, Defendants  argue  that Plaintiffs’  claims fail because there is no clear and discrete  \nduty that obligates  further adjudication of their  visa application after it was initially “refused” \nunder Section 221(g) and placed into administrative processing. (ECF No. 10 (“ Defs.’ Mem. ”) at \n10–14.)5 Second, Defendants  insist  the doctrine of consular non-reviewability bars judicial review  \nhere. ( Id. at 15–18.)  On both fronts, Defendants rely heavily on an unpublished, per curiam  \ndecision from the D.C. Circuit:  Karimova v. Abate , 2024 WL 3517852 (D.C. Cir. July 24, 2024) .  \nIn engaging with these points , this Court is hardly wading into uncharted waters. Our \nDistrict has seen —and continues to see —a deluge of cases challenging similar  delays on other \nvisa applications that have languished in Section 221(g) refusal purgatory. Those lawsuits have \ngenerated  scores of rulings from judges across the courthouse  with varying results. As such, this  \nCourt writes with the benefit of its colleagues’ thoughtful views  on these same subjects, and it \nborrows from those decisions  in substantial part. Si mply put , this Court agree s with the myriad \ncases rejecting  Defendants’ same theories for dismissal and concluding that Karimova is a \nnonbinding ruling that this Court need not —and does not —follow here.  \n \n4 Defendants never really parse out which arguments they bring— or which claims they attack —under Rule \n12(b)(1) versus Rule 12(b)(6) , leaving that task to the Court, it seems. For purposes of Plaintiffs’ Mandamus \nAct claim, the “three threshold requirements are jurisdictional,” including the need to show “a clear duty to \nact,” which would implicate Rule 12(b)(1). Am. Hosp. Ass’n v. Burwell , 812 F.3d 183, 189 (D.C. Cir. 2016). \nBut the parallel argument as to Plaintiffs’ APA claim addresses only whether they have stated a claim for \nrelief, not a basis for jurisdiction, which means the issue is analyzed under Rule 12(b)(6). See Sierra Club \nv. Jackson , 648 F.3d 848, 854 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Finally,  the doctrine of consular non- reviewability is “not \na jurisdictional defense,” Janay v. Blinken , 743 F. Supp. 3d 96, 113 (D.D.C. 2024), and thus reviewed under \nRule 12(b)(6). Ul timately, regardless of which Rule 12 lens the Court uses to scrutinize Defendants’ \ndismissal arguments, it would reach the same result.    \n5 Citations to the parties’ briefs are to the  page numbers assigned by the electronic case- filing system.  Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 6 of 12 7 I. Defendants  Have A Discrete,  Non -Discretionary Duty To Render A Final Decision  \nPlaintiffs’ claims sound under the APA and the Mandamus Act. The APA provides that a \n“reviewing court shall … compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(1). Such a claim “can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.” Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 55 (2004); Da Costa v. Immigr. Inv. Program Off., 80 F.4th 330, 340 (D.C. Cir. 2023). \nSimilarly, for purposes of  their mandamus claim, Plaintiffs must show that Defendants are \n“violating a clear duty to act,” among other factors . Am. Hosp. Ass’n, 812 F.3d at  189. Under both \ntheories, then, Plaintiffs’ claims are viable only if premised on Defendants’ alleged failure to carry \nout a discrete, clear, and non- discretionary duty to act.  \nDefendants say t hat Plaintiffs’ claims fail on this basis because there is no such “duty to \nact further” on Plaintiffs’ application. (Def s.’ Mem. at 15.) According to Defendants, “after a \nconsular officer refuses a visa application under Section 221(g) … there is no further statutory or \nregulatory command to act [.]” (Id. at 7.) Joining plenty of good company, this Court disagrees.  \n As many  judges in this District have concluded, “[i]ssuing a final decision on a visa \napplication is plainly a discrete agency action, and it is required by both the APA and federal regulations.” Kahbasi v. Blinken, 2024 WL 3202222, at *5 (D.D.C. June 27, 2024)  (AliKhan, J.) ; \nsee also Fetanat v. Rubio, 2025 WL 2643487, at *2–3 (D.D.C. Sept. 15, 2025) (Ali, J.);  \nTolymbekova v. Rubio, 2025 WL 2576312, at *5 (D.D.C. Sept. 5, 2025)  (Faruqui, M.J.) ; \nAramnahad v. Rubio, 2025 WL 973483, at *8–10 (D.D.C. Mar. 31, 2025)  (Upadhyaya, M.J.) ; \nMotevali v. Rubio, 2025 WL 885116, at *5–6 (D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2025) (Sooknanan, J.);  Fakhimi v. \nDep’t of State , 2023 WL 6976073, at *6 (D.D.C. Oct. 23, 2023)  (Kollar -Kotelly, J.) ; Khazaei v. Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 7 of 12 8 Blinken , 2023 WL 6065095, at *6 (D.D.C. Sept. 18, 2023)  (Boasberg, J.) .6 Generally speaking, \nthose co urts have  grounded this determination in the APA itself —namely, 5 U.S.C. §§ 555(b) and \n706(1) —as well as the INA and its implementing regulations, including 22 C.F.R. § 42.81(a) \n(providing that “the consular officer must issue the visa,” “refuse the visa,” or “discontinue \ngranting the visa”). And those courts have rejected the notion that a 221(g) refusal —and the  \nconcomitant placement of an application into “administrative processing”  limbo —suffice s to \ncomplete that duty . While the agency “may ‘choose to characterize’ a consular officer’s decision \nto place an application in administrative processing as a final refusal … ‘that magic word is not a \nget-out-of-review -free card.’” Aramnahad, 2025 WL 973483, at *9 (quoting Al -Gharawy v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 617 F. Supp. 3d 1, 16 (D.D.C. 2022)); Fetanat , 2025 WL 2643487, at *3. \nJudge Sooknanan recently  summed up the practical reality  here quite well:  \nWhen  a consular officer decides to refuse a visa- applicant ’s application for \nadministrative processing, the officer has  certainly made a decision about the \napplication: that the  applicant should not yet receive the visa and that more  \nprocessing is required. But  … the Department of State has  not yet made the  decision \nabout their applications —the determination that puts their applications to rest …  \n[Plaintiffs ] never received the all-important yes -or-no decision from the reviewing \nofficer about the benefit th ey sought to obta in. \nThein v. Trump, 2025 WL 2418402, at *9 (D.D.C. Aug. 21, 2025) (emphases in original); see also Janay v. Blinken , 743 F. Supp. 3d 96, 112  (D.D.C. 2024)  (“In other words, the application is still  \nbeing processed and a decision is still forthcoming. It has  only been ‘refused’ in the far -from -literal \n \n6 Other judges in this District have assumed  without deciding that a predicate duty exists . See, e.g., \nRashidian v. Garland, 2024 WL 1076810, at *5 (D.D.C. Mar. 8, 2024) (Reyes, J.) (emphasizing that \nDefendants’ argument has “met with a frosty reception … in this District” but proceeding to dismiss the \ncase on other grounds, assuming that such a duty exists ). Otherwise, some  judges —based on the Court’s \nresearch —have reached the opposite conclusion and sided with Defendants  on this issue , i.e., holding that \nonce a 221(g) refusal issues, there is no remaining  clear, discrete, and non -discretionary duty to compel. \nSee, e.g., Seifan v. Sweeney , 2025 WL 2171093, at *4–6 (D.D.C. July 31, 2025) (Contreras, J.); Rahiminejad \nv. Rubio, 2025 WL 2144092, at *2– 4 (D.D.C. July 29, 2025) (Cooper, J.);  Esmaeilzadeh v. Rubio, 2025 \nWL 1865159, at *5–11 (D.D.C. July 7, 2025) (Harvey, M.J.); Yaghoubnezhad v. Stufft , 734 F. Supp. 3d 87, \n99–103 (D.D.C. 2024) (McFadden, J.).  As explained, though, the Court takes the contrary view and aligns \ninstead with those cases above that have acknowledged such a duty in this context.  Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 8 of 12 9 sense that it has  not yet been ‘granted’ or ‘denied.’ ”). The Court agrees with this  “majority view [,]” \nKahbasi , 2024 WL 3202222, at *5, and rejects Defendants’ first argument for dismissal. \n In resisting this outcome, Defendants rely almost exclusively on the D.C. Circuit’s decision \nin Karimova. They go so far as to insist that “Karimova is dispositive of the claims presented in \nthis case.” (Def s.’ Mem. at 15.) But by its own terms, Karimova cannot bear the weight Defendants  \nwould place on it. After all, as Defendants acknowledge ( albeit in a footnote), Karimova “ is an \nunpublished opinion of the D.C. Circuit.” ( Id. at 11 n.3.) And under the D.C. Circuit Rules, “while \nunpublished dispositions m ay be cited  to the court … a panel ’s decision to issue an unpublished \ndisposition means  that the panel sees no precedential value in that disposition.”  D.C. Cir. Rule \n36(e)(2) (emphasis adde d). This Court “takes the D.C. Circuit at its word [,]” Shushkov  v. Rubio, \n2025 WL 2389939, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 18, 2025), and will not afford  dispositive weight to \nKarimova. Instead, it  agrees with the prevailing view that “Karimova is not binding.”  Aramnahad, \n2025 WL 973483, at *6 ; see also, e.g., Fetanat , 2025 WL 2643487, at *4;  Thein, 2025 WL \n2418402, at *8; Shushkov , 2025 WL 2389939, at *3–4; Tolymbekova , 2025 WL 2576312, at *4; \nAkter v. Flook, 2025 WL 661296, at *2 n.1 (D.D.C. Feb. 28, 2025) .  \nFurther , for many of the same reasons explained in those same cases and others, the  Court \ndoes not find Karimova’s rationale persuasive here either . For one thing, Karimova focused \nexclusively on “Section 555(b) of the APA as the source of the consular officer’s  alleged  duty to \nact[,]” Karimova, 2024 WL 3517852, at *3, whereas Plaintiffs have grounded their claims here i n \nSection 706 of the APA, as well as various provisions of the INA and the statute’s  implementing \nregulations. “ Karimova did not consider these sources.” Haeri Mehneh v. Blinken , 2024 WL \n5116521, at *6 (D.D.C. Dec. 16, 2024);  see also Aramnahad, 2025 WL 973483, at *8 \n(distinguishing Karimova on this basis and collecting cases doing the same). More , the underlying Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 9 of 12 10 factual allegations set this case apart. The plaintiff in Karimova acknowledged that her application \nhad been “officially refused ,” which meant the D.C. Circuit interpreted the claim as one asking the \ngovernment to “re -adjudicat e [an] already -refused application [.]” Fetanat , 2025 WL 2643487, at \n*3 (citing Karimova, 2024 WL 3517852, at *3) ; see also  Shushkov , 2025 WL 2389939, at *4. \nPlaintiffs ’ allegations here are quite  different.  They assert  that Defendants continue to withhold \nfinal, official action on their visa application —whether final approval or final refusal —and \nmaintain that th e interim 221(g) refusal falls short. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6, 9, 56–58, 72–73.)  Indeed, \nas Plaintiffs allege, the State  Department ’s own website advises that although their “ case will \nremain refused while undergoing [administrative]  processing [,]” they “ will receive another \nadjudication once such processing is complete [.]” (Id. ¶ 56; ECF No. 7- 3, CEAC Online Case \nStatus.)  And m ore still, the Court believes Karimova placed far “too little emphasis on … the \nrealities of the visa -adjudication process [,]” Shushkov , 2024 WL 2389939, at *4, and “what is \nactually happening”  in a practical and real -world sense , Thein , 2025 WL 2418402, at *10.  \nIn short, the Court finds  that Plaintiffs’ claims are premised on a clear, discrete, and non -\ndiscretionary duty to act, and it rejects Defendants’ argument to the contrary.  \nII. The Consular Non -Reviewability  Doctrine Does Not Apply  \nDefendants’ alternative argument for dismissal rests on  the doctrine of consular non-\nreviewability. (Defs. ’ Mem. at 15–18.) This doctrine “shields a consular officer ’s decision to issue \nor withhold a visa from judicial review , at least unless Congress says otherwise.”  Baan Ra o Thai \nRestaurant v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d 1020, 1024 (D.C. Cir. 2021) . As Defendants tell it, Plaintiffs’ \nclaims run headlong into the  doctrine because a “consular officer has decided to withhold issuing \na visa” —a decision they say is “not reviewable and ends th is matter.” (Defs.’ Mem. at 17.)  Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 10 of 12 11 But as the discussion above  makes  clear, Defendants have not truly made that decision , \ncertainly not in any final sense. This means  Plaintiffs are not asking for judicial review of the \nsubstance  of any final decision to grant or deny a  visa; they  just want a conclusive answer one way \nor the other . And it  is the substantive decision—and the surrounding policy judgments of the \npolitical branches —that the doctrine aims to protect. Baan Rao, 985 F.3d at 1024 ( “Decisions \nregarding the admission and exclusion of noncitizens may implicate relations with foreign powers \nor involve classifications defined in the light of changing political and e conomic circumstances,” \nmaking “such judgments … more appropriate to either the Legislature or the Executive.”)  (cleaned \nup); Nine Iraqi Allies Under Serious Threat Because of Their Faithful Serv. to the United States  v. \nKerry , 168 F. Supp. 3d 268, 290–91 (D.D.C. 2016)  (“When the Government simply declines to \nprovide a decision in the manner provided by Congress, it is not exercising its prerogative to grant or deny applications but failing to act at al l.”). For these reasons, judges in  this District have \noverwhelmingly  agreed that the doctrine of consular non- reviewability is not implica ted on these \nfacts . Fetanat , 2025 WL 2643487, at *4; Thein , 2025 WL 2418402, at *7–10; Tolymbekova , 2025 \nWL 2576312, at *3–4; Shushkov , 2025 WL 2389939, at *4–5;  Aramnahad, 2025 WL 973483, at \n*10; Fakhimi , 2023 WL 6976073, at *4; Didban v. Pompeo, 435 F. Supp. 3d 168, 174 (D.D.C. \n2020); Vulupala v. Barr , 438 F. Supp. 3d 93, 98– 99 (D.D.C. 2020). To borrow Judge AliKhan’s \nwords  on the subject , Plaintiffs’  suit “ is properly understood as an attempt to compel an \nadjudication that has been unreasonably delayed, rather than one aimed at changing a final decision that has already been rendered. ” Shushkov , 2025 WL 2389939, at *5.  \nKarimova does not help Defendants on this point either. The Court does not find Karimova \nbinding or even persuasive for the reasons explained. And on top of that , Karimova expressly \ndeclined to even reach  the issue  of consular non- reviewability . Karimova, 2024 WL 3517852, at Case 1:24-cv-03013-MJS     Document 14     Filed 09/25/25     Page 11 of 12 12 *6 (“[W]e need not decide whether that principle of nonreviewability applies in this case, which \npurports to challenge the timing rather than content of a consular visa decision[.]”).  \nAs in so many other cases, then, this Court holds that the doctrine of consular non -\nreviewability does not bar Plaintiffs’ claims here.  \n* * * \nBecause it disagrees with Defendants’ two arguments for dismissal, the Court’s analysis \nends there. Defendants expressly—and strategically, it seems —made the affirmative decision to \nnot seek dismissal based on an argument that Plaintiffs have not alleged unreasonable delay under the so -called TRAC  factors. See Telecomms . Rsch. & Action Ctr.v. F.C.C.  (“TRAC”) , 750 F.2d 70, \n79–80 (D.C. Cir. 1984). Instead, Defendants suggested they would separately move for judgment \non the pleadings on that  basis, if necessar y. (Defs.’ Mem. at 7 n.2.) Given that, and because \nPlaintiffs likewise implore the Court to defer any merits -focused analysis as to whether the delay \nhere is unreasonable (Pls.’ Mem. at 38–40), the Court leaves that issue for another day.  \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES  Defendants’ motion to dismiss . The Court \nwill issue a separate order so stating.  \n  \n \nDated:   \nSeptember 25, 2025     \n   MATTHEW J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Francis Palardy v. AT&T Services, Inc., et al., the court dismissed claims against the staffing agency Experis for employment discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. The court found Palardy's complaint lacking specific allegations against Experis and failed to demonstrate the company's involvement in the alleged discrimination or failure to accommodate his hearing disability. The case does not involve artificial intelligence, machine learning, or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Experis, as a staffing agency, discriminatorily terminated or failed to accommodate Palardy's disability under the ADA and related laws.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Palardy failed to state a claim against Experis, as his complaint did not establish the agency's role in the alleged discrimination or failure to accommodate. As a result, the claims against Experis were dismissed with prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Francis Palardy accused a company called Experis of discriminating against him because of his hearing disability and not helping him by providing the accommodations he needed. To win this kind of case, he needed to show how Experis was responsible. But the court looked at the details and couldn't find enough evidence to support Palardy's claims against Experis, so they dismissed this part of his case permanently.",
    "full_text": "1 \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS  \nSHERMAN DIVISION  \n \nFRANCIS PALARDY  \n \nv. \n \nAT&T SERVICES,  INC.,  ET AL.  § \n§ \n§ \n§ § \n  \n \nCIVIL NO. 4:21 -CV-626-SDJ \n \nMEMORANDUM ADOPTING REPORT AND \nRECOMMENDATION OF UNITED STATES \nMAGISTRATE JUDGE  \n This employment discrimination  case arises from Plaintiff Francis Palardy ’s \ntermination from a temporary work assignment. In support of his claims under the \nAmericans with Disabilities  Act and Rehabilitation Act , Palardy alleges almost no \nfacts directed  toward Defen dant Experis US, Inc.  (“Experis”)  specifically. It follows \nthat Palardy has failed to state a claim against the  company  upon which relief can be \ngranted . The Court therefore adopts the Magistrate Judge’s Report and \nRecommendation, (Dkt . #71), overrules Palardy’s objections, (Dkt.  #75), and \ndismisses the claims against Experis  with prejudice.    \nI. BACKGROUND  \n Palardy alleges  that the Defendants discriminated against him based on a \nsevere hearing disability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act  (“ADA”)  \nand Rehabilitation Act .1 (Dkt.  #46 ¶¶ 1, 67– 73) (citing 42 U.S.C. §  12101 et seq. ). But \n \n 1 Palardy asserts claims under the Rehabilitation Act , (Dkt.  #46 ¶ ¶ 1, 74– 77) (citing \n29 U.S.C. §  794), and what he refers to as a “pendant claim ” under  the Texas Commission on \nHuman Rights Act. (Dkt. #46 ¶ 1) (citing TEX. LABOR CODE § 21.001 et seq. ). The \nRehabilitation Act claims are directed toward Defendants  AT&T Service, Inc., and \nInternational Business Machines Corporation only—not Experis —on the ground that those \nDefendants have  received sufficient government funding  to be covered under the Act’s Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 1 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n Palardy provides few allegations directed toward Experis specifically —as opposed to \nthe other Defendants. He does not allege, for example, any facts explaining his \nrelationship with Experis (except that Experis emailed him about certain job \nopportunities), any facts suggesting that Experis had control or authority over the \nemployers who allegedly terminated him,  or any facts suggesting that Experis had \nthe ability to provide a reasonable accommodation for his disability and neglected to \ndo so.  It is not immediately clear from reviewing  the amended complaint what kind \nof company Experis  even is—though from the parties’ briefing,  it appears that \nExperis is a staffing agency that recruits technology professionals for Defendants  \nAT&T Services, Inc.,  (“AT&T”) and  International Business Machines Corporation \n(“IBM”) , among other companies. (Dkt.  #48-1 at 3 n.1) ; (Dkt.  #51 at  2–5). \n The amended complaint allege s only  that Experis conducted some kind of \ninvestigation into whether AT&T and IBM terminated Palardy based on his severe hearing disability or failed to provide him reasonable accommodations. (Dkt. #46 ¶ 63). But the timing and nature of that investigation is  unclear. According \nto the amended complaint, Experis ultimately concluded that no discrimination had occurred and continued to contact Palardy about new job opportunities as they became available.  (Dkt. #46 at 63) . In addition to the investigation, the amended \ncomplaint also alleges that , after Palardy completed some kind of programming test \n \nprohibition against federal discrimination. (Dkt.  #46 ¶¶  74–77). The Texas Commission on \nHuman Rights Act claim is governed under the same standards as the ADA  claims . Clark  v. \nCharter Commc’ns, L.L.C. , 775 F.App’x 764, 767 & n.10 (5th Cir. 2019); Cruz  v. R2Sonic, \nLLC, 405 F.Supp.3d 676, 686 (W.D. Tex. 2019) (“[C]ourts apply the same standards to \ndisability discrimination, retaliation, and failure -to-accommodate claims brought under both \n[the ADA and Texas Commission on Human Rights Act].”).  Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 2 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n with IBM (presumably as part of a  job application  process) , he informed Experis that \nhe would need accommodations for future tests. (Dkt.  #46 at 20). Palardy does not \nallege that he failed the programming test or that he suffered any consequences from \na lack of reasonable accommodations.  \n The Report concluded  that Palardy’s claims against Experis should be \ndismissed. (Dkt. #71). And because  Palardy had  already been provided  an \nopportunity to amend his complaint, the Report recommended  a dismissal with \nprejudice, as opposed to a dismissal with leave to amend. (Dkt.  #71 at 13 n.5). Palardy \nobjected to the Report.  (Dkt.  #75). \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n The Court reviews a magistrate judge’s report and recommendation de novo \nfollowing a timely objection. 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). The objecting party must \nspecifically identify the magistrate judge’s findings to which he objects. Id. When the \nobjecting party offers frivolous, general, or conclusory objections, the Court may disregard those objections. Nettles v. Wainright , 677 F.2d 404, 410 & n.8 (5th Cir. \n1982) (en banc), overruled on other grounds by  Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n , \n79 F.3d 1415 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc).  \n Similarly, the Court need not address objections at length when they simply \n“rehash” or “mirror” arguments that were already addressed in the report and \nrecommendation. See Mark v. Spears , No. 6:18- CV-309, 2022 WL 363586, at *1 \n(E.D.  Tex. Feb. 7, 2022); see also  Nickelson v. Warden, No. 1:11- CV-334, 2012 WL \n700827, at *4 (S.D.  Ohio Mar. 1, 2012) (“[O]bjections to magistrate judges’ reports Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 3 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n and recommendations are not meant to be simply a vehicle to rehash arguments set \nforth in the petition.”).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n Palardy has not pleaded  any facts explaining Experis’s role in the alleged \ndiscrimination against him. It follows  that Palardy has failed to state a claim against \nthe company under the ADA, his objections to the contrary notwithstanding.  The \nCourt also finds that , because Palardy was provided ample opportunity to correct \nthese deficiencies , the amended complaint should be dismissed with out leave to \namend.  \nA. The Amended Complaint Fails to State a Claim Against Experis Under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act.  \n At the outset , the Court finds that Palardy has failed to state an employment \ndiscrimination claim against Experis under the Americans with Disabilities Act. That \nis true no matter the theory alleged: wrongful termination, failure to accommodate, \nimproper examinations, or any other theory that can be discerned in the amended \ncomplaint.  \n Palardy cannot prevail under any of  these theories without demonstrating \nExperis’s role in the alleged discrimination against him. Assuming that Experis is a \nstaffing agency, as the parties’ briefing indicates,2 it can be held responsible for a \n \n 2 If Experis is not a staffing agency, that confusion underscore s the amended \ncomplaint’s failure to articulate a “short and plain statement of the claim [s]” asserted against \nExperis. FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2); s ee also Vanderbol  v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., No. 4:19-\nCV-119-SDJ, 2020 WL 6866393, at *3 (E.D. Tex. Nov.  23, 2020) (collecting cases for the \nproposition that a complaint may be dismissed when it is unwieldy or unintelligible), aff’d , \nNo. 20-40875, 2021 WL 2577611 (5th Cir. Mar.  1, 2021).

Burton  v. Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. , 798 F.3d 222, \n229 (5th Cir. 2015); High  v. City of Wylie , No. 4:18- CV-364, 2019 WL 3557238, at  *5 \n(E.D.  Tex. Aug.  5, 2019) ; see generally  U.S.  EQUAL EMP’T OPPORTUNITY COMM ’N, \nENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE : APPLICATION OF THE ADA  TO CONTINGENT WORKERS PLACED BY \nTEMPORARY AGENCIES AND OTHER STAFFING FIRMS , 2000 WL 33407189 (2000) .3 \ni. Wrongful T ermination  \n The amended complaint does not state a claim against Experis under a \nwrongful termination theory. To state a claim for wrongful termination or for any \nother adverse employment action under the ADA, the plaintiff must establish the \n \n 3 In deciding whether a staffing agency constitutes a joint employer, courts consider \ntwo broad factors: the agency’s “control” over the plaintiff and the “economic realities of the \nrelationship.”  See Burton , 798 F.3d at  227– 28 (applying the “hybrid economic \nrealities/common law control test” to determine whether defendants were joint employers under the ADA (quotations omitted)). Between these factors, control is the more important—\nit concerns the agency’s ability to hire , terminate, supervise, or set schedules for the plaintiff. \nDeal v. State Farm Cty. Mut. Ins. Co. of Tex. , 5 F.3d 117, 119 (5th Cir. 1993). The economic \nrealities of the relationship, however, concerns the agency’s ability to pay the plaintiff’s salary, withhold taxes, provide benefits, and set the terms and conditions of the employment. \nId.  \n Even when a staffing agency does not qualify as a joint employer, some authorities \nsuggest that it can still be held responsible for discrimination under the ADA under certain \ncircumstances —such as when the agency interfered with the plaintiff’s ADA rights and when \nit qualifies as an “employment agency.” U.S.\n EQUAL EMP’T OPPORTUNITY COMM ’N, \nENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE : APPLICATION OF THE ADA  TO CONTINGENT WORKERS PLACED BY \nTEMPORARY AGENCIES AND OTHER STAFFING FIRMS , 2000 WL 33407189, at *2 (2000). The \nCourt need not address those possibilities here, however, because—no matter Palardy’s \nrelationship with Experis —he has not alleged that Experis contributed to the alleged \ndiscrimination against him as would be required  to support a disability discrimination claim \nagainst the company.  \n Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 5 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n following elements: (1) that he has a disability; (2) that he was qualified for the job \nhe had or the job he applied for; and (3) that he was subject to an adverse employment decision because of his disability . EEOC v. LHC Grp., Inc. , 773 F.3d 688, 697 (5th Cir. \n2014).   \n The third element is the sticking point in this case. It can be satisfied against \na staffing agency not only when the agency participates in the adverse employment \ndecision, but also when the agency fails to take prompt corrective measures within  \nits control  to address the adverse employment decision . Burton , 798 F.3d at 229.  \nDepending on the circumstances of the case, prompt corrective measures could include:\n4 (1) making the client aware of the misconduct; (2) asserting the staffing \nfirm’s commitment to protect its workers from harassment and discrimination; (3) insisting on prompt investigation and corrective measures;  or (4) offering the worker \nan alternative job assignment at the same pay rate. U.S.\n EQUAL EMP. OPPORTUNITY \nCOMM ’N, ENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE : APPLICATION OF EEO  LAWS TO CONTINGENT \nWORKERS PLACED BY TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES AND OTHER STAFFING \nFIRMS , 1997 WL 33159161, at *11.5 \n \n4 Although not delineated among the specific corrective measures a staffing agency \ncan take, refusing to do business with a client that violates anti -discrimination and \nharassment laws could also be a necessary corrective measure for the staffing agency to avoid \nliability. U.S.  EQUAL EMP. OPPORTUNITY COMM ’N, ENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE : APPLICATION \nOF EEO LAWS TO CONTINGENT WORKERS PLACED BY TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES \nAND OTHER STAFFING FIRMS , 1997 WL 33159161, at *11. The EEOC guidance provides that \nif the staffing agency knows of a complaint against a client, it is not sufficient to merely \ninform the client of the complaint. Id. The staffing agency should also “decline to assign any \nother workers until the client [ undert akes]  the necessary corrective and preventative \nmeasures.” Id. \n5 Federal courts often consult the EEOC compliance guidelines when interpreting the \nADA. See Burton , 798 F.3d at  228 (“ We have repeatedly consulted the EEOC Compliance \nManual when interpreting the ADA.” ). Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 6 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n  As explained in the Report, Palardy has offered  no facts demonstrating that \nExperis participated in any alleged wrongful termination , adverse employment \ndecision , or failed to take corrective measures in its control. It is not clear to what \nextent Experis was even on notice of the circumstances surrounding the alleged \nwrongful termination , except that Experis allegedly learned of “concerning ,” \n(Dkt. #46 ¶ 63), statements made by an AT&T  manager , Martin McEnroe,  regarding \nPalardy’s performance and abilities. Instead of ignoring the manager’s statements, \nExperis investigated  them to determine whether “the decision to terminate [Palardy \nwas] based on hearing impairment.” (Dkt. #46  at 63). Experis concluded that no \ndiscrimination had occurred and continued sending  Palardy job opportunities as they \nbecame available. As to what Experis could have done differently to prevent or repair \nthe allegedly wrongful termination based on the information available to it, the \namend ed complaint is silent.  \n The amended complaint’s allegations, therefore, fail to place Experis on notice \nof the claim asserted against it and the ground s on which it rests. Under the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff cannot open the doors to the federal courthouse \nthrough “unadorned, the defendant -unlawfully -harmed -me accusation[s].” Ashcroft  \nv. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 173 L. Ed.2d 868 (2009) . Nor can the \nplaintiff prevail through “naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement.” Id. (quotations and brackets omitted). To the contrary,  courts “retain the power to \ninsist upon some specificity in pleading” before allowing a substantial factual controversy to proceed. Bell Atlantic Corp v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 558, 127 S. Ct. Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 7 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n 1955, 167 L. Ed.2d 929 (2007)  (quoting Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.  v. \nCarpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 528 n.17, 103 S. Ct. 897, 74 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1983)). Here, \nbecause Palardy has not alleged any specific facts supporting a wrongful termination \ntheory against Experis, the Court finds that Palardy has failed to state an ADA claim against Experis under that theory.  \n All of Palardy’s objections supporting a wrongful termination or other adverse  \nemployment action theory either rehash  arguments addressed in the Report or veer \nin irrelevant  directions. For example, Palardy invokes the Supreme C ourt’s decision \nin Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org. , 597 U.S. 215, 142 S. Ct. 2228, 213 L.Ed.2d \n545 (2022) , overtur ning Roe v. Wade , 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 \n(1973) , for the proposition that courts have “a long history of treating disabled people \nbadly” and therefore should uphold the rights extended to disabled people through \nthe ADA, in keeping with Dobbs’\n “[concern] for disabled fetuses .” (Dkt. #75 ¶ 11). He \nalso accuses  the magistrate  judge  of “ignore[ing] issues of national security” and flags \nfor the Court’s attention that Google’s  artificial intelligence technology will  soon \n“become sentient.” (Dkt. #75 ¶ 12). Because these objections do not overcome the \namended complaint’s core deficiency —that it fails to establish Experis’s role in the \nalleged discrimination  against Palardy —the objections are overruled.  \nii. Reasonable Accommodations  \n The amended complaint does not state a claim under a failure -to-accommodate \ntheory either. A failure to accommodate claim has three elements: (1) that the plaintiff was a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that the defendant knew of the plaintiff’s disability  and consequential limitations; and (3) that the defendant Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 8 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n failed to make reasonable accommodations for those limitations. Feist v. La., Dep’t of \nJust., Off. of the Att’y Gen., 730 F.3d 450, 452 (5th  Cir. 2013). The Defendant’s \nresponsibility to provide a reasonable accommodation is not triggered, however, until \nthe plaintiff requests one. LHC Grp., Inc. , 773 F.3d at 699. The request need not be \nformal or even identify a specific requested accommodation. EEOC v. Chevron \nPhillips Chem. Co., LP, 570 F.3d 606, 621 (5th Cir. 2009) ; see also U.S.  EQUAL EMP. \nOPPORTUNITY COMM ’N, ENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE : REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION  AND \nUNDUE HARDSHIP UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, 2002  WL  31994335,  \nat *4 (stating that an employee may make a request for an accommodation in “plain English” and does not have to “mention the ADA or use the phrase ‘reasonable accommodation .’”).\n Instead , the request must alert the defendant to the need for an \naccommodation  and spark the “interactive process of identifying ” what \naccommodation, if any, will address the plaintiff’s limitations.  Cutera v. Bd . of \nSupervisors of La. S tate Univ. , 429 F.3d 108, 113 (5th Cir. 2005). Even when a \nplaintiff is otherwise  entitled to a reasonable  accommodation, the defendant  need not \nprovide one if it would impose an undue hardship.  Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., LP , \n570 F.3d at 614.  \n A staffing firm must provide a reasonable accommodation when it is both \nnotified of the need for the accommodation a s a joint employer client and the ability \nto provide that accommodation is in its control . U.S.  EQUAL EMP. OPPORTUNITY COMM ’N, \nENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE : APPLICATION OF THE ADA TO CONTINGENT WORKERS PLACED BY \nTEMPORARY AGENCIES AND OTHER STAFFING FIRMS , 2000 WL 33407189, at *6– 7. Even \nwhen a staffing firm lacks the ability to provide a reasonable accommodation, it may Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 9 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n be required in some circumstances to inform the joint employer client  of the need for \na reasonable accommodation and take remedial steps should the client refuse to \nprovide it . Id. at *9.  Remedial steps could include  offering the plaintiff the next \navailable position for which he is qualified or refusing to assign additional workers to that client . Id. In some circumstances, an employee may request a reasonable \naccommodation after the need for the accommodation has elapsed.  29 C.F.R. § 1630, \nApp. (2016).  If a plaintiff is unable to complete a test due to vision impairment, for \nexample—and did not know of the need for an accommodation before taking the test —\nthe plaintiff may request the accommodation after the fact. Id. The defendant would \nbe required to honor that request , for example, by allowing the plaintiff to retake the \ntest with enlarged typeface.  Id. \n Here, the amended complaint does not allege that Palar dy requested a  \nreasonable accommodation from Experis , with the sole  exception  that after a \nprogramming test with IBM,  Palardy requested that all tests be done by video \nconferencing. But Palardy has not alleged any details explaining the significance of the programming test at IBM or suggesting that the lack of a  reasonable \naccommodation had any consequences. To the contrary, the programming test appears to  be part of a pre -employment screening  process for a jo b that Palardy  \neventually obtained .\n6  \n \n6 The Interpretive Guidance on Title I of the ADA clarifies that the requirement that \nan employer provide alternative, accessible test formats does not apply to employment tests \nthat “require the use of sensory, manual, or speaking skills” if the purpose of the test is to \nmeasure those skills. 29 C.F.R. § 1630, App. (2016). However, such a test cannot be used to \nexclude someone with a disability unless “ the skill was necessary to perform an essential \nfunction of the position and no reasonable accommodation was available to enable the Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 10 of 13 PageID\n#:  <pageID>11 \n Without any details establishing that Experis denied Palardy a reasonable \naccommodation without which he could not obtain or perform his job responsibilities , \nthe Court finds that Palardy cannot prevail against Experis under a reasonable \naccommodations theory. Palardy  does not offer any objections supporting his \nreasonable  accommodation  theory , aside from the objections that solely rehash \narguments addressed in the Report. The objections  concede that, of the theories  \nadvanced in the amended complaint , the reasonable  accommodation s theory is the \n“weakest.”  \niii. Improper Examinations  \n The amended complaint similarly fails to advance an ADA claim against \nExperis based on improper examinations.  For a current employee, an improper \nexamination means  a medical examination or an inquiry into  the nature and severity \nof an employee’s disabilit y, “unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-\nrelated and consistent with business necessity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(d)(4)(A). Here, in his objections to the Report, Palardy attempts to  characterize AT&T and IBM’s \npassword security requirements as effectively “literacy tests” akin to those used to “prevent certain people from voting in the South.” (Dkt.  #75 ¶  5). But the amended \ncomplaint does not allege any facts to support that bold  allegation. To the contrary, \nthe amended complaint alleges only that AT&T and IBM required employees to use multiple passwords and authenticate those passwords with special keys —both of \nwhich appear to be a business necessity  for which  the prohibition on discriminatory \n \nindividual to perform that function, or the necessary accommodation would impose an undue \nhardship.” Id. Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 11 of 13 PageID\n#:  <pageID>12 \n examinations does not apply. E ven if the requirements do not constitute  a business \nnecessity, the amended complaint fails to establish how those security requirements \nconstitute an examination directed toward his disability or how Experis contributed \nto the discrimination.  \n Palardy also asserts that McEnroe —the same AT&T manager who made \nallegedly problematic statements regarding Palardy’s performance and abilities —\nmade certain comments about Palardy’s  cochlear  implant and asked  him during a \nmeeting if he could hear. But the amended complaint provides scant  details \nsurrounding these allegations . It does not appear that McEnroe’s  statements rose to \nthe level of an examination directed toward Palardy’s disability. And if the statement did rise  to that level, the amended complaint fails nonetheless to plausibly allege that \nExperis was on notice of the statements and failed to take corrective measures within  \nits control.   \nB. The Claims Against Experis Should be Dismissed with Prej udice.  \n The Court also finds that the claims against Experis should be dismissed with \nprejudice and that Palardy should not be granted leave to amend his complaint. Although Palardy represents himself  in this action  without the benefit of an attorney, \nthat does not overcome the Court’s interest in efficiently administering this case and avoiding undue delay.  \n Before the deadline for filing amended pleadings lapsed Palardy had already \nreceived  notice of the deficiencies  in his complaint , and he was provided an \nopportunity  to cure them. Far from curing the deficiencies  and delivering a short and \nplain statement of the claims against Experis, however, the amended complaint Case 4:21-cv-00626-SDJ-AGD     Document 121     Filed 01/26/24     Page 12 of 13 PageID\n#:  <pageID>13 \n remains  lengthy  and disorganize d—of the sort that are frequently dismissed with \nprejudice in federal court.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n It is, therefore, ORDERED  that the Report and Recommendation of the \nUnited States Magistrate Judge, (Dkt.  #71), is hereby ADOPTED  and Palardy’s \nObjections, (Dkt.  #75), are OVERRULED . The claims against Experis are \nDISMISSED with prejudice .  \n This case will remain STAYED  pending the Court’s resolution of Defendants’ \nmotions for summary judgment.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In this court opinion, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California ruled on two motions in a case involving Devin Nunes against Ben Paul Meredith. Nunes alleged civil stalking and common law misappropriation. The court granted Meredith's motion to strike Nunes's claims under California's anti-SLAPP statute, dismissing the stalking claim with leave to amend and dismissing the misappropriation claim with prejudice. The case involves commentary and critique on social media platforms, but does not specifically involve AI or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the claims against Meredith for civil stalking and common law misappropriation are protected by California's anti-SLAPP statute, which aims to protect free speech related to public issues.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that Meredith's actions were protected under the anti-SLAPP statute because they constituted speech on a public platform about a public figure, Devin Nunes. As a result, the court dismissed the misappropriation claim with prejudice and the stalking claim with an option for Nunes to amend his complaint.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Think of anti-SLAPP laws as a shield to protect people when they talk about public issues, like politicians. Devin Nunes, a well-known politician, said Ben Meredith was bothering him online in bad ways. But the court said, \"Hold on, Ben's actions might just be free speech about a public issue.\" So, they told Devin, \"You need to show stronger evidence if you want to continue this complaint, except for one part that we're shutting down for good.\"",

BACKGROUND  \nA. Procedural Background  \nDevin Nunes originally filed his complaint in  Tulare Superior Court on October 5, 2020 , \nagainst Ben Paul Meredith and Twitter , Inc. (Doc. 1 at 8.) Nunes asserted two claims against \nMeredith: ( claim 1 ) stalking under California Civil Code §  1708.7 and ( claim 3 ) common law \nmisappropriation. (Id. at 8, 19-21, 25-26.) Nunes asserted two claims against Twitter : (claim 2 ) \naiding and abetting in the tort of stalking and ( claim 4 ) violation of unfair competition law under \nCalifornia Business and Professional Code §  1720 0 et seq . (Id. at 8, 21-30.) On January 14, 2021, \nNunes dismissed the claims  against Twitter. ( Id. at 2.)  \nOn January 20, 2021, Meredith removed the case to federal court.  (Doc. 1  at 1-5.) Before \nremoving the case, Meredith filed a motion to strike the complaint in its entirety under California \nCode of Civil Pro cedure §  425.16, also referred to  as an anti -SLAPP motion.  (See generally Mtn. \nStrike .) Nunes filed a response on December 9, 2020  (Doc. 10 -1 at 59-77 (“Oppo.  to Strike ”)) and \nlater filed a motion for leave to conduct spe cified discovery pursuant to California Civil \nProcedure §  425.16(g)  (see generally Mtn. Discovery ). The parties fully briefed both motions  \nbefore removal to this Court . (See Doc. 10 -1 at 92 -98 (“Reply”); Doc. 10 -1 at 122 -27 (“Sur -\nreply”) ; (Doc. 10 -1 at 155 -74 (responses to Mtn. Discovery )). On February 2, 12, 2021, Meredith \nmotioned the Court to review and rule on  the pending motions , as originally submitted . (Doc. 10 .) \nB. Factual Background  \nNunes’s complaint arises  from Meredith’s purported pattern of public,  negative \ncommentary about Nunes and his political career. (Doc. 1 at 14 -16.) As of the filing of the \ncomplaint, Devin Nunes served as the congressional representative for  California’s 22nd district.  \n(Id. at 11.) He has served on various committees in the U.S. House of Representatives,  such as the \nNational Parks Subcommittee a nd Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. ( Id.) Nunes has \nreceived criticism from many individuals for his political positions and actions taken pursuant to \nhis role in national politics. (Mtn. Strike at 12 -13.) He has also filed a myriad of lawsuits across \nthe country in attempts to stop this criticism . (Id.) His lawsuit against Meredith seeks similar \nrelief and makes broad allegations that Meredith use d multiple Twitter accounts to harass and Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 2 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n3  \n \n stalk Nunes. (Doc. 1 at 9-12.) Nunes did not submit copies of these posts , nor did he identify the \naccounts , which he contends Meredith manages as part of his alleged  scheme to stalk and harass \nNunes. (See id. ) \nAccording to Nunes, Meredith is a sophisticated artificial intelligence data scientist who \nco-founded a technology company , which creates and delivers artificial intelligence solutions. \n(Doc. 1 at 12.) Nunes further contends that Meredith used this “extensive experience” to la unch a \ncampaign of harassment on Twitter, designed “to embarrass Plaintiff, to make Plaintiff’s life \nmiserable, and to instill fea r in Plaintiff and others.” (Id. at 20.) Specifically, Nunes makes the \nfollowing allegations regarding Meredith’s conduct : \n• Operates multiple “anonym ous Twitter accounts in a scheme to follow, alarm and \nharass ” Nunes  (Doc. 1 at 12)  \n• Coordinated with “violent third partiers” (Doc. 1 at 12)  \n• “Doxed”2 Nunes’ s locations “dozens of times” (Doc. 1 at 10)  \n• “[T]weeted and retweeted thousands  of false, threatening, hateful, riotous, profanity -\nlaced, salacious and scandalous statements about Plaintiff” (Doc. 1 at 14) (emphasis in \noriginal)  \n• Accused Nunes of various sta te and federal crimes ( Doc. 1 at 14)  \n• Used “derogatory, insulting and threatening hashtags w ithin tweets” (Doc. 1 at 15)  \n• “[T]hreatened Plaintiff’s life and threated to come after Plaintiff” (Doc. 1 at 15)  \n• Used Nunes’s name , photograph , and likeness to sell  merchandise  and to conduct \n“professional fundraising ” with Meredith’s social media posts (Doc. 1 at 25 -26.)  \nNunes did not provide  any examples of th is alleged digital speech with his complaint.  \nWith his opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion , Nunes  included  a website screensho t which states  \nthat a woman named Michelle Emmett is responsible for the @devincow Twitter account  that was \nused to “troll Nunes” (i.e., to post Tweets about Nunes). (Oppo. to Strike at 85 (Nunes \nDeclaration).) Nunes also provid ed a screenshot of Emmett’s personal Twitter account . (Id. at \n \n2 “‘Dox’ means to publicly identify or publish private information about a particular ind ividual on the Internet with \nmalicious intent, especially as a form of punishment or revenge.” ( Oppo. to Strike  at 69 n.5.)  Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 3 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n4  \n \n 86.) Nunes asserts a connection exists between Emmett and Meredith because  Meredith posted \nmany Tweets tagging the Emmett’s personal  account and  research from  “Whitepages ” shows the \ntwo were married . (Id.) Nunes provided no  further examples, screenshots, or other evidence of the \nalleged connection.  \nIn general, Meredith denies these claims  and maintains Nunes’s incorrectly attributes the \nstatements to Meredith.  (Mtn. Strike  at 12; Reply at 94 -95.) According to Meredith, even if he \nwere responsible for  the accused digital speech, these statements fall under the protection of the \nFirst Amendment  and filed a motion to strike the complaint in its entirety under the anti -SLAPP \nstatute.  (Mtn. Strike at 12, 16.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS  Meredith’s \nmotion to dismiss and DENIES  Nunes’s motion for leave to conduct discovery.  \nII. LEGAL ST ANDARDS  \nA. Anti -SLAPP Motion to Strike under § 425.16  \nUnder California law, “SLAPP” lawsuits refer to “strategic litigation against public \nparticipation ,” and they attempt  “to chill or punish a party’s exercise of constitutional rights to \nfree speech and to p etition the government for redress of grievances.” Rusheen v. Cohen , 37 Cal. \n4th 1048,  1055  (2006).  California’s anti -SLAPP statute, California  Civil Procedure  § 425.16, \ncreates an avenue  for pre-trial dismissal of  SLAPP lawsuits  that “masquerade as ordinary \nlawsuits ” but aim to deter “ expression through costly, time -consuming litigation.” Makaeff v. \nTrump Univ ., 715 F.3d 254,  261 (9th Cir. 2013) ( internal quotations omitted ); Metabolife Int ’l, \nInc. v. Wornick , 264 F.3d 832, 839 (9th Cir. 2001); Wilco x v. Superior Court , 27 Cal. App. 4th \n809, 819 (1994)).   \nUnder the anti -SLAPP statute, a  defendant may move to strike a claim or complaint when \nthe underlying conduct underlying was an “act in furtherance of [the] right to petition or free \nspeech.” Wilcox , 27 Cal. App. 4th at  818. In relevant part, § 425.16 provides:  \nA cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance \nof the person ’s right of petition or free speech under the United States or California \nConstitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion \nto strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a \nprobability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.  \nCal. Civ. Pro c. § 425.16 (b). Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 4 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n5  \n \n  To evaluate a n anti-SLAPP motion , courts use a two -step analysis . Daniels v. Robbins , \n182 Cal. App. 4th 204, 214  (2010).  First, the defendant bears the initial burden to demonstrate the \nchallenged causes of action arise from an act in furtherance of the defendant’s right of petition or \nfree speech, including:  \n(1) any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative, executive, or \njudicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, (2) any \nwritten or oral statement o r writing made in connection with an issue under \nconsideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other \nofficial proceeding authorized by law, (3) any written or oral statement or writing \nmade in a place open to the public or a  public forum in connection with an issue of \npublic interest, or (4) any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the \nconstitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in \nconnection with a public issue or an issue of public  interest.   \nCal. Civ. Proc. § 425.16(e).  The moving defendant must  “identify [] all allegations of protected \nactivity, and the claims for relief supported by them.” Baral v. Schnitt , 1 Cal. 5th 376, 396  (2016).  \nIf the defendant satisfies this burden, the analysis moves to step two . At step two , the \nburden shifts to the plaintiff to show a probability of prevailing on the challenged claim. \nMetabolife Int ’l, 264 F.3d at 840; Daniels , 182 Cal. App. 4th at 214.  The N inth Circuit held that \ncourts must apply federal rules of procedure when determining the proper  standard of review to \nassess the probability of prevailing . Planned  Parenthood Fed ’n of Am., Inc. v. Ctr. for Med. \nProgress , 890 F.3d 828, 834 (9th Cir.  2018 ). The standard of review depends on how the anti -\nSLAPP motion is styled. Herring Networks, Inc. v. Maddow , 8 F.4th 1148, 1156 (9th Cir. 2021) \n(noting the “division of anti -SLAPP motions to strike into two categories: motions that challenge \nthe legal sufficie ncy of complaints and motions that challenge the factual sufficiency of \ncomplaints”). When “an anti -SLAPP motion to strike challenges only the legal sufficiency of a \nclaim,” the standard of review under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) applies. Planned  \nParenthood , 890 F.3d  at 834. “[O]n the other hand, when an anti -SLAPP motion to strike \nchallenges the factual sufficiency of a claim, then the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 standard \nwill apply. But in such a case, discovery must be allowed, with opportunities to supplement \nevidence based on the factual challenges, before any decision is made by the court.” Id.  \n/// \n/// Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 5 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n6  \n \n B. Motion for Leave to Conduct Discovery under California  Civil Procedure  § 425.16(g)  \nAs part of his response to Meredith’s anti-SLAPP motion, Nunes filed a motion for leave \nto conduct  specified discovery and to preclude ruling on the anti -SLAPP motion  until he has an \nopportunity to obtain such discovery . (Mtn. Discovery  at 144-45.) Under C alifornia Civil \nProcedure Code § 425.16(g), a court may order “specified discovery” on proper motion showing \n“good cause.” However, Ninth Circuit precedent establishes that t his provision, along with the \nother limited discovery aspects of §  425.16 contradi cts the federal rules. Planned Parenthood , \n890 F.3d at 833 -34. Because a federal court follows its procedural rules rather than conflicting \nstate rules, the Court must apply the typical discovery procedures under Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule \n56. Id.; see also Er ie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins , 304 U.S. 64 , 78 (1938). The Court, therefore, will \nconstrue Nunes ’s motion for specified discovery  under the federal procedural rules.  \nUnder a 12(b)(6) standard, discovery is not required to determine  the sufficiency of the \npleadings. Rutman Wine Co. v. E. & J. Gallo Winery , 829 F.2d 729, 738  (9th Cir. 1987 ) (holding \nplaintiff not entitled to discovery prior to dismissal because “the purpose of Rule 12(b)(6) is to \nenable  defendant s to challenge the leg al sufficiency of  complaint s allegations without subjecting \nthemselves  to discovery ”). Under Rule 56, however, courts may postpone summary judgment to \nallow discovery where the party makes the requisite showing under Rule 56( d). See Family Home \n& Fin. Ctr. , Inc. v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp ., 525 F.3d 822, 827 (9th Cir. 2008). Thus, \nwhether Nunes is entitled to discovery depends on whether the Court reviews Meredith’s anti -\nSLAPP motion as a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment  at step two of th e anti -\nSLAPP analysis . \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Conduct in Furtherance of Speech  \nUnder step one of the anti -SLAPP analysis, the defendant must show the alleged  activities \nthat form the basis of the asserted  claims are “protected ,” thereby bring ing the claim within the \nscope of the anti -SLAPP statute.  Graham-Sult v. Clainos , 756 F.3d 724, 735 (9th Cir. 2014) \n(citing Wallace v. McCubbin , 196 Cal. App.  4th 1169 , 1183  (2011) ). To be protected under the \nstatute, “the acts underlying the plaintiff’s caus e of action [must] fall within one of the four Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 6 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n7  \n \n categories spelled out in section 425.16 , subdivision (e) .” Collier v. Harris , 240 Cal. App. 4th 41, \n50-52 (2015).  \nMeredith argues that activities underlying Nunes’s claim s for stalking and \nmisappropriation  arise from conduct  in further of speech  protected under § 425.16(e)(3) of the \nanti-SLAPP statute. (Mtn. Strike at 18 -20.) This subsection protects statements “made in a place \nopen to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue  of public interest.” Cal. Civ. \nProc. § 425.16(e)(3). The inquiry does not depend on “the form of the plaintiff’s cause of action \nbut, rather, the defendant’s activity that gives ris e to his or her asserted liability.” Hilton v. \nHallmark Cards , 599 F.3d 89 4, 905 (9th Cir. 2010) (quoting Navellier v. Sletten , 29 Cal. 4th 82, \n92 (2002)).  The court focus es on the nature of the activity and whether the associated speech \noccurred “in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.” See Steep Hill Labs., \nInc. v. Moore , 2018 WL 1242182 , at *5  (N.D. Cal. Mar. 8, 2018) (internal quotations omitted) \n(evaluating whether a  cause of action for stalking meets step one of the anti -SLAPP analysis by \nconsidering whether the statements underlying the stalking claim related to a public interest); see \nalso World Fin. Grp., Inc. v. HBW Ins. & Fin. Servs., Inc. , 172 Cal. App. 4th 156 1, 15 68 (2009) .  \nWhether statements concern a public interest is  construed broadly. Gilbert v. Sykes , 147 \nCal. App. 4th 13, 23 (2007). California Court s have  identified three categories of public interests : \n“(1) statements ‘concern[ing] a person or entity in the public eye ’; (2) ‘conduct that could directly \naffect a large number of people beyond the direct participants ’; (3) ‘or a topic of widespread, \npublic interest. ’” Hilton , 599 F.3d at 906 ; Rivero v. Am . Fed’n of State, Cnty., and Mun . Emps ., \nAFL-CIO, 105 Cal. App. 4th 913,  924 (2003) . However, the anti -SLAPP statute excludes  \nstatements “not made in the context of any public discussion,” are not “directed at encouraging \nothers to participate in the discussion,” and do not “have any effect on a sub stantial number of \npeople beyond those to whom the information [ is] directly conveyed.” World Fin. Grp. , 172 Cal. \nApp. 4th at 1572 -73. \nNunes’s claim s arise from Meredith’s alleged  repeated instances of “cyberstalking” on \nTwitter by posting negative, threatening, harassing statements. (Oppo. to Strike  at 68 .) Nunes \nalleges Meredith made “ thousands  of false, threatening, hateful, riotous, profanity -laced, Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 7 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n8  \n \n salacious and scandalous stat ements .” (Doc. 1 at 14 (emphasis in original).) According to Nunes, \nMeredith’s posts on Twitter included accusations that Nunes committed federal and state crimes  \nand “directly threatened” Nunes’ s life and property. ( Id. at 14 -15.) Meredith argues these \nstatements constitute  protected conduct because they occurred in a public forum and relate to an \nissue of public interest. ( Mtn. Strike  at 18-20.) The Court agrees.  \nFirst, Meredith’s post on Twitter occurred in a public forum because “websites [that] are \naccessible to the public” are considered public forums for the purposes of the anti -SLAPP statute. \nJackson v. Mayweather , 10 Cal. App. 5th 1240 , 125 2 (2017)  (statements made on Facebook \nconstitute in a public forum). Nunes does not dispute this conclusion.  \nSecond, the content of Meredith’s Tweets relates to a public interest as defined under the \nanti-SLAPP statute. According to Nunes, Meredith ’s posts on Twitter  all involve some form of \nnegative commentary on Nune s. (Oppo.  to Strike at 68 -69.) As Nunes himself explains, he is a \nUnited States Congressman, representing California’s 22nd Congressional District and serves as a \nRanking Member of the House Permanent Se lect Committee on Intelligence. (Id. at 67.)  “High \nprofile individuals,” such as politicians and celebrities, are persons in the public eye and of public \ninterest that typically receive “extensive media scrutiny.” Jackson , 10 Cal. App. 5th at 1254  \n(finding  statements on social media regarding a celebrity’s various medical conditions and \ntreatments  are matters of public interest); see also  Henley v. Jacobs , 2019 WL 8333524 , at *9  \n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 2, 2019) (concluding statements regarding “competitors and poli ticians, \nunquestionably concern an ‘entity in the public eye ’ on a matter of ‘widespread public interest’ ”).  \nMeredith’s commentary on Nunes as a political leader constitut es a topic of widespread \npublic interest because “the right to speak on political matters is the quintessential subject of our \nconstitutional protections .” Collier , 240 Cal. App. 4th at 52-53 (holding the registration of \ndomain names for websites used to e ndorse and discuss political candidates was in furtherance of \nprotected speech under the anti -SLAPP statute); Roberts v. Los Angeles Bar Assn. , 105 Cal. App. \n4th 604, 614 (2003) (internal quotations omitted) (“Public discussion about the qualifications of \nthose who hold or wish to hold positions of public trust presents the strongest possible case for \napplications of the safeguards afforded by the First Amendment.”) . Critiques of Nunes’s Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 8 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n9  \n \n qualifications as political leader, such as statements about his crimi nal history, further underscore  \na public interest concern. Matson v. Dvorak , 40 Cal. App. 4th 539, 543, 548 (1995)  (affirming \ntrial court’s dismissal of a political candidate’s invasion of privacy claim where a flyer alleged the \ncandidate owed hundreds of dollars to the police department for unpaid fines).  \nNunes does not dispute that  Meredith’s Tweets concern a widespread public interest or \nthat he is in the public eye. Instead, Nunes broadly asserts that “ [w]hen words are part of a pattern \nof stalking or harassing behavior, they do not constitute protected speech .” (Oppo.  to Strike  at \n64.) Nunes provides  no authority to support his assertion. Despite listing approximately three \npages of case law, none offer  any guidanc e to interpret the protections of California’s anti -SLAPP \nstatute. (Id. at 64 -66.) The vast majority of Nunes’s authorities originate from  other jurisdictions, \nirrelevant  to California law.  (Id.) The few cases Nunes cited from the Ninth Circuit and California \ncourts, do not involve challenges to the anti -SLAPP protections, but rather analyzed First \nAmendment protections  to rebut stalking and harassment  allegations . See, e.g. , People v. Borelli , \n77 Cal. App. 4th 703, 716  (2000); United Artists Corp . v. United Artist Studios, LLC , 2019 WL \n6917918, at *10 (C.D. Cal. 2019).  Nunes did not explain how the  First Amendment  protections \napply t o the analysis of step one under the anti -SLAPP statute.  To the contrary, t he California \nLegislature “did not limit the scope of the anti -SLAPP statute to activity protect by the \nconstitutional rights of speech and petition. It went on to include ‘any act . . . in furtherance of’ \nthose rights.” City of Montebello v. Vasquez , 1 Ca l.5th 409, 421 (2016) (emphasis in original). \nAccordingly, when determining the scope of anti -SLAPP protections, courts must  look to “the \nstatutory definitions in section 425.16, subdivision (e),” not simply to First Amendment law. Id. \nat 422; see also Dea n v. Friends of Pine Meadow , 21 Cal. App. 5th 91 , 106  (2018) (citing \nMontebello , 1 Cal.  5th at 422) ( “Montebello  precludes plaintiffs from using substantive First \nAmendment principles to limit the scope of protection afforded by the anti -SLAPP law.”).  \nTo the extent Nunes attempts to argue that the alleged conduct is illegal  as a matter of law  \nand, t hus, beyond the purview  of the anti-SLAPP statute , Nunes has not met his burden to show \nthis exception applies. The California Supreme Court recognizes an exception to the anti-SLAPP \nprotections  for conduct that is “conclusively established” as illegal , because the statute only Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 9 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n10  \n \n protects valid  activities taken in furtherance of constitutional rights . Zucchet v. Galardi , 229 Cal.  \nApp.  4th 1466, 1478 (2014) (citing Flatley v. Mauro , 39 Cal.  4th 299, 3 20 (2006)) . However, the \n“exception for illegal activity is very narrow and applies only in undisputed cases of illegality.”  \nId. at 1478 . To establish the exception applies, the plaintiff must show the conduct is illegal as a \nmatter of law “through defendant’s concession or by uncontroverted and conclusive evidence.” \nFlately , 39 Cal.  4th at 3 20. If a “factual dispute exists about the legitimacy of the defendant’s \nconduct,” the exception does not appl y at step one of the anti -SLAPP analysis . Id. at 316.  \nTo the extent Nunes  argues the illegal conduct exception applies, he has not sufficiently \nevidenced the alleged stalking or harassing is  illegal as a matter of law. Nunes alleges “Meredith \ndirectly threatened Plaintiff’s life and threatened to come after Plaintiff.” (Doc. 1 at 15.) Nunes \ncontends he “reasonably believes that Meredith’s ongoing pattern of conduct will eventually \nresult in a violent attack on Plaintiff. ” (Id. at 16.) Indeed, “true threats ” include those where “the \nspeak er means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful \nviolenc e to a particular individual or group of individuals” and fall outside the anti -SLAPP \nprotections. D.C. v. R.R. , 182 Cal. App. 4th 1190 , 1218 -19 (2010) (affirming the anti -SLAPP \nstatute did not protect a threat containing explicit details about defendant’s desire to murder the \nplaintiff  and where the defendant confirmed he made these statements  on the Inte rnet).  \nNonetheless, under the illegal conduct exception, a dispute of fact regarding the seriousness of the \nintent  renders the exception inapplicable. See Dziubla v. Piazza , 59 Cal. App. 5th 140 , 145  (2020) \n(holding a “thinly veiled threat ” about what could happen if plaintiff continued to pursue \nlitigation does not amount to illegal conduct as a matter of law). Meredith denies making any \nthrea tening statements towards Nunes and disputes the seriousne ss of any alleged threats.3 (Reply \nat 95.) B ecause factual disputes exist regarding the speaker’s intent and identity , the Court finds \n \n3 In Nunes’s response to the anti -SLAPP motion, he makes an additional allegation claiming, “Meredith threatened \nPlaintiff’s life in  September 2019 by posting a tweet that encouraged Plaintiff to cut his throat with a razor.” (Oppo. \nto Strike at 68.) Allegations not made with the original complaint are not properly before the Court. Lee v. City of Los \nAngeles , 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Ci r. 2001) (As a general rule, courts “may not consider any material beyond the \npleadings in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.”). Regardless, even if the Court were to consider these allegations, it \nstill does not satisfy Nunes’s burden because this allegati on is subject to a factual dispute. Meredith disputes having \nmade the alleged threat and questions whether the Tweet was intended in a joking manner. (Reply at 95 -96, n.1.)  Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 10 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n11  \n \n the alleged threats do not fall under the exception for illegal conduct .  \nFinally, Nunes argues the anti -SLAPP statutes does not protect the activities giving rise to \nhis claims because the y are “conduct, not his speech.” ( Oppo. to Strike  at 74.) Nunes again \nprovides a lengthy list of inapplicable cases, by citing unpublished opinions4 from California \ncourts. (Id. at 74 -75.) Notably , the statute explicitly covers conduct not merely speech. See Cal. \nCiv. Proc. § 425.16(b) (emphasis added) (protecting “any act of that person in furtherance of the \nperson’s right of petition or free speech”).  Thus, Nunes ha s no authoritative rebuttal to the \nconclusion that the alleged behavior giving rise to his claims falls under the protected activity of \nthe anti -SLAPP statute.  \nB. Probability of Prevailing on Claims  \n1. Applicable Standard of Review for Meredith’s Anti -SLAPP Motion  \nBefore the Court can evaluate  the probability of success under  step two of the anti -SLAPP \nanalysis, it must first determine the relevant standard of review according to Planned Parenthood . \nPlanned  Parenthood , 890 F.3d at 834. Because Meredith filed the motion before removing the \ncase to federal court , Meredith styled  the motion  under California procedure for anti -SLAPP \nmotions . As detailed above, federal procedures  to review anti-SLAPP motions differ from \nCalifornia procedures. Id. Meredith filed the motion befor e discovery  began, which indicates the \nCourt should  const rue Meredith’s motion under the 12(b)(6) standard. Penrose Hill, Ltd. v. \nMabray , 479 F. Supp. 3d 840 , 849  (N.D. Cal. 2020) (reviewing only the legal challenges in an \nanti-SLAPP motion removed from state court because “factual challenges are premature as no \ndiscovery has yet taken place”). Otherwise, to apply a summary judgment standard, the Court \nmust first a llow the parties to take discovery. Toranto v. Jaffurs , 2016 WL 11621397 , *2 (S.D. \nCal. Nov. 23, 2016) (quoting Z.F. v. Ripon Unified School Dist. , 482 Fed. App ’x 239, 240 (9th \nCir. 2012) (“Where an anti -SLAPP motion is based on factual arguments, ‘then th e motion must \n \n4 The California Rules of Civil Procedure prohibit both Nunes and the Court from citing to or otherwise relying on \nunpublished opinions. Cal Rules of Court, Rule 8.1115(a) (“Except as provided in (b), an opinion of a California \nCourt of Appeal or superior co urt appellate division that is not certified for publication or ordered published must not \nbe cited or relied on by a court or a party in any other action.”); see also State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Penske \nTruck Leasing Co., L.P., 2021 WL 4810642, at *2  (9th Cir. Oct. 15, 2021) (“But California prohibits other courts \nfrom citing its unpublished cases.”).  Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 11 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n12  \n \n be treated though it were a motion for summary judgment, and discovery must be permitted.’”) ). \nMoreover , Meredith’s arguments about  why Nunes lacks a probability of prevailing \nfurther suggest  the Rule 12(b)(6)  standard is appropriate  because they primarily focus on the legal \nsufficiency of Nunes’s claims as pled in the complaint . Meredith argues the First Amendment \nbars both claims as a matter of law . (Mtn. Strike 21 -25.) Meredith further argues that Nunes failed \nto plead  one of the statutory elements for civil stalking by not providing any independent \ncorroborating evidence. ( Id. at 26.) Meredith also argues California Civil Code §  3344(d) defeats \nthe misappropriation claim. (Id. at 25 -26.) Meredith’s  arguments  relate to the sufficiency of the \nclaims on their face and therefore resemble  arguments made on motions to dismiss.  Shapour v. \nDOT , 2014 WL 3850012 , at *3  (E.D. Cal. Aug. 5, 2014)  (“[T]he district court resolves a facial \nchallenge as it would a Rule 12(b)( 6) motion to dismiss.”) ; see also My Daily Choice, Inc. v. \nButler , 2021 WL 3475547 , at *3  (D. Nev. Aug. 6, 2021) (“A facial challenge attacks the \nsufficiency of the allegations and mirrors a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.”).   \nAs previously discussed, a motion to dismiss does not require special discovery as Nunes \nrequest s in his motion ( Mtn. Discovery ). Because the Court will review Meredith’s anti -SLAPP \nmotion as a motion to dismiss,  the Court need not allow discovery to assess whether Nunes has \nsufficie ntly plead his claims. See Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 \n(9th Cir. 2008) ( “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only where the complaint lacks a \ncognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal theory. ”); see also \nMetabolife , 264 F.3d at 846-47 (concluding that  the discovery stay required by Cal ifornia  Civil \nProcedure  Code § 425.16(g) does not apply in federal court) . Accordingly, the Court DENIES \nNunes’s motion for specified dis covery under pursuant to California Civil Procedure §  425.16(g).  \n2. Motion to Dismiss Standard under Rule 12(b)(6)  \nUnder Rule 12(b)(6), the Court’s review is limited to the allegations in the complaint. \nCervantes v. City of San Diego , 5 F.3d 1273, 1276 (9th C ir. 1993). (Under Rule 12(b)(6), “review \nis limited to the complaint alone.”); See also Herring Networks , 8 F.4th at 1155 -56 (holding \ndistrict court did not err in refusing to consider evidence submitted by the parties “outside  of the \npleadings” because pl aintiff cannot convert the anti -SLAPP motion into one for summary Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 12 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n13  \n \n judgment). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, \naccepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqb al, 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). The Supreme \nCourt explained,  \nA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows \nthe court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a “probability \nrequirement,” but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are “merely c onsistent with” a \ndefendant’s liability, it “stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility \nof ‘entitlement to relief.’”  \nIqbal , 556 U.S. at 6 63 (internal citations omitted).  \n“The issue is not whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the claimant is \nentitled to offer evidence to support the claims. Indeed it may appear on the face of the pleadings \nthat a recovery is very remote and unlikely but that is not the t est.” Scheuer v. Rhodes , 416 U.S. \n232, 236 (1974). The Court “will dismiss any claim that, even when construed in the light most \nfavorable to plaintiff, fails to plead sufficiently all required elements of a cause of action.” \nStudent Loan Marketing Assoc. v. Hanes , 181 F.R.D. 629, 634 (S.D. Cal. 1998). To the extent \npleading deficiencies can be cured by the plaintiff alleging additional facts, leave to amend should \nbe granted. Cook, Perkiss & Liehe, Inc. v. N. Cal. Collection Serv. , 911 F.2d 242, 247 (9th C ir. \n1990) (citations omitted).  \n3. Claim 1: Civil Stalking under Cal. Civ. Code §  1708.7   \na. Whether Claim Is Barred by First Amendment  \nMeredith argues Nunes’ s stalking claim fails as a matter of law because it is barred by the \nFirst Amendment. (Mtn. Strike at 21 -25.) Meredith primarily relies on  reasoning  from a case  \noutside this Court’s jurisdiction and involving  a criminal indictment for cyberstalking. United  \nStates v. Cassidy , 814 F. Supp. 2d 574 , 576, 583 (D. Md. 2011).  In Cassidy , the court concluded \nthe First Amendment rendered the defendant’s indictment  under the federal stalking statute  \nunconstitutional because defendant’s conduct fell under protected speech and the criminal \nstatute’s content -based restriction did not survive strict scrutiny, as applied to the defendant’s Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 13 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n14  \n \n case. Id. at 582-85. The court recognized that “true threats” rema in unprotected by the First \nAmendment . Id. at 583. However, the  court found none of the harassing statements by the \ndefendant amounted to a true threat  but were merely  “speech [that] may have inflicted substantial \nemotional distress.” Id.  \nAs explained abo ve, a factual dispute exists regarding the circumstances of the alleged \nthreat to Nunes’s life and whether it constitutes a “true threat.” Although  under the first prong of \nthe anti -SLAPP statute this factual dispute must be resolved in Meredith’s favor, u nder the second \nprong, a s required under  Planned Parenthood , the Court must view any factual dispute in the \nlight most favorable to Nunes. Planned  Parenthood , 890 F.3d at 834;  Mangiaracina v. Penzone , \n849 F.3d 1191, 1198 (9th Cir. 2017)  (“At [the motion to dismiss] stage, we accept all allegations \nof material fact as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.”) . Assuming \nNunes’s allegations made in the complaint are true—that Meredith was responsible for  a \nthreatening post and d id so with serious intent to inflict harm on Nunes —the complaint has \nsufficiently pled facts to overcome a First Amendment defense  because a true threat does not fall \nunder First Amendment protection .  \nEven if Meredith could establish the statements did no t constitute true threats, Meredith \nhas not cited, and the Court has not found, any authorities applying the First Amendment defense \nas a matter of law to California’s civil stalking statute. The issue, in Cassidy , involved applying \nthe First Amendment def ense to a federal criminal statute for stalking. Cassidy , 814 F. Supp. 2d \nat 582-85. Given the  discrepancies between  the offense  charged in  Cassidy and Nunes’s  civil \nclaim, the Court declines to extend the reasoning from Cassidy  to California’s civil code, without \nguidance from state courts on this matter.  See Lantz Ret. Invs., LLC v. Glover , 2021 WL 6118182 , \nat *8  (E.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 2021)  (declining to apply the party’s cit ed case under Oregon law to an \nissue arising under California law where the party provided no controlling authority) ; Covenant \nMedia of Cal., L.L.C. v. City of Huntington Park , 377 F. Supp. 2d 828, 837 n.26 (C.D. Cal. 2005)  \n(declining to resolve an issue of California law without “California authority directly on point”).  \nb. Sufficiency of Corroborating Evidence to Support Claim  \nEven if the First Amendment does not bar Nunes’s stalking claim , Meredith argues  Nunes Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 14 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n15  \n \n failed to sta te a claim for civil stalking under § 1708.7 because he did not provide corroborating \nevidence to support his claim. (Mtn. Strike at 26.) Under § 1708.7, “the plaintiff shall be required \nto support his or her allegations with independent corroborating evid ence.” Cal. Civ. Code \n§ 1708.7 (a)(1)  (emphasis added). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” \nIqbal , 556 U.S.  at 678 (quoting Twomb ly, 550 U.S. at 570). The 12(b)(6) standard requires \nplaintiff to make a showing under every  element of the asserted  claim. Student Loan Marketing \nAssoc. , 181 F.R.D. at 634.  \nNunes did not provide any corroborating evidence such to satisfy this element of the civil \nstalking statute. Despite alleging that Meredith posted thousands of statements  disparaging and \nthreatening Nunes  on Twitter, a public and freely accessible platform, Nunes did not provide any \nof these allegedly offending posts to the Court. (See Doc. 1 at 14.) Nunes did not submit  any \ncommunications or statements by  Meredith  to corroborate his allegation that Meredith posted \nthousands of Tweets disparaging Nunes .  \nThe only documentary evidence that Nunes attached , undermines rather than corroborates \nhis claim. With his opposition to the motion to dismiss,5 Nunes submitted a screenshot from a \nwebsite, purportedly identifying Michelle Emmet as the owner of the @devincow Twitter account \nused to “tr oll Nunes.”  (Doc. 10 -1 at 85 -86 (Nunes Declaration).)  Nunes also included a \nscreenshot of Michelle Emmett’s  personal  Twitter page. (Id.) Nunes contends he reviewed  \nEmmett’s Tweets which revealed  “she was tagged by Meredith in innumerable tweets about \n[Nunes].”  (Id.) Nunes, however, did not submit a ny of these “innumerable” Tweets. Nunes also \nclaims the “Whitepages” indicated  Emmett was married to Meredith.6 (Id.) Nunes likewise failed \n \n5 Typically , the Court  will not consider evidence outside the pleadings on a motion to d ismiss.  However, because the \nparties briefed the anti -SLAPP motion according to differing state court procedures  and to accord the most favorable \nreview to Nunes , the Court gives a cursory review of the evidence  contained in Nunes’s declaration  as part of the \nmotion to strike. See Drexler v. Billet , 784 F. App’x 548, 549 (9th Cir. 2019) ( Where  the court relied on the “general \nnature of Drexler’s allegations, only glancingly referenced Billet’s declaration” it did  not incorrectly apply the Rule \n12(b)(6)  standard.).  \n6 The Court fails to see the relevance of this fact. To the extent that Nunes intends to convey that Meredith is \nresponsible for Emmett’s Tweets because he was married to her, the Court rejects that noti on as unfounded at this \ntime; Nunes has cited no case  law suggesting that the actions of an individual can be imputed to their spouse as a \nmatter of law or fact in these circumstances.  Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 15 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n16  \n \n to provide this alleged evidence.  \nConsidering only the evidence Nunes has submitted, the website and Emmett ’s Twitter \npage indicate s Emmett , not Meredith , is responsible  for the alleged harassment and stalking  of \nNunes on Twitter. Nothing in the record links Meredith to Emmett’s accounts. While the 12(b)(6) \nstandard requires the Court to take facts in the light favorable to the plaintiff and make \nreasonable  inferences, it does not require the Court to make illo gical leaps. See Fazaga v. FBI , \n916 F.3d 1202, 1211 (9th Cir. 2019) (internal citations omitted) (“Conclusory allegations and \nunreasonable inferences, however, are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.”) . Accordingly, \nnone of the documentary evidence  provided by Nunes connects Meredith to the alleged \nharassment or stalking.7  Thus, Nunes has failed to sufficiently plead all explicit elements of  \nstalking claim under  § 1708.7 . Rydberg v. U .S. Postal Serv. , 2021 WL 1851033 , *7 (N.D. Cal. \nJan. 21, 2021) (finding the complaint’s  failure to provide  “independent corroborating evidence for \n[defendant’s] behavior  or identify conduct that constitutes a specific credible threa t” failed to \nstate a claim for civil stalking); see also  Roberts v. Levine , 2019 WL 5650626 , at *10  (S.D. Cal. \nOct. 30, 2019) (finding Facebook messages attached to the complaint showing  defendants \nreached out to plaintiff several times, but in a positive manner,  did not satisfy plaintiff’s burden to \nprovide corroborating evidence for its stalking claim). Because Nunes did not sufficiently plead \nhis claim for civil stalking , he failed  to show a probability of success at the motion to dismiss \nstage.  \n4. Claim 3 : Common Law Misappropriation   \nMeredith makes two arguments to support his conclusion that Nunes’s misappropriation \nclaim should be dismissed. First, Meredith contends the First Amendment bars the claim. (Mtn. \nStrike at 21-25.) Second, Meredith argues the statutory exemptions under §  3344(d) prohibit \n \n7 Nunes identifies  another incident for which he provided no evidence or logical basis to attribute it to Meredith. \nNunes claims that Meredith was associated with a political activist who “harassed” Nunes on plane. (Doc. 1 at 10). \nAccording to Nunes, Meredith  endorsed the i ncident by posting photos of it.  (Id.) However, Nunes  did not provide \nscreenshots of Meredith’s alleged posts . Although Meredith submitted a copy of a news article reporting the incident \nwith his motion, nothing in this article implicates Meredith’s invol vement . (Mtn.  Strike, Ex. A.) Therefore, this \npotential evidence  suffers from the same defect as the @devincow Twitter page because it shows no connection  to an \naction or statement by Meredith.  Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 16 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n17  \n \n common law mis appropriation actions arising f rom conduct concerning public affairs . (Id. at 26.)  \nAs described below, because the Court agrees that §  3344(d) bars Nunes’s misappropriation \nclaim, the Court need not reach Meredith’s  First Amendment argument.  \nSection 3344(d) prohibits a cause of action under the statute for unauthorized use of a \nperson’s name , voice, signature, photograph, or likeliness if used “in connection with any news, \npublic affairs, or sports broadcast or account, or any political campaign.” Cal. Civ. Code \n§ 3344(d). California cou rts and the Ninth Circuit appl y this statutory exemption to both the \nstatutory and common law causes of action for  commercial  misappropriation . See Dora v. \nFrontline Video, Inc. , 15 Cal. App. 4th 536 , 545 (1993)  (“[T]he resolution of the statutory cause \nof action would determine the plaintiff ’s ability to maintain the common law cause of action.”); \nsee also Gionfriddo v. Major League Baseball , 94 Cal. App. 4th 400 , 416 -17 (2001) ( applying the \n“public affairs” defense under §  3344(d) to a common law claim for misappropriation);  Estate of \nFuller v. Maxfield & Oberton Holdings, LLC , 906 F. Supp. 2d 997, 1010  (9th Cir. 2012)  (“In \nother words, California courts do not apply a common law public interest defense, separate and \napart from the statutory public  affairs defense, to statutory right of publicity claims.”) .  \nNunes  did not respond to the argument that §  3344(d) bars his misappropriation claim but \nargue d only that “Meredith offers no fact to support any ‘transformative use’ defense.” ( Oppo. to \nStrike  at 77 .) The “transformative use” defense relates to Meredith’s arg ument under the First \nAmendment defense but does not apply to the statutory exemption.  See Comedy III Prods ., Inc. v. \nGary Saderup, Inc. , 25 Cal. 4th 387 , 398 -407 (2001) (outlining the balancing test applied in cases \nwhere defendant asserts the First Amendment bars a claim for  misappropriation ).  \nSeparate from his First Amendment defense, Meredith argues the statutory exemption \nunder §  3344(d) bars Nunes’s claim because the alleged conduct underlying the claim relates to a \nmatter of public affairs . (Mtn. Strike at 25 -26.) According to Nunes’ allegations,  Meredith has \nused Nunes name , photograph,  and likeness “for professional fund -raising” and to promote \nhimself and his “multiple anonymous Twitter accounts.” (Doc. 1 at 25.) Nunes contends Meredith \nused his identity and likeness for his own commercial and personal purposes  and profited from \nthis use in connection with Meredith’s “tweets and o ther social media posts.” ( Id.) Nunes does not Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 17 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n18  \n \n dispute , however,  that the challenged conduct relates to Meredith’s critique of Nunes as a \npolitical figure.  (See Oppo. to Strike at 67 -68.) In fact, Nunes affirmatively alleges Meredith’s \nintent for appropria ting his likeness was to “take advantage of Plaintiff’s reputation, prestige, and \nknown brand in Tulare County.” (Doc. 1 at 26.) According to Nunes, Meredith’s scheme of \ndigital speech targets and seeks to disparage Nunes’s reputation as a political figure  in the \ncommunity. ( Id. at 9-10.) Matters of current political issues , such as commentary on the \nsuitability of a political official  squarely fall within the §  3344(d) exemptions. Michaels v. \nInternet Ent m’t Grp., 1998 WL 882848 , at **3 -4 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 10, 1998)  (noting §  3344(d) \nprovides a “complete newsworthiness defense” which includes “discussion of politics and public \naffairs”) ; Dora , 15 Cal. App. 4th at 545-46 (noting the “public affairs” exemption under \n§ 3344(d) includes matters of public i nterest beyond just “politics or public policy”). Because the \nchallenged conduct arises in the context of Meredith’s critique of Nunes as a politician , the Court \nfinds § 3344(d) bars Nunes’s claim for misappropriation. 8  \nC. Leave to Amend  \nPursuant to Rule 15 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, leave to amend “shall be \nfreely granted  when justice so requires,” bearing in mind “the underlying purpose of Rule 15 to \nfacilitate decisions on the merits, rather than on the pleadings or techni calities.” Lopez v. Smith , \n203 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2000) (alterations, internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, \nleave to amend generally shall be denied only if allowing amendment would unduly prejudice the \nopposing party, cause undue delay, o r be futile, or if the moving party acted in bad faith. \nLeadsinger, Inc. v. BMG Music Pub ’g, 512 F.3d 522, 532 (9th Cir. 2008).  The liberal policy of \ngranting leave to amend on Rule 15 equally applies to anti-SLAPP motions styled as motions to \ndismiss. See Maloney v. T3Media, Inc. , 94 F. Supp. 3d 1128, 1140 (C.D. Cal. 2015), aff ’d, 853 \n \n8 In addition to the arguments addressed above , Nunes makes a general allegation that Meredith caused “spoilation” \nof evidence by altering his LinkedIn profile “to downplay his expertise in computer science,” by “scrubbing” his \ncompany’s website from the In ternet, and by deleting his “medium account.” (Oppo. to Strike at 69 -71.) Nunes \nargues the Court should deny Meredith’s motion based on this reason alone; however, he cited no statute, local rule, \nor case law to support his contention. ( Id.) Because Nunes provides no legal basis upon which the Court can grant his \nrequest, the Court will not address this argument. Carmickle v. Comm’r, Soc. Sec. Admin. , 533 F.3d 1155, 1161 n.2 \n(9th Cir. 2008) (courts need not address arguments that are not briefed with specif icity).  Case 1:21-cv-00078-JLT-BAM   Document 22   Filed 06/21/22   Page 18 of 201 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n  \n19  \n \n F.3d 1004 (9th Cir. 2017) (internal quotations omitted) (“[I]t is generally error to grant a \ndefendant ’s anti -SLAPP motion to strike a plaintiff ’s initial complaint without g ranting the \nplaintiff leave to amend.”); see also Sanchez v. Am. Media, Inc. , 2020 WL 8816343, at  *4 (C.D. \nCal. Dec. 29, 2020)  (explaining how “California and federal courts also differ with respect to \ngranting leave to amend if an anti -SLAPP movant succeeds” because federal courts employ a \n“more liberal policy”).  Nunes did not request leave to amend his complaint , however, the Court \n“should grant leave to amend even if no request to amend the pleading was made, unless it \ndetermines that the pleading could not possibly be cured by the allegation of other facts.” Cook, \nPerkiss & Liehe , 911 F.2d  at 247; Perez v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys. , 959 F.3d 334, 340 (9th \nCir. May 11, 2020).  \nAs to Nunes’s stalking claim, if he can submit  with his amended com plaint , independent \ncorroborating evidence to satisfy the statutory requirement under California Civil Code \n§ 1708.7(a)(1) , Nunes may sufficiently state a claim  and a probability of success to  overcome the \nanti-SLAPP motion at the motion to dismiss stage. Therefore, amendment as to the stalking claim \nwould not be futile, and the Court GRANTS leave to amend claim one.  \nRegarding Nunes’s claim for misappropriation, however, the Court finds amendment \nwould be futile. As explained  above, the statutory exemption  under California Civil Code \n§ 3344(d)  bars the misappropriation claim as a matter of law. The basic allegations forming \nNunes’s claim indicate any alleged use of Nunes’s name or likeness bears on a public issue \nbecause Nunes is a po litician in the  public eye. (See Oppo. to Strike at 67-69; Mtn. Strike at 17-\n18.) Regardless of an y additional facts that Nunes may plead, his current allegations, accepted  as \ntrue, revolve around Nunes’s role as a political figure. Any misappropriation of  his identity or \nlikeness in this context  would fall into the public affairs exception under §  3344(d).  Thus , \namendment of additional facts would be futile to remedy Nunes’s commercial misappropriation \nclaim. Serra v. Lappin , 600 F.3d 1191, 1200 (9th Cir. 2010) (leave to amend properly denied as \nfutile where proposed additional facts would still fail to establish a claim  as a matter of law).  \nAccordingly, the Court DISMISSES  with prejudice claim three.

The motion for leave to  conduct specified discovery pursuant to California Civil \nProcedure §  425.16(g) (Doc. 10 -1 at 142 -51) is DENIED . \n3.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves pro se Plaintiff Yasmani Gurri Rubio's multiple unsuccessful attempts to amend his complaint against the District of Columbia and associated officials, alleging the unlawful termination of his D.C.-provided health insurance. The court denied Rubio's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, citing deficiencies in the proposed claims, and dismissed the federal claims with prejudice while declining to exercise jurisdiction over the state law claims. The opinion highlights the use of AI in drafting the complaint, noting several invented legal citations, which contributed to the denial of the complaint amendment.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Plaintiff's proposed second amended complaint presented sufficient, non-conclusory factual allegations to support claims under federal law, specifically under 42 U.S.C § 1983, against the District of Columbia and other named defendants.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Plaintiff's proposed federal claims were futile as they failed to sufficiently remedy previously identified deficiencies, such as failing to demonstrate a pattern of constitutional violations or personal involvement by individual defendants. Consequently, the court denied the motion to file a second amended complaint, dismissed the federal claims with prejudice, and declined supplemental jurisdiction over accompanying state law claims, dismissing them without prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: The person suing said the city unfairly canceled their health insurance and tried multiple times to change their claims. The court found the changes didn't fix the problems and suspected the person used a computer to make up fake law cases. This meant the court didn't let them try to claim the same thing in federal court again, but they can still try on state claims in a different court.",

Plaintiff’s proposed complaint marks his fourth attempt to plead his \nclaims.  For the reasons explained below, the Court will deny Plaintiff’s motion  for leave to file \nan amended complaint , will resolve a host of additional motions that Plaintiff has filed,1 and will \nenter final judgment in favor of Defendants .  \nI. \nThe Court has previously set forth the factual and procedural background relevant to \nPlaintiff’s motion.   See Dkt. 47 at 2 –9, Dkt. 67 at 1 –2.  In brief, Plaintiff brings  this action \nagainst the District of Columbia and three official  capacity  defendants:  D.C. Mayor Muriel \n \n1 These include Plaintiff’s motion for leave to appeal, Dkt . 54, motion for certificate of \nappealability, Dkt. 55, motion for contempt against the Court and the District of Columbia, Dkt. \n56, motion for protective order, Dkt. 58, motion for recusal, Dkt. 59, motion for contempt, Dkt. \n60, motion for certification f or interlocatory  [sic] appeal, Dkt. 61, motion for leave to appeal, \nDkt. 62, motion for writ of mandamus, Dkt. 64, motion for sanctions, Dkt. 68, motion for \nprotective order, Dkt. 69, motion to expedite, Dkt. 77, motion for hearing, Dkt. 80, motion to \ntransfer, Dkt. 82, and mo tion to withdraw pending motions, Dkt. 83.   Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 1 of 12 \n2 \n Bowse r, Laura Green Zeilinger, Director of the D.C. Department of Human Services  (“DHS”) , \nand Wayne Turn age, Director of the D.C. Department of Health Care Finance.  Dkt. 13 -2 at 2 –3 \n(FAC ).  Plaintiff ’s claims generally arise from Defendants’ alleged unlawful  termination of  his \nD.C. -provided health insurance .  \nSeveral month s after filing his initial complaint,  the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for \nleave to file an amended complaint .  Min. Entry (Nov. 29, 2023) ; Dkt. 13 -2.  The  District of \nColumbia then moved to dismiss  Plaintiff’s amended complaint .  Dkt. 22.  In response, Plaintiff \nfiled an opposition and a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, among other \nmotions.  Dkts. 25, 38.  The Court ultimately granted the District’s motion to dismiss and denied \nPlaintiff’s motion  for leave  to file a second amended complaint without prejudice .  Dkt. 47 at \n18.2  \nIn denying Plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint, the Court reasoned that although \nPlaintiff’s proposed complaint was deficient,  “Plaintiff’s arguments merit [ed] further \nexploration —and, if appropriate, further development —with the assistance of counsel.”  Id. at \n28.  The Court, accordingly, “appoint[ed pro bono] counsel to represent Plaintiff” and, in \nparticular, to assess “whether there is a good faith basis to continue to pursue [Plaintiff’s] case in \nfederal district court,” including “whether to fil e a subsequent motion for leave to amend” \nPlaintiff’s complaint.   Id. at 28 –29.  Shortly thereafter, court -appointed pro bono counsel \n \n2 Of the defendants named in Plaintiff’s complaint, Dkt. 13 -2, the District of Columbia is the \nonly one to have entered a  formal  appearance , Dkt. 18 , and  it is unclear whether  the individual  \nDistrict officials were ever properly served, see Dkt. 7 at 3.  This uncertainty is immaterial, \nhowever, for two reasons.  First, t he District’s filings  affirmatively address Plaintiff’s claims \nagainst  both the District and  the individual defendants.  See Dkt. 39 at 6 –10; Dkt. 73 at 11 –12 \n(arguing that qualified immunity would bar Plaintiff’s claims against District officials).  Second , \nas explained below, see infra n.7, Plaintiff’s claims against the individual defendants are so \nlacking in merit that sua sponte  dismissal is, in any event, warranted.   Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 2 of 12 \n3 \n appeared on Plaintiff’s behalf.  See Dkts . 52, 53.  But Plaintiff declined representation and \nelected to continue pro se .  See Dkt. 57 at 2.  \nII. \nPlaintiff then filed a series of motion s, some of which evinced a desire to appeal his case.  \nSee, e.g. , Dkt . 61 (motion for certification for interlocutory  appeal ); Dkt. 62 (motion for leave to \nappeal) .  The Court, however, had dismissed Plaintiff’s operative complaint and denied his \nmotion for leave to file a second amended complaint without  prejudice.  Dkt. 47.  Because there \nwas no operative complaint, the Court issued an order giving Plaintiff a choice:  Plaintiff could \neither renew his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, or the Court could enter \nfinal judgment in favor of the District of Co lumbia, thereby allowing Plaintiff to appeal.  Dkt. 67 \nat 4.  Several hours after the Court issued its order , Plaintiff filed a proposed second amended \ncomplaint, which the Court construes as a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.  \nSee Min. Order (Oct. 28, 2024) ; Dkt. 70 .  Because Plaintiff declined the Court’s offer to enter \nfinal judgment and, instead, sought leave to file a second amended complaint, the Court will \ndeny Plaintiff’s motions for leave to appeal , Dkt. 54, for a certificate of  appealability , Dkt. 55, \nfor certification for interlocutory appeal , Dkt. 61, and for leave to appeal , Dkt. 62.3  At the time \nPlaintiff filed these motions, the Court had yet to enter final judgment, see 28 U.S.C. §  1291, and \nPlaintiff failed to identify any “controlling question of law as to which there is substantial found \nfor difference of opinion,” id. § 1292(b).  \nPlaintiff has also —once again —renewed his motion for recusal, Dkt. 59, and has —\nadding a new twist —moved for transfer to “a district court in Florida” “due to judicial bias, \n \n3 The Court will also deny Plaintiff’s  petition for a writ of mandamus , Dkt. 64,  which  he \napparently incorrectly filed in this Court  rather than in the Court of Appeals.  Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 3 of 12 \n4 \n retaliation, and lack of impartiality,” Dkt. 82 at 1, 5.  In support of those motions, Plaintiff points \nto the Court’s notification of  counsel for the District of Columbia Department of Human \nServices that a default judgment had been entered against it and to the Court’s decision to set \naside that judgment after the District appeared.  The Court has previously explained why recusal \nis no t warranted under these circumstances , and it need not repeat that explanation here.   See \nDkt. 47 at 31; Dkt. 67 at 3 n.4.   Suffice it to say that l itigation is not a game of gotcha in which a \nplaintiff is entitled to an unyielding default judgment, when little time has passed since the suit \nwas filed, the delay has not caused the plaintiff undue prejudice, the defendant stands ready to \ndefend the sui t, and the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can granted —and this \nis particularly so when  the court is responsible for effecting service of process on behalf of a pro \nse plaintiff, and  it is unclear whether the al legedly defaulting defendant has received actual \nnotice of the suit or of the Clerk’s entry of default.4  The Court, accordingly, will deny Plaintiff’s \nrenewed motion for recusal and motion to transfer .    \nPlaintiff also filed a motion to expedite , Dkt. 77, and a motion for a hearing , Dkt. 80, but \nsubsequently filed an emergency motion to withdraw the two motions, Dkt. 83.  The Court will \ngrant that motion and will treat Plaintiff’s motion to expedite and motion for a hearing as \nwithdrawn.  And the Court will deny Plaintiff’s motion for sanctions against Defendants , Dkt. \n \n4 For similar reasons, the Court will also deny Plaintiff’s two motion s to hold the Court in \ncontempt, which repeat his allegations of bias, assert that the Court abused its discretion by \nappointing pro bono counsel, and unjustifiably denied Plaintiff’s request the Court sanction \nDefendants’ counsel, Dkt s. 56, 60, and his two motions for protective orders , which ask that the \nCourt re -enter the default against Defendants, revoke its Memorandum Opinion of July 12, 2024, \n“ensure that Plaintiff receives fair and impartial treatment in all future proceedings related to this \ncase,” reimburse Plaintiff for “legal  fees, travel expenses, administrative costs, and other related \nexpenses that have been unnecessarily burdened on Plaintiff due to the Court’s actions or \ninactions,” and “appoint a neutral third party .  . . to oversee any future actions or proceedings in \nthis case,” Dkt. 58  at 17 –19; Dkt. 69. Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 4 of 12 \n5 \n 68, which itself  fails to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and which, in any event, \nfails to identify any sanctionable misconduct.  \nIII. \nThis, then, brings the Court to the only substantial question presented —that is, whether \nthe Court should grant Plaintiff leave to file a second amended complaint.  In his proposed \nsecond amended complaint, Dkt. 70, Plaintiff now advances  eighteen  federal and state law \nclaims against the District of Columbia; Mayor Muriel Bowser; Wayne Turnage, Director of the \nDepartment of Health Care Finance (DHCF); an unnamed “Manager of the D.C. Healthcare \nAlliance Program;” an unnamed “Eligibility Review Supervisor at DHCF;” an unnamed \n“Director of the Economic Security Administration at DHS”; an unnamed Case Management \nSupervisor at DHS; and MedStar Family Choice, Inc.  Dkt. 70 at 1.    \n After a party has amended its complaint “once as a matter of course” pursuant to Rule \n15(a)(1), the party  may further amend only “with the opposing party’s written consent or the \ncourt’s leave.”  Fed R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).  Although courts “should freely give leave [to amend] \nwhen justice so requires,” id., courts  should consider,  among other things, “ repeated failure to \ncure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by \nvirtue of allowance of the amendment, [and] fu tility of amendment,” Mahon  v. Anesthesia Bus. \nConsultants, LLC , 2016 WL 1452333, at *9 (D.D.C. Apr . 13, 2016) (quoting  Harris  v. Sec’y, \nU.S. Dep’t of Veterans Affs. , 126 F.3d 339, 344 (D.C. Cir. 1997) ).  The Court “may deny a \nmotion to amend a complaint as futile  . . . if the proposed claim would not survive a motion to \ndismiss.”  James Madison Ltd.  v. Ludwig , 82 F.3d 1085, 1099 (D.C. Cir. 1996).   Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 5 of 12 \n6 \n A. Federal Claims  \nAfter reviewing Plaintiff’s proposed second amended complaint, the Court concludes that \namendment would be futile because Plaintiff failed to cure the deficiencies that the Court \npreviously identified.  As relevant here, Plaintiff’s prior proposed complaint asserted claims \nagainst the District under 42 U.S.C § 1983.  See Dkt. 38 -2 at 40 ( Prior Proposed SAC ¶¶  123–\n24).  Plaintiff advanced a Monell theory of liability  based on  the District’s termination of his \nmedical benefits.   See Dkt. 47 at 21.   As the Cou rt’s prior opinion explained,  however, Monell \nrequires both a predicate constitutional violation in Plaintiff’s case and “a pattern of similar \nconstitutional violations”  in other cases .  Dkt. 47 at 21  (quoting Hurd v. District of Columbia , \n997 F.3d 332, 338 (D.C. Cir. 2021) ).  Plaintiff’s prior proposed amended complaint failed in this \nrespect because it “d[id] not identify  any similar incident preceding the termination of his \nmedical benefits.”  Id. (emphasis in original).5  Plaintiff attempted to show prior similar incidents \nby pointing to various federal and state court decisions from the District of Columbia, but none \nof those cases addressed conduct that was “‘facially similar’ to the predicate violations that \nPlaintiff a llege[d].”  Id. at 22.  The Court also rejected Plaintiff’s claims directed at the \nindividual capacity defendants.   As the Court explained, Plaintiff was required to “plead that \neach Government -official defendant, through the official’s own individual actions , has violated \nthe Constitution.”   Dkt. 47 at 24 (emphasis in original) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, \n676 (2009) ).  Aside from a few conclusory allegations, Plaintiff did not “allege[] that any of the \n \n5 Plaintiff’s prior complaint relied on an additional Monell theory , under  which a municipality \ncan be held liable for the unconstitutional action of “a policy maker within the government.”   \nDkt. 47 at 23 (quoting Baker v. District of Columbia , 326 F.3d 1302 , 1306 (D.C. Cir. 2003)).  \nThis theory does not require pleading a pattern of constitutional violations , see City of St. Louis \nv. Praprotnik , 485 U.S. 112, 123 –30 (1988) , but Plaintiff’s proposed second amended complaint \ndoes not appear to raise it.   Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 6 of 12 \n7 \n individual capacity Defendants was ‘personally involved in the illegal conduct.’”  Id. at 25 \n(quoting Simpkins v. District of Columbia Gov’t , 108 F.3d 366, 369 (D.C. Cir. 1997)).  \nPlaintiff’s proposed second amended complaint suffers from th ese same defect s.  As for \nPlaintiff’s Monell claims  against the District , Plaintiff alleges , as before,  that the District  violated \nthe Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses by “[f]ailing to provide adequate notice regarding \nthe termination of his health benefits” and “[d]enying him  the opportunity to appeal ” or have a \nhearing on  the termination  of his benefits .  Dkt. 70 at 40 (Proposed SAC ¶¶  163–64); see also id. \nat 44, 49, 55 –57 (Proposed SAC ¶¶  196, 230, 277 , 284, 293 ).  But Plaintiff  fails to make any \nnon-conclusory allegation that the District has engaged in a pattern of arbitrarily canceling \nresidents’ healthcare wit hout proper notification  and denying those residents ’ appeals  or \nhearings .  See, e.g. , Dkt. 70 at 7 (Proposed SAC ¶  13) (alleging that Plaintiff’s case “ is not an \nisolated incident but reflects a systematic pattern of conduct”).  As in his prior proposed second \namended complaint, see Dkt. 38 -2 at 22 –24 (Prior Proposed SAC ¶¶  57–61), Plaintiff  attempts to \nmeet this requirement by  point ing to a host of federal and state decisions  purporting to involve  \nMonell claims against the District , see Dkt. 70 at 8–12 (Proposed SAC at ¶¶  13–31).  But , again,  \nthese cases cannot establish a “widespread practice or custom” of the unconstitutional conduct \nPlaintiff alleges .  Hurd , 997 F.3d at 338.  To the extent the District was even held liable in t he \ncases Plaintiff cites , they addressed conduct that “bear[s] little resemblance” to this case.  Id.; \nsee, e.g. , Dkt. 70 at 11 (Proposed SAC at ¶  25) (citing Goodwin v. District of Columbia , 579 F. \nSupp. 3d 159 , 162  (D.D.C. 2021), which addressed protesters’ First and Fourth Amendment \nMonell claims against the District).    \nMoreover , many of the cases that Plaintiff  cites appear to have been invented by artificial \nintelligence  (“AI”) .  Plaintiff apparently used  AI to draft his proposed complaint , which  bears Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 7 of 12 \n8 \n some of the hallmarks of a n AI response to a user’s inquiry.  For example, following a list of \nseemingly fabricated cases,6 Plaintiff’s proposed complaint states:  “This case supports your \nargument that MedStar’s failure to inform you about your coverage cancellation and your rights \nconstitutes a violation of patient protection laws.”  Dkt. 70 at 10 (Proposed SAC ¶  22).  The \ncomplaint continues:  “Here are some relevant legal precedents from the District of Columbia \nthat can help establish the non -isolated nature of the conduct in your case.”  Id. at 11 (Proposed \nSAC ¶  24).  To be sure, there is no prohibition on using AI in this District, and the Court \nappreciates that it may be a valuable tool for pro se litigants in particular.  Nonetheless, all \nlitigants have an obligation to comply with Rule 11, which imposes an affirmative duty  to \nconduct a “reasonable [inquiry]”  into the substance of a filing before it is presented to the Court , \nincluding verifying that every citation is real .  Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2) ; accord Mata v. Avianca, \nInc., 678 F.  Supp.  3d 443, 460 (S.D.N.Y. 2023) .  The failure to do so is an “abuse of the judicial \nsystem ,” Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp. , 496 U.S. 384, 398 (1990) , leading some courts to \nimpose Rule 11 sanctions  for the improper use of AI assistance , see, e.g. , Mata , 678 F. Supp. 3d \nat 466.   \nNext, construing Plaintiff’s proposed second amended complaint liberally, Plaintiff \nappears to assert  essentially  the same  § 1983 claim s under the Due Process  and Equal Protection \nClauses  against the individual  defendants  and MedStar Health (a private corporation) .  See Dkt. \n70 at 48 –50 (Proposed SAC ¶¶  229–40) (defendants “ fail[ed] to ensure adequate healthcare \nservices , constituting a violation of the Due Process Clause” ); id. at 55 (Proposed SAC ¶¶  275-\n \n6 The Court is unable to locate Ford v. District of Columbia , 70 F.3d 231 (D.C. Cir. 1995), Davis \nv. District of Columbia , 817 A.2d 1234 (D.C. 2003), Ward v. District of Columbia , 818 A.2d 27 \n(D.C. 2003), or Reese v. District of Columbia , 37 A.3d 232 (D.C. 2012).  Dkt. 70  at 9, 10, 52 \n(Proposed SAC at ¶¶  18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 255).  Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 8 of 12 \n9 \n 82) (equal protection); id. at 55 –57 (Proposed SAC ¶¶  283–98) (defendants “denied the plaintiff \na fair hearing regarding the termination of his medical benefits ” and “fail[ed] to provide adequate \nnotification of his rights” ).  These allegations, however, cannot sustain any §  1983 claim against  \neither  the individual defendants  or MedStar .   \nWith respect to the individual s, Plaintiff ’s newest proposed complaint  again  fails to \ninclude  any non -conclusory allegation that the individuals  did anything at all , let alone \nallegations that,  through their “ own individual actions ,” they “ violated the Constitution.”  Dkt. \n47 at 24 (emphasis in original) (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 676).  Plaintiff ’s claim, for example, \nthat Mayor Bowser (along with the other defendants) “administered” D.C. Healthcare Alliance \ndoes not suffice.  Dkt. 70 at 49 (Proposed SAC ¶  230).  Plaintiff’s constitutional claims against \nMedStar fare no better.  Even assuming Med Star c an be held liable  for unconstitutional conduct  \nas a state actor , MedStar would be subject to the same municipal liability standards as the \nDistrict.  See Jordan v. District of Columbia , 949 F.Supp.2d 83 , 90 (D.D.C. 2013) .  And, again, \nPlaintiff fails adequately to allege a “pattern” of similar constitutional violations by MedStar.   \nLike his claims against the District, Plaintiff attempts to support  his claim that MedStar engaged \nin “a troubling pattern” of violations  by citing numerous state and federal decisions .  Dkt. 70 at 9 \n(Proposed SAC ¶¶  17–19).  As explained above,  however,  these cases  either involved \nconstitutional violations that bear no resemblance to Plaintiff’s claims,  did not involve any \nconstitutional violations,  or appear to be miscited  or invented .  \nB. D.C. Law Claims  \nPlaintiff also asserts numerous D.C. statutory  and common law claims against \nDefendants.   Dkt. 70 at 30–54 (Proposed SAC ¶¶  99–274).  As to those claims, Plaintiff seeks to \ninvoke the Court’s supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1367 , which permits the Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 9 of 12 \n10 \n Court to hear state law claims that “ form part of the same case or controversy ” as the federal \nclaims .  28 U.S.C. §  1367(a).  Supplemental jurisdiction, however, is “a doctrine of discretion .”  \nUnited Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs , 383 U.S. 715, 72 6 (1966).   A court may  “decline to \nexercise supplemental jurisdiction” when, for example, “the claim raises a novel or complex \nissue of State law;” “the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which \nthe district court has original jurisdiction;” or “ the district court has dismissed all claims over \nwhich it has original jurisdiction .”  28 U.S.C. §  1367(c) .  Courts should consider, moreover, \n“judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants .”  Gibbs , 383 U.S. at 726.   Here, not \nonly has the Court concluded  that granting Plaintiff leave to amend his federal claims would be \nfutile,  but twelve of the eighteen counts in Plaintiff’s propose d second amended complaint arise \nunder D.C. law.  The Court, accordingly,  declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction to \nconsider the viability of Plaintiff’s proposed state law claims.    \nIV. \n The only remaining question is how to resolve this matter .  The Court previously \ndismissed Plaintiff’s operative  complaint, Dkt. 47 at 32, but did not dismiss the underlying case, \nsee Ciralsky v. Central Intelligence Agency , 355 F.3d 661 , 666–67 (D.C.  Cir. 2004)  \n(distinguishing between dismissal of a complaint  without prejudice , which is not appealable, and \ndismissal of the case, which is  appealable whether dismissed with or without prejudice ).  \nDismissal of a case with prejudice may be warranted  where a plaintiff is given multiple \nopportunities to amend his complaint, yet repeatedly fails to state a claim.  See Brown v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth. , 164 F. Supp. 3d 33 , 35 (D.D.C. 2016) .  At this juncture,  \nin light of  Plaintiff’s repeated failures adequately to plead his claims,  the Court will dismiss Case 1:23-cv-00719-RDM     Document 88     Filed 12/03/24     Page 10 of 12 \n11 \n Plaintiff’s federal law claims with prejudice.  The Court expresses no view, however, about the \nmerits of Plaintiff’s D.C. law claims, over which the Court simply decline s jurisdiction .7 \nCONCLUSION  \nPlaintiff’s motion for leave to file a  second amended complaint , Dkt. 70, will be  denied .  \nThe Court will dismiss Plaintiff’s federal claims with prejudice for failure to state a claim  and \nwill decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his D.C. law claims , which the Court will \ndismiss without prejudice .   \nThe Court will also deny  Plaintiff’s motion for leave to appeal, Dkt. 54, motion for \ncertificate of appealability, Dkt. 55, motion for contempt against the Court and the District of \nColumbia, Dkt. 56, motion for protective order, Dkt. 58, motion for recusal, Dkt. 59, motion for \ncontempt, Dkt.  60, motion for certification for i nterloc utory appeal, Dkt. 61, motion for leave to \nappeal, Dkt. 62, motion for writ of mandamus, Dkt. 64, motion for sanctions, Dkt. 68 , motion for \nprotective order, Dkt. 69, and motion  to transfer , Dkt. 82 .  The Court will grant Plaintiff’s motion \nto withdraw pending motions, Dkt. 83, and will treat his motion to expedite, Dkt. 77, and motion \nfor hearing, Dkt. 80, as withdrawn.  \nA separate order shall issue.  \n \n7 Although it is unclear whether the individual defendants have appeared in the case , see supra \nn.2, the Court may nonetheless sua sponte dismiss the claims against them pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6) .  See, e.g. , Pricer v. Deutsche Bank , 842 F. Supp. 2d 162 , 166 –68 (D.D.C. 2012)  \n(dismissing claims against appearing defendants on their motion and dismissing claims against \nnon-appearing defendants sua sponte ); Moore v. Motz , 437 F.Supp.2d 88, 94 (D.D.C.  2006)  \n(dismissing complaint against non -appearing defendants sua sponte  (citing Best v. Kelly , 39 F.3d \n328, 331 (D.C.  Cir. 1994) ).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Plaintiff Kevin Meehan seeking to remand his lawsuit against VIPKid and affiliates back to New York state court, after it was removed to federal court by the defendants under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA). The Plaintiff alleges fraud and improper use of his and other teachers' likenesses to develop AI technology, alongside employment-related violations. The court ultimately recommends denying the remand request, as the defendants have demonstrated CAFA jurisdiction adequately, and the Plaintiff has not met the burden to demonstrate an exception applies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the case should be remanded back to state court due to exceptions under CAFA or via abstention doctrines despite federal jurisdiction being claimed under CAFA and federal question jurisdiction stemming from an FLSA claim.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court recommends the denial of Plaintiff's motion to remand the case back to state court, finding that federal jurisdiction under CAFA is established, and the plaintiff has not sufficiently proved the applicability of any CAFA exception or valid grounds for abstention.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Kevin Meehan, a teacher, sues VIPKid for fraud and using his digital likeness without consent, claiming it helped them make robots (AI). He wants the case tried in New York, but VIPKid moved it to federal court, saying federal rules allow it. He asked the court to send it back to New York, but the court said it should stay in federal court because VIPKid followed the proper rules for keeping it there.",

KATHLEEN TOMLINSON, Magistrate Judge:  \n \nI. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT  \n Defendant VIPKid International, Inc. (“ VIPKid Int’l. ”) removed this putative class and \ncollective action  to the Eastern District of New York pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act \nof 2005 (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1332( d).  See Notice of Removal of Civil Action from State \nCourt [DE 1].  Defendant Sequoia Capital Operations, LLC (“Sequoia Capital ”) filed a Notice of \nConsent to VIPKid Int’l. ’s removal and noted the existence of additional grounds for federal \njurisdiction under the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq.   See Notice Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 1 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n of Joinder In and Consent to Removal and Statement of Additional Ground by Defendant \nSequoia Capital [DE 7].  \nPlaintiff Kevin Meehan  (“Plaintiff”) now moves to remand this action to the Supreme \nCourt of the State of New York, County of Nassau, where it was originally filed.  See Legal Memorandum In Support (“Pl.’s Mem.”) [DE 46];  Plaintiff’s Response to Defendants’ Joint \nOpposition to Re mand (“Pl.’s Reply”) [DE 49].  Plaintiff argues his FLSA claim is an \ninsufficient standalone basis to confer federal jurisdiction and that the Court should exercise its discretion to remand pursuant to CAFA.  See generally Pl.’s Mem.; Pl.’s Reply.  Defenda nts \nVIPKid Int’l. , VIPKID HK Ltd., VIPKID Class HK Ltd., Beijing Dami Technology Co., Ltd., \nVIPTeach Inc., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Tencent America LLC, Tencent Cloud LLC, China Renaissance Holdings Ltd., and Sequoia Capital Operations,LLC (collectively, “De fendants”\n 1), \njointly oppose Plaintiff’s motion and argue that the Court has original jurisdiction based upon \nPlaintiff’s FLSA claim and that the Court cannot exercise its discretion to remand pursuant to \nCAFA based upon the circumstances of this case.  See Defendants’ Joint Opposition to \nPlaintiff’s Motion to Remand (“Defs.’ Opp’n”) [DE 48] at 4- 9. \n The Honorable Joanna Seybert referred Plaintiff’s motion to this Court for a Report and \nRecommendation as to whether the motion should be granted.  See May 5, 2021 Electronic Order.  For the reasons which follow, the Court respectfully recommends to Judge Seybert that \nPlaintiff’s motion to remand be DENIED.  \n \n \n1  There are 13 entities named as defendants in this case and Defendants’ opposition \nto Plaintiff’s motion to remand was submitted on behalf of all but three of these entities , namely,  \nBeijing Dami Future Technology Co., Ltd., VIPKid and Cloud & Smart Industries.  See Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 1 n.1.  Defendants then appear to explain that these three entities did not join in the \nopposition because, according to Defendants, Beijing Dami Future Technology Co., Ltd was not properly served and VIPKid and Cloud & Smart Industries “are not juridical entities.”  Id.   \n Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 2 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n II. BACKGROUND  \n A. The Complaint  \nOn November 13, 2020, Plaintiff commenced this action in the Supreme Court of the \nState of New York, County of Nassau, against Defendant VIPKid HK Limited (“VIPKid HK”) \nand a dozen entities that are related to or in some fashion affiliated with VIPKid HK.  See generally Complaint (“Compl.”) [DE 1- 1].\n2  According to the Complaint, Defendants are \naffiliated with or responsible for operating VIPKid, an online  education platform which  \nfacilitates the instruction of English language skills by teachers from the United States and Canada to students in China.  Id.   VIPKid’s operation connects approximately 700,000 students \nwith more than 100,000 teachers.  Id.  ¶¶ 20-21.  The Complaint alleges the VIPKid enterprise is \nNew York -based and whose services are provided by entities domiciled in New York.  Id. ¶ 11.  \nHowever, the Complaint then alleges that even if these entities, i.e. , the Defendants, are \nconsidered to be domiciled outside of New York, their activities and interactions within the State satisfy jurisdictional requirements pursuant to C.P.L.R. § 302.  Id . ¶ 12.   \nPlaintiff, a New York resident, contracted with VIPKid Hk and VIPKid Int’l.  to provide \nservices teaching English to children in China.  Id.  ¶¶ 15 -16, 34, 85.  Plaintiff claims that over \nthe course of his four -year employment with VIPKid, he was “ living in an Orweillian nightmare \n[and] realize[d] that he had been the victim of a sophisticated fraud deliberately crafted to exploit \npeople like him —Americans in search of affordable paths to dignified careers.”  Id.  ¶ 6. He \nasserts 10 causes of action arising under state and federal law on behalf of himself and all current \nand former VIPKid teachers.  Plaintiff’s first two causes of action are for common law fraud and \n \n2  Plaintiff’s Complaint is 92 -pages long and contains more than 600 paragraphs of \nallegations.  See generally Compl.  The “ Background”  information set forth here is limited to the \nfacts necessary to resolve the instant motion.   \n Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 3 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n fraudulent inducement.   Id. ¶¶ 393- 444.  These claims are based upon statements on VIP Kid’s \nwebsite concerning the terms and conditions of employment for online  teachers.  T he  Complaint \nlists more than 20 such statements which , for example, pertain to VIPKid’s mission  to provide \nChinese children an elementary school experience from the com fort of their own homes , the \nability for teachers to set their own schedule s and flexible hours, job perks, base pay rates, \nearnings calculations, contract lengths, and the low level of commitment required to be a VIPKid \nteacher, among other things.  Id.  ¶ 395.  Plaintiff alleges that he and the Class were induced to \nwork as VIPKid teachers based upon these statements which proved to be false.  Plaintiff’s third \ncause of action, a violation of N.Y. General Business Law § 349 based on unlawful and deceptive business practices, also stems from allegedly false and misleading advertising campaigns run by the Defendants.  Id.  ¶¶ 445- 57.  Plaintiff then asserts an independent cause of \naction for conspiracy, alleging the Defendants committed various overt acts related to Plaintiff’s fraud claims.  Id.  ¶¶ 469- 78.   \nNext, Plaintiff claims Defendants violated N.Y. Civil Rights Law §§ 50- 51 because \nDefendants exploited Class members’ “names, portraits, pictures, images, and/or voices to develop, e nhance, or inform its artificial intelligence technology  . . . without the knowledge or \nconsent of any VIPKid Teachers.”  See id.  ¶¶ 460, 462.  Defendants then utilized  this artificial \nintelligence to replace live instruction.  Id.  ¶ 464.  As a result of D efendants utilizing Class \nmembers’ images and likenesses  without their consent , Plaintiff also claims  that the Defendants \nwere unjustly enriched.  See id.  ¶¶ 479 -83.   \nPlaintiff also asserts a variety of claims concerning the conditions of his employment, \nnamely, FLSA and NYLL violations, on behalf of a collective which is defined as “all current and former VIPKid Teachers.”  Id.  ¶¶ 485 -86.  Regarding the FLSA violations, Plaintiff alleges , Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 4 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n among other things, that  the Defendants failed to (1) pay minimum w ages, (2) overtime \ncompensation, (3) compensation for on- call time, (4) undercounted hours worked, (5) did not \nprovide rest or meal breaks or permit Collective  members to accept tips, and (6) failed to \nmaintain records and post required notices on the VIPK id website concerning wage and hour  \nlaws.  Id.  ¶¶ 515 -37.  The Plaintiff’s NYLL claims are, for the most part, analogous to the claims \nasserted  under the FLSA.  See id.  ¶¶ 538 -65.  However, Plaintiff also sets forth causes of action \npursuant to NYLL  § 215 and § 740 for retaliation.  See id.  ¶¶ 566 -606.  These retaliation claims \nare brought on behalf of a sub- class of the C ollective  which Plaintiff refers to as the “VIPKid \nWhistleblower Class.”  Id. ¶¶ 566, 602.  Plaintiff alleges that he was denied me aningful \nopportunities for advancement within VIPKid and ultimately was fired after complaining about \nthe company’s employment practices.  See id.  ¶¶ 566-606.   \n B. Procedural Background  \nOn December 30, 2020, VIPKids Int ’l. removed the  action to this Court  pursuant to \nCAFA.  See DE 1.  Sequoia Capital filed a N otice of J oinder and consented to the removal by \nVIPKids Int.  See DE 7.  In its notice, Sequoia Capital also stated that, in addition to CAFA, federal jurisdiction exists based upon Plaintiff’s cause  of action under the FLSA.  Id.  at 2.  The \nTencent Defendants  (i.e., Tencent America LLC, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Cloud & Smart \nIndustries, Tencent Holdings Ltd. a/k/a Cloud & Smart Industries at Tencent Holdings Ltd., and Tencent Cloud LLC ) filed a “notice  of joinder in and consent to removal” for the reasons \nproffered by VIPKids Int. and Sequoia Capital.  See DE 15.  W ithin their notice, the Tencent \nDefendants also contend that they were not properly served with the Summons and Complaint.  See id.  & n.1.  T he VIPKid Defendants, i.e. , VIPKids Int ’l., VIPKid HK, VIPKID Class HK Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 5 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n Limited, Beijing Dami Technology Co., Ltd. and VIPTeach, Inc., also joined Sequoia Capital’s \nnotice related to the FLSA grounds  for removal.  See DE 20.   \nBetween January 22, 2021 and February 5, 2021, the VIPKid Defendants, the Tencent \nDefendants, Sequoia Capital, and China Renaissance Holdings Ltd. each filed separate pre -\nmotion conference requests to Judge Seybert for purposes of making a motion to dismiss.  See DE 29; DE 39; DE  40; DE 41.  On January 29, 2021, Plaintiff filed opposition to the VIPKid \nDefendants’ pre -motion conference request.  See DE 36.  In this opposition, Plaintiff noted he \nwould be seeking remand to state court and attached as an exhibit  to this letter  his l egal \nmemorandum in support of a  motion to remand.  Id.; DE 36 -1.  The VIPKid Defendants and \nSequoia Capital asked Judge Seybert to set a briefing schedule for Plaintiff’s motion to remand.  See DE 37; DE 38.  \nOn February 18, 2021, Judge Seybert issued the f ollowing Order regarding the Defendants’ \npre-motion conference requests and the Plaintiff’s opposition:  \nIn conjunction with his objection ( see ECF No. 36\n (hereafter, the \n“Objection Letter ”)) to the Letter Motion of [the VIPKid \nDefendants]  . . . seeking a pre -motion conference regarding a \nproposed dismissal motion ( see ECF No. 29 ), Plaintiff filed a \ntimely Motion to Remand. ( See EC F No. [36- 1] (hereafter, the \n“Remand Motion”); see also  ECF No. 36- 2 (Mem. of Supp. \nFacts).) The VIPKid Defendants oppose remand and request the \nCourt set a briefing schedule on the Remand Motion. ( See ECF \nNo. 37.) Defendant Sequoia Capital Operations LLC. similarly requests the Court set a briefing schedule on said Motion. ( See \nECF No. 38.)  \n Pursuant to the Court ’s inherent authority to manage its docket \nwith a “ view toward the efficient and expedient resolution of \ncases, ” Dietz v. Bouldin, U.S., 136 S. Ct. 1885, 1892 (2016):  \n (1) Plaintiff ’s Remand Motion (ECF No. [36- 1]) filed as an \nattachment to his Objection Letter is deemed to have been filed as a separate,  stand -alone motion;  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 6 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n  \n(2) For clarity on the Case Docket, the Clerk of Court is directed to file (a) the Remand Motion (ECF No. [36 -1]) as a separate docket \nentry, with a filing date of January 29, 2021, and (b) Plaintiff's Memorandum of Supporting Facts (ECF No. [36- 2]) as an \nattachment thereto;  \n (3) Any Defendant seeking to file a response to the Remand Motion shall do so by no later than March 26, 2021;  \n (4) Plaintiff shall have until April 16, 2021 to file replies, if any; and \n (5) The Defendants ’ various pre -conference Letter Motions \nregarding proposed dismissal motions (see ECF Nos. 29, 39, 40, and 41) are denied as premature and without prejudice to renew pending the final determination of the Remand Motion.  \nSee February 18, 2021 Electronic Order.  In accordance with Judge Seybert’s Order, Plaintiff’s \nmotion to remand and legal memorandum in support w ere re-docketed at DE 46, dated  \nJanuary 29, 2021.  See Pl.’s Mem.   Defendants filed a joint opposition to Plaintiff’s motion on \nMarch 26, 2021.  See Defs.’ Opp’n.  Plaintiff submitted a reply brief on April 16, 2021.  See Pl.’s \nReply.  Plaintiff’s motion was  then  referred to this Court for this  Report and Recommendation on \nMay 5, 2021.  C. The Parties’ Positions   \n  1. Plaintiff’s Motion  \n Plaintiff first argues that this Court does not have federal question jurisdiction because \nhis FLSA claims “do not present a necessary federal question.”  See Pl.’s Mem. at 4.  Plaintiff contends that the FLSA is the only federal law invoked by the Complai nt and that it “is invoked \nmerely as an alternative theory of recovery for injuries caused to Plaintiff” as a result of VIPKid’s alleged fraudulent scheme which is pled “in the context of a state law theory of recovery founded entirely in New York common l aw fraud.”  Id.  at 5.  Shifting then to a Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 7 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n discussion of CAFA , Plaintiff seems to insist that “CAFA requires agreement on the existence of \na class action.”  Id.  at 6.  Plaintiff goes on to state that his “mere allegation of a class action could \nnot have suf ficed for removal  . . . on the basis of original jurisdiction.”   However, Plaintiff \nasserts that because Defendants have raised CAFA as such a basis for removal, “they agree this \nAction is a class action  . . . [and] implicitly and irreversibly accept the e xistence of a class \naction.”  Id.   Plaintiff then appears to concede that the Court has jurisdiction as a result of CAFA \nand Defendants “must litigate this Action as a class -action in open court.”  Id. at 7.   \n Having posited that argument, Plaintiff submits that he is entitled to discovery to verify \nthat CAFA jurisdiction exists .  However, he then immediately goes into a discussion regarding \nthe application of exceptions to CAFA jurisdiction which would warrant remand.  See id.  8-15.  \nTo demonstrate one exception to the applicability of CAFA here, P laintiff casts doubt  upon the \nveracity of his  own allegations in the Complaint which state that VIPKid employs over 100,000 \nteachers  in light of VIPKid’s LinkedIn page which apparently indicates that figure is cl oser to \n13,000.  Id.  at 10.  Plaintiff also notes that “[t]he highest concentration of VIPKid workers who \nname VIPKid on their LinkedIn profile identify as being located in the New York City area” and that “[t]he number of  . . . teachers in New York State is likely far higher.”  Id.  Based on this \ninformation, Plaintiff contends that “it is more likely than not that one or more CAFA exception applies.”  Id.   Consequently, Plaintiff asks for discovery to determine the total number of VIPKid \nteachers “by domi cile per state in the United States,” but adds that if the Defendants cannot \nprovide such information, then the Court should remand the case.  Id.   \n Plaintiff then argues that “[a]ssuming  [CAFA’s] numerical requirements are satisfied,” \nthe Court should exercise its discretion to remand under CAFA’s “interests of justice” exception.  \nId. at 11.  In making this argument, Plaintiff asserts that :  (1) his claims involve matters of Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 8 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n national and interstate interest that can only be addressed at the state- level; (2) his claims are \ngoverned only by the laws of the State of New York; (3) the Complaint was not pled to avoid \nfederal law; (4) the action was originally filed in a forum with a distinct n exus to the class \nmembers, the alleged harm, and the Defendants; (5) the proposed classes are comprised of more citizens from New York than any other state; and (6) no other class actions asserting the same or similar claims were filed against the Defendan ts.  Id. at 11 -15.  In addition to the “interest of \njustice” exception to CAFA, Plaintiff also contends that there are grounds to remand this case based on the Pullman and Burford abstention doctrines.  Id.  at 15 -17.  Lastly, Plaintiff argues \nthat because “[t]his case presents a mixture of national and state interests,” if the Court retains \njurisdiction “over Plaintiff’s singular duplicative federal labor law cause of action,” it “should not hesitate to remand all of Plaintiffs [sic] state claims.”  Id.  at 17- 18.   \nIn his conclusion section, Plaintiff st ates that “this [C]ourt has jurisdiction for class -based \nadjudication only” pursuant to CAFA and essentially argues that “this Court risks upsetting the \ndelicate balance between federal and state power if it chooses to maintain jurisdiction under any other conditions.”  Id.  at 18 -19.  Plaintiff then recommends a  “course of action” for the Court to \ntake, which sets forth three scenarios:  (1) “i f this Court finds that Defendants must admit \nthis . . . is a class  action, then the Court must litigate this  . . . as a class action”; (2) if the Court \nhas doubts as to CAFA jurisdiction, an order for expedited discovery on the proposed class and citizenship of the Defendants should be issued; or (3) the Court should rem and this case “[i]n all \nother circumstances.”  Id. at 19. \n  2. Defendants’ Opposition  \n At the outset , Defendants argue that they have met their burden to establish CAFA \njurisdiction and that the Complaint provides the reasonable probability needed to do so.  See Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 9 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n Defs.’ Opp’n at 4.  Defendants draw the Court’s attention to the allegations which assert:  (1) a \nclass of 100,000 members; (2) damages of nearly $13,000,000 for Plaintiff alone; and (3) diversity of citizenship between Plaintiff, a New York resident, and the primary Defendant VIPKids Int ’l.  See id.  (citing Compl. ¶¶  9, 14, 181).  Regarding the citizenship of VIPKids Int ’l., \nDefendants cite the Declaration of Huan Xiong, counsel for VIPKid Int’l. , which asserts that this \nentity is a Delaware corporation with its  principal place of business in California.  See \nDeclaration of Huan Xiong (“Xiong Decl.”) [DE 48- 2].  Defendants then argue that because \nCAFA jurisdiction exists, there is federal jurisdiction over the entire action.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 4-5.  Although Plaintiff seems to have suggested that removal was improper to the extent it was \nbased on Plaintiff’s allegations regarding the number of VIPKid teachers, Defendants submit that it is routine for defendants to remove actions based on allegations in complaints.  Id.  at 5 (citing \nBlockbuster, Inc. v. Galeno, 472 F.3d 53, 56- 57 (2d Cir. 2006)).  Moreover, to the extent \nPlaintiff argues that the mere fact that the Court has CAFA jurisdiction constitutes automatic \nconsent to class certification, Defendants argue  that Plaintiff has provided no legal support for \nthis “unique take on the consequences of invoking CAFA jurisdiction because there is none.”  I d. \nat 6.  On this issue, Defendants note that whether a case may proceed as a class action  which  \nbinds individuals who are not participants is a question of law, not a matter of consent, and “failure to obtain class certification does not divest the Court of CAFA jurisdiction.”  Id.  at 6 n.2.   \n Defendants then address Plaintiff’s arguments regarding the applicability of an exception \nto CAFA.  See id.  at 6.  After pointing out that a plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the \nevidence that such an excep tion applies, Defendants content that Plaintiff has offered no \nevidence whatsoever aside from a brief, insufficient statement in his opening memorandum which provides: “ [i]f the number of New York VIPKID Teachers is in the several Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 10 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 \n thousands  . . . and there  are only some 13,000 VIPKID Teachers, then it seems more likely than \nnot that one or more CAFA exception applies to this Action.”   Id. (quoting Pl.’s Mem. at 10).  \nAlthough Defendants concede that there is no way to determine definitively the actual \ncitizenship of each putative class member without interviewing them, they submit that CAFA \nrequires courts to make reasonable assumptions regarding citizenship based on available evidence.  Id. at 8.  To this point, Defendants again cite the Xiong Declaration which provides \nthat VIPKid HK “has contracted with over 200,000 teachers” and “[t]he business mailing address of more than 96% of those teachers is outside of the State of New York.”  See X iong Decl. ¶  4; \nDefs.’ Opp’n at 8 -9.  Based upon this information, Defendants assert  that it is reasonable to \nconclude that fewer than one third of the putative class members are citizens of New York.  Id.   \nat 9.    Moreover, Defendants note that each CAFA  exemption requires a plaintiff to prove that \none or more defendants is a citizen of the forum state.  Id.  at 7.  However, according to counsel, \nthe Defendants  are all foreign entities -- and not New York citizens -- which means that none of \nthose exceptio ns applies and the Court has no discretion to remand.  Id.   With respect to their \ncitizenship, Defendants provide d the Court with a demonstrative chart which t he Court has \nreproduced here:  \nDefendant  Place of Incorporation or \nOrganization  Principal Place of  Business  \nVIPKid International, Inc.  Delaware  California  \nVIPKid HK Limited  Hong Kong  China  \nVIPKid Class HK Ltd.  Hong Kong  China  \nVIPTeach Inc.  Delaware  California  \nBeijing Dami Technology Co., Ltd.  China  China  \nBeijing Dami  Future Technology \nCo., Ltd.  China  China  \nCloud & Smart Industries  Cayman Islands  China  \nTencent America LLC  Delaware  California  \nTencent Cloud LLC  Delaware  Delaware  \nChina Renaissance Holdings Ltd.  Cayman Islands  China  \nSequoia Capital Operations LLC  Delaware  California  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 11 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n Id. at 7 -8.3 \n Next, Defendants oppose Plaintiff’s argument claiming that his FLSA cause of action \ndoes not confer federal question jurisdiction.  See id. at 9.  According to Defendants, Plaintiff’s \nFLSA claim “is not a  subtle point”  and is proclaimed in all capital letters.  Id. at 10.  In addition \nto its typeface, Defendants also point out that this violation of the FLSA is not “one of several theories of liability under state law” b ecause Plaintiff “expressly alleges a violation of a federal \nstatute and seeks a remedy created by that statute.”  Id.  (citing Abdale v. North Shore -Long \nIsland Jewish Health Sys., Inc ., 2014 WL 2945741, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. June 30, 2014)).  As such, \nPlaintiff’s attempt to distance himself from his FLSA claim is immaterial because he “ chose to \nallege a claim under federal law, devoting nearly forty paragraphs of the Complaint to detailing his alleged injuries arising under federal law in a claim that he described as an FLSA claim. ”  Id.  \nat 11 (ci ting Compl. ¶¶  500- 37).  In light of the fact that federal jurisdiction is measured at the \ntime of removal, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot now attempt to change or gloss over his \nallegations to argue that federal question jurisdiction is lacking.  Id.    \n Regarding Plaintiff’s argument on supplemental jurisdiction, Defendants contend that \nPlaintiff’s FLSA claims and state law claims derive from a common nucleus of operative fact s \nand will involve similar witnesses and evidence.  Id. at 11 -14.  In light of this commonality, \nDefendants ask the Court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims.  \n \n3  The information in this chart is based on a combination of declarations submitted \nin support of Defendants’ opposition as well as allegations in the Complaint and other \ndocumentation.  Specifically, the citizenship of the VIPKid Defendants stems from the statements contained in the Xiong Declaration . See Xiong Decl. ¶  2.  Similarly, the citizenship of \nChina Renaissance Holdings is based upon the Declaration of Lixing Wang, its Head of Investment Banking.  See Declaration of Lixing Wang (“Wang Decl.”) [DE 48- 1].  T he \ncitizenship of the Tencent Defendants and Sequoia Capital was based upon the Complaint.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 8 nn. 5, 7 (citing Compl. ¶¶  71, 77).  \n Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 12 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>13 \n Id. at 14.  Lastly, Defendants submit that Plaintiff has misconstrued the purpose of Burford and \nPullman abstention, arguing that nei ther doctrine applies to the instant case.  Id.  at 14 -16. \n  3. Plaintiff’s Reply  \nIn his reply, Plaintiff argues that “Defendants have not alleged any estimate of class size \nrelevant to this action” and “falsely attribute to Plaintiff the so -called allegation that the putative \nclass consists of more than 100,000 individuals.”  See Pl.’s  Reply at 1 -2.  Plaintiff then \n“mount[s] a factual attack against VIPKid’s claim of the number of VIPKid Teachers.”  Id. at 2.  \nCiting Defendants’ statement that it has compensated more than 200,000 teachers, Plaintiff \nclaims that number is “not reasonably indicative of the number of proposed plaintiffs” because VIPKid HK “hires teachers for any number of reasons, for any number of educational platforms” that have no bearing on this case.  Id. at 2 -3.  Plaintiff also reiterates the “factual attack” set fort h \nin his opening brief regarding the claim on VIPKid’s website which states there are more than 100,000 teachers, but the VIPKid’s LinkedIn profile “listed around ten percent of [that] figure \nfor the total number of VIPKid affiliated individuals on the pla tform.”  Id.  at 4.   \nPlaintiff then claims that “VIPKid,” the first named Defendant in the Complaint, “is the \nprimary [D]efendant in this action” and is a New York citizen .  Plaintiff asserts that Defendants \ndo not “utter[] a single word that contradicts P laintiff’s allegations about VIPKid or its New \nYork Headquarters.”  Id. at 5.  Plaintiff then argues that despite Defendants’ claim that 96% of \nthe 200,000 teachers who contracted with VIPKid HK have mailing addresses outside of New York, this statement “s hine[s] no light on the question of the citizenship of the class for this \naction” because, once again, Plaintiff claims that this figure is not indicative of VIPKid teachers in America and Canada because it “likely include[s], in the majority, Chinese teachers in China performing any number of functions unrelated to VIPKid.”  Id.  at 5-6. Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 13 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>14 \n  With regard to Defendants’ arguments concerning federal question jurisdiction provided \nby the FLSA, Plaintiff seems to argue that the existence of such a claim arising under federal law \ndoes not mean that a federal court must assert jurisdiction over it.  Id. at 6 -7.  In a similar vein, \nPlaintiff also argues that cases containing FLSA claims can be remanded when such claims are brought alongside state law claims.  Id. at 8.   Ultimately, Plaintiff argues that the Court must \nremand this action “regardless of the relevance of the [a]bstention [d]octrine,” but further asserts that the Court need not reach this  issue in order to remand the  case.  Id. at 10.  Plaintiff concludes \nthat if the Court does not remand this case, such action would send “ a signal to companies \nworldwide[] that CAFA is a quick and lazy path to federal court, regardless of the quality of facts and arguments the removing party alleges.”  Id.  \nIII. APPLICABLE LAW \n An action initially filed in state court may be removed to federal court if the federal court \nwould have had original jurisdiction.  See  28 U.S.C.  § 1441(a).  District courts have original \njurisdiction over cases involving federal questions, see 28 U.S.C. § 1331, and over certain cases involving diversity of citizenship.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  The Class Action Fairness Act “allows \nfor the exercise of federal diversity jurisdiction over class actions involving 100 or more class \nmembers, in which the amount i n controversy exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000 (exclusive \nof interest and costs), and there is minimal diversity, i.e. , where, inter alia , at least one member \nof the putative class and one defendant are citizens of different states.”  Richins v. Hofs tra Univ., \n908 F. Supp. 2d 358, 360 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Anirudh v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 598 F. Supp. \n2d 448, 450 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)).  As such, CAFA expands federal jurisdiction to permit a \ndefendant to remove a class action “notwithstanding the absence of the complete diversity or \nfederal question otherwise required for removal.”  BlackRock Fin. Mgmt. Inc. v. Segregated Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 14 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>15 \n Acct. of Ambac Assur. Corp., 673 F.3d 169, 175 (2d Cir. 2012) .

ASN Roosevelt Ctr., \nLLC, 588 F. Supp. 2d 350, 353 (E.D.N.Y. 2008)) . \nCAFA also “ includes certain enumerated exceptions, some of which recognize the \npropriety of declining to exercise federal jurisdiction over matters of local concern.”  Id.

It is a plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate by a preponderance of the \nevidence that remand is warranted on the basis of one of these exceptions .4  Anderjaska v. Bank \nof Am., N.A., No. 1:19- CV-03057, 2020 WL 1503418, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. M ar. 30, 2020)  (citing \nGreenwich Fin. Servs. Distressed Mortgage Fund 3 LLC v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 603 F.3d 23, 26 (2d Cir. 2010)) ; Singer , 2018 WL 3635074, at *3 (“ While the level of proof required to \nsatisfy a motion for remand has not been clearly stated by the Second Circuit, other circuits, as \nwell as courts within the Second Circuit, agree that remand must be demonstrated by a \npreponderance of the evidence standard.”).  \nCAFA’s exceptions delineate circumstances where remand is mandatory or where the \ndecision to remand is within the district court’s discretion .  There are two scenarios in which \nremand to state court is mandatory.  See Richins , 908 F. Supp. 2d at 360- 61.  F irst, remand is \n \n4  In his motion, Plaintiff misstates who bears the  burden of proving that an \nexception to CAFA jurisdiction exists by arguing that  “Defendan ts have complete knowledge of \nthe putative class and yet have not made any factual claims that adequately rule out remand to \nNew York on the basis of CAFA exceptions.”  See Pl.’s Mem. at 9.

Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(4)(A)).  Second, remand is \nmandatory where “two -thirds or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes, in the \naggregate, and the primary defendants, are citizens of the State in whic h the action was originally \nfiled.”  28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(4)(B).  The first of these mandatory remand exceptions is commonly referred to as the “local controversy” exception; the second is referred to as the “home state” exception.  See Camilo v. Lyft, Inc. , No. 17- CV-9116, 2018 WL 8582073, at *1- 2 (S.D.N.Y. \nMar. 19, 2018) .   \nA district court may also decline to exercise jurisdiction as a matter of discretion pursuant \nto CAFA’s “interest of justice” exception.  See Ramirez v. Oscar De La Renta LLC , No. 16- CV-\n7855, 2017 WL 2062960, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 12, 2017) .  This exception provides:  \nA district court may, in the interests of justice and looking at the \ntotality of the circumstances, decline to exercise jurisdiction  . . . over a class action in which greater than one -third \nbut less than two -thirds of the members of all proposed plaintiff \nclasses in the aggregate and the primary defendants are citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed based on considerations of — \n \n(A) whether the claims  asserted involve matters of national or \ninterstate interest;  \n(B) whether the claims asserted will be governed by laws of the \nState in which the action was originally filed or by the laws of other States;  \n(C) whether the class action has been pleaded in a manner that seeks to avoid Federal jurisdiction;  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 16 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>17 \n (D) whether the action was brought in a forum with a distinct \nnexus with the class members, the alleged harm, or the defendants;  \n(E) whether the number of citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed in all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate is substantially larger than the number of citizens from any other State, and the citizenship of the other members of the proposed class is dispersed among a substantial number of States; and  \n(F) whether, during the 3 -year period preceding the filing of that \nclass action, 1 or more other class actions asserting the same or similar claims on behalf of the same or other persons have been filed.  \n 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d)(3).   \nIV. DISCUSSION  \n A. CAFA Jurisdiction  Exists  \n On the one hand, Plaintiff does  not appear to dispute that the Complaint was properly \nremoved within the Court’s CAFA diversity jurisdiction.  See Pl.’s Mem. at 7 (“[T]his Court has \nCAFA jurisdiction and, as a result, Defendants may not remove this Action to arbitration and must litigate this Action as a class -action i n open court.”).  On the other hand, Plaintiff also \nseems to challenge the number of potential class members, arguing discovery is necessary to verify the existence of CAF A jurisdiction.  See id.  at 8-11.  The Court disagrees .  Because \nDefendants have established, by a reasonable probability, that the putative class is greater than 100 plaintiffs , discovery on that element of CAFA jurisdiction is not needed.  Despite Plaintiff’s \ncontention that he “did not allege any class size,” see Pl.’s Reply at 2 n.2, t he Complaint \nrepeatedly alleges that there are more than 100,000 VIPKid teachers in the United States and Canada.  See Compl. ¶¶  20, 21, 259, 275, 287, 382.  After Defenda nts utilized this figure as \ngrounds for removal under CAFA -- as it was pled by Plaintiff in the Complaint -- Plaintiff made \na series of convoluted attempts in his opening and reply briefs to walk back this number by Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 17 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>21 \n WL 3635074, at *5 (denying motion to remand after finding plaintiff failed to demonstrate that \nbetween one-  and two -thirds of the proposed class are citizens of New York). \n The Court need not consider the second threshol d requirement of CAFA’s interest of \njustice exception .  However, even if Plaintiff satisfied the  pre-requisite concerning citizenship of \nthe class members, Plaintiff has not met his burden with respect to citizenship of the “primary \ndefendants.”  Plaintiff  argues that “VIPKid is a New York citizen and the primary defendant in \nthis action.”  See Pl.’s Reply at 5 (emphasis in original).  According to Plaintiff, he “has \nconsistently and continuously alleged a single Defendant:  VIPKid.”  Id.   As an initial matter, the \nCourt is concerned that “VIPKid” may not even be a suable entity based up on Defend ants’ \nrepresentation in its Opposition to the instant motion.  Nonetheless, this is not an issue which  \nrequires resolution at this juncture.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 1 n.1 (stating “VIPKid” is not a \n“juridical”  entity).  E ven if “VIPKid” is a proper defendant  and a New York citizen , it is not the \nonly primary  defendant.  Despite Plaintiff’s contention that “VIPKid” is the only Defendant, \nprimary or otherwise, the Complaint is drafted in that manner .  The Complaint explicitly says \nthat this action was brought a gainst VIPKID “and (or as) all entities that ‘provide’ VIPKid, \njointly and severally .”  See Compl. ¶  27.  Consequently, Plaintiff “maintain[s] that [D] efendants  \nare each equally culpable and liable for the injuries purportedly suffered by the putative clas s \nmembers, [and] there is no rational basis upon which to differentiate the defendants’  status as \nbeing primary  or secondary.”  Brook v. UnitedHealth Grp. Inc., No. 06 CV 12954, 2007 WL \n2827808, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 27, 2007) .  The Complaint and the evidence submitted by \nDefendants demonstrates that some, if not all, of the Defendants have principal places of \nbusiness or headquarters outside New York.  For example, there are Defendants who maintain \ntheir principal places of business and/or headquarter s in Delaware, California, and even China -- Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 21 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>22 \n and as a result are considered citizens of those locales.  Accordingly, the primary defendants in \nthis action are not all citizens of New York.   \n In light of the fact that Defendants have met their burden to pr ove that federal jurisdiction \npursuant to CAFA exists, and since Plaintiff has failed to sustain his burden to demonstrate an \nexception to the exercise of that jurisdiction, it is respectfully recommended to Judge Seybert that Plaintiff’s motion to remand be denied.\n8  \n C. Abstention  \n In a last -ditch effort , Plaintiff attempts to invoke the abstention doctrines set forth in the \nseminal Supreme Court cases of Burford v. Sun Oil and Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman.  See Pl.’s Mem. at 15- 17 (citing Bur ford v. Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315 (1943); Railroad \nComm’n of Tex. v. Pullman, 312 U.S. 496 (1941)).   Pursuant to Burford, “a federal court may \nabstain from hearing a case or claim over which it has jurisdiction to avoid needless disruption of \nstate effort s to establish coherent policy in an area of comprehensive state regulation.”  Friedman \nv. Revenue Mgmt. of N.Y., Inc., 38 F.3d 668, 670 -71 (2d Cir.1994) .  The Supreme Court has \ndistilled the Burford doctrine as follows:  \nWhere timely and adequate state- court review is available, a federal \ncourt sitting in equity must decline to interfere with the proceedings \nor orders of state administrative agencies: (1) when there are \n“difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of \nsubstantial public impor t whose importance transcends the result in \nthe case then at bar”; or (2) where the “exercise of federal review of \nthe question in a case and in similar cases would be disruptive of \nstate efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of \nsubstantial public concern.”  \n \n8  Based upon the Court’s finding that it is not divested of CAFA jurisdiction, the \nCourt does not need to determine whether Plaintiff’s FLSA claims constitute a sufficient federal \nquestion to invoke jurisdict ion pursuant to § 1331 nor whether the Court has supplemental \njurisdiction over his state law claims.  Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 22 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>23 \n New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans , 491 U.S. 350, 361 (1989) \n(quoting Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States , 424 U.S. 800, 814 (1976)) . \nThe Second Circuit has identified three factors to consider in determining whether Burford \nabstention is appropriate:  “(1) the degree of specificity of the state regulatory scheme; (2) the \nneed to give one or another debatable construction to a state stat ute; and (3) whether the subject \nmatter of the litigation is traditionally one of state concern.” Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hurlbut , 585 \nF.3d 639, 650 (2d Cir.2009). In light of that standard, Burford abstention is not appropriate here \nbecause this case does not intrude on state policy or regulatory concerns, nor does Plaintiff even \nidentify a regulatory scheme at issue, let alone a complex one.  At best, Plaintiff appears to argue \nthat Burford abstention is appropriate because if this case is litigated in s tate court, the \nDefendants’ activities would then become  subject to the attention of state regulators.  See Pl.’s \nMem. at 16 -17.  This  argument , however, is an incorrect application of Burford and as a result \nthis Court respectfully recommends to Judge Seybert that abstention on these grounds be \nDENIED.     \n Pullman abstention is a “doctrine of constitutional avoidance” which permits a federal \ncourt to “abstain from deciding a state law issue ‘when it appears that abstention may eliminate \nor materially alter the constitutional issue presented.’”  Moore v. County of Suffolk , 851 F. Supp. \n2d 447, 456- 57 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Ohio Bureau of Emp’t Servs. v. Hodory , 431 U.S. 471, \n481 (1977)).  Pullman abstention is only appropriate when three conditions are satisfied:  (1) a state statue is not clear or the issue of stat e law is uncertain; (2) resolution of the federal issue \ndepends upon the interpretation given to the state law; and (3) the state law can be interpreted in a way to avoid or modify the federal constitutional issue.  Id.  (citing McRedmond v. Wilson, 533 \nF.2d 757, 761 (2d Cir. 1976)).  Plaintiff contends that he has “created an unseemly conflict Case 2:20-cv-06370-JS-LGD     Document 54     Filed 08/27/21     Page 23 of 25 PageID #:\n<pageID>24 \n between” this Court and the State Court which could “lead to the premature determination of \nconstitutional questions as Plaintiff alleges fraud committed to advance virtual cloning of American citizens.”  See Pl.’s Mem. at 16.  This is another misapplication of  a federal abstention \ndoctrine.  Plaintiff has not identified a state statute at issue since his claim concerning “virtual cloning” is based upon common law fraud .  Nor has Plaintiff identified a federal constitutional \nquestion that is implicated by this case.   \n Accordingly, this Court respectfully recommend s to Judge Seybert that the Court decline \nto abstain pursuant to Burford or Pullman, and deny Plai ntiff’s request to remand his claims to \nthe extent his request is based upon principles of abstention.   \nV. CONCLUSION  \n For the foregoing reasons, the Court respectfully recommends to Judge Seybert that \nPlaintiff’s motion to remand be DENIED in accordance with this Report and Recommendation. \nVI. OBJECTIONS  \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(c) and Rule 72 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nthe parties shall have fourteen (14) days from service of this Report and Recommendation to file written objection s.  See F\nED. R. CIV. P. 6(a), (e).  Such objections by an attorney of record shall \nbe filed with the Clerk of the Court via ECF.  A courtesy copy of any objections filed is to be \nsent to the Chambers of the Honorable Joanna Seybert.  Any requests for an extension of \ntime for filing objections must be directed to Judge Seybert  prior to the expiration of the \nfourteen (14) day period for filing objections .  Failure to file objections will result in a waiver \nof those objections for purpose s of appeal. Thomas v.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court granted KPMG LLP's motion for summary judgment against Aidong Chen, a former employee who alleged wrongful termination, retaliation, and discrimination based on race and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Chen, who worked on data-related technology projects, failed to demonstrate that his termination was linked to any discriminatory practices by KPMG, and the court found no evidence to support his claims of discrimination or retaliation.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether KPMG discriminated and retaliated against Chen on the basis of his race and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n3. **Court’s Holding**: The court held that Chen did not provide sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation. The court found that KPMG had legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for Chen’s poor performance review and subsequent termination, and Chen failed to demonstrate these reasons were pretext for discrimination.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're part of a club where you allege the leader treated you poorly because of your background. The leader kicks you out for not following club rules and being disruptive. You claim this was unfair and due to discrimination. However, when asked for proof, you don't have any other than your belief and hearsay. The club has clear rules about behavior and shows how you broke them. Without evidence of unfair treatment based on who you are, the decision to remove you is considered justified, and no rules were broken by the club leader.",

ECF No. 69.  Pro se Plaintiff  Aidong Chen  (“Chen ” \nor “Plaintiff”)  opposes the Motion.  ECF No.  79.1  For the reasons explained below,  Defendant’ s \nMotion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED .   \nI. BACKGROUND2 \nThis action  arises from alleged incidents of discrimination and retaliation based on \nPlaintiff’s race or national origin while he was Defendant’s employee .  See generally  Compl., ECF \nNo. 1.   \n \n1 Plaintiff’s opposition brief does not have page numbering, so the Court refers to the page numbering on the electronic \nPDF filing.  See generally  Pl. Br. , ECF No. 79.  \n2 Plaintiff did not file a n itemized response to the Defendant’s Statement of Material Facts  (“SOMF”) , ECF No. 69.2, \nas required by Local Rule 56.1.  See, e.g. , Glazewski v. Corzine , No. 06 -4107, 2009 WL 5220168, at *1 (D.N.J. Dec. \n31, 2009) ( explaining a  “plaintiff ’s pro se  status does not absolve him of the requirement of filing” a response under \nLocal Rule 56.1),  aff’d  385 F. App’x 83 (3d Cir. 2010).  In Plaintiff’s opposition to the instant Motion, however, \n Case 2:18-cv-12650-MCA-JAD   Document 90   Filed 11/24/20   Page 1 of 11 PageID: <pageID>2 \n In September 2014 , Plaintiff  began working for Defendant, a tax, audit, and risk advisory \nservice  provider .  Def. SOMF ¶¶ 1 -2.  He was hired  to be a senior associate in KPMG’s Lighthouse \nOperations Technology organization (“Lighthouse”).  Id. ¶ 3.  Lighthouse was a relatively new \norganization within KPMG and was created to perform research and development of technologies \nfor business applications that could help KPMG better serve its clients.  Id. ¶ 4; Declaration of \nKevin Martelli (“Martelli Decl.”) ¶ 4, ECF No. 69.4.  As a senior associate, Plaintiff’s main duty \nwas to perform technical support for Light house ’s data scientists.  Chen Dep. Tr. 47:2 -8, Peter \nHughes Declaration (“Hughes Decl.”) Ex. 15, ECF No. 69.8.  Plaintiff was also a network  \nadministrator for two operating systems —Linux and Hadoop —which gave him “root access” and \nthe ability to change any and all aspects of those operating systems.  SOMF ¶¶  11, 18.  \n   In Fiscal Year (“FY”) 2016, KPMG decided to put KTech, KPMG’s central info rmation \ntechnology (“IT”) organization, in charge of all production system network administration.  Id. \n¶¶ 7, 20.3  KTech agreed to allow only David  Halik  (“Halik”) , another senior associate, to keep \nlimited network administrator access to the production systems,  and removed access from all other \nLight house  employees, including Plaintiff.  Id. ¶¶ 21-25.  Specifically, KTech refused to continue \n \nPlaintiff states that Defendant “provided voluminous fabrications and willful dishonesties,” Pl. Opp. at 2, and presents \nhis own version of the events as they  relate to his Title VII discrimination  and retaliation claims, see Pl. Opp. at 9 -19.  \nThe Court “often relax[es] procedural rules, including Local Civil Rule 56.1(a), for an unrepresented litigant.”  \nShuman v. Sabol , No. 09 -2490, 2011 WL 4343780, at *6 (D .N.J. Sept. 14, 2011).  The Court will therefore draw the \nrelevant facts from  the Complaint, ECF No. 1, and Plaintiff’s Opposition,  ECF No. 79,  both where supported by the \nrecord,  as well as Defendant’s Statement of Material Facts and Plaintiff’s depositio n.  See Jordan v. Allgroup Wheaton , \n218 F. Supp. 2d 643, 646 n.2 (D.N.J. 2002), aff’d  95 F. App’x 462 (3d Cir. 2004).  The Defendant’s Statement of \nMaterial Facts is treated as undisputed unless otherwise noted.  See Caraballo v. Hershkowitz , No. 14-1094, 2016 WL \n1365994, at *1 (D.N.J. Apr. 6, 2016).  \n3 Lighthouse employees  used both “production systems” and “development systems.”  SOMF ¶ 15.  “Production \nsystems” are those that KPMG employees use daily, “including [in performing] work for clients, running KPMG, and \neverything the Firm needs to operate.”  Id. ¶ 17.  “Development systems” are those that Ligh thouse staff use to perform \n“experimentation development, or testing,” and “do[] not connect to any systems where people are performing actual \nwork, storing critical data, or similar things for which people use IT systems in the business setting.”  Id. ¶ 16.  \nLighthouse employees, Chen included, continued to have network administrator access to development systems.  Id. \n¶ 32. Case 2:18-cv-12650-MCA-JAD   Document 90   Filed 11/24/20   Page 2 of 11 PageID: <pageID>3 \n to give Plaintiff production system network administrative  access because there had been several \ninstan ces where Plaintiff made administrative changes without giving prior notice that had resulted \nin significant loss of data and service interruptions  to KPMG employees .  Id. ¶¶ 26 -27, 30; see also  \nChen Dep. 55: 18-25, 72:14 -20, 75:2 -16 (admitting that he made administrative changes, but \nexplaining it was his view that he could make these changes whenever he wanted without prior \npermission or notice  to others using the systems).    \nAfter initially removing Plaintif f’s production system network administrative access, \nKTech discovered that Plaintiff still retained access to four servers and removed his access to these \nservers  as well .  SOMF ¶ 38.  Plaintiff complained to his supervisor, Kevin Martelli (“Martelli”) .  \nId. ¶ 39.   Martelli  asked Justin Zimmerman, KTech’s Linux administrator, to restore Plaintiff’s \naccess , but  Zimmerman refused.  Id. ¶ 40; Chen Dep. 82:16 -21.  According to Plaintiff, he believed \nthat KTech was limiting Ligh thouse  employees’ network adminis trative access because KTech \nand Light house  were competing to have access to the Linu x and Hadoop servers.  See Chen Dep. \n40:1-4, 83:25 -84:6; SOMF ¶¶ 19, 42.  \nAt the end of FY 2016, Plaintiff met with his Performance Management Leader Martin \nKaestner (“Kaestner”), who issued Plaintiff a “Low Performance Discussion Memo ,” citing \nPlaintiff’s inability to work in a team and failure to communicate, among other problems .  Hughes \nDecl. Ex. C  (“Perfor mance Memo”) , ECF No. 69.8.  In reaching this conclusion, Kaestner received \ninput from several individuals who worked with Plaintiff.  SOMF ¶ 45.  Because  Plaintiff received \na poor performance review, he was not eligible for a promotion  in the next fiscal year.  Id. ¶ 47.  \nFollowing this performance review, Plaintiff became hostile  towards William Koch  (“Koch”) , Case 2:18-cv-12650-MCA-JAD   Document 90   Filed 11/24/20   Page 3 of 11 PageID: <pageID>4 \n Ligh thouse’s Associate Director.  Id. ¶ 48.4  For example, Plaintiff admits that he would stand in \nKoch’s workspace and complain that Koch was rui ning his career by preventing him from getting \nhis network administrator access back.  Id.; see also  Chen Dep. 233 -34.  Koch eventually emailed \nKaestner and Martelli  about the issues he was experiencing with Plaintiff.  SOMF ¶ 52.  Kaestner \naddressed these complaints with Plaintiff.  Id. ¶¶ 53 -54. \nIn FY 2017, Martelli obtained funding for Plaintiff to pursue a project involving graphic \nprocessing units for artificial intelligence  (the “GPU Project”) .  Id. ¶ 55.  The GPU Project, \nhowever, moved much slower than Martelli expected, and eventually Mar telli directed Koch and \nHalik to assist Plaintiff with the project.  Id. ¶¶ 59 -62.  Plaintiff refused to take direction from  \nKoch and impeded Halik’s ability to gain access to the  GPU  Project, and ultimately  Martelli \nremoved Plaintiff’s access to the  project .  Id. ¶¶ 63 -64.  When Halik was eventually able to gain \naccess to the GPU Project, he discovered several problems with th e project that further delayed its \nimplementation.  Id. ¶ 66.  Upon his removal from the GPU  Project, Plaintiff again began to harass \nKoch and Halik.  Id. ¶¶ 67 -71; see also  Hughes Decl. Ex. 5 (letter from Koch to Martelli  \ncomplaining of Plaintiff’s conduct), Ex. 11 (letter from Halik to Martelli and Kaestner detailing \nPlaintiff’s inappropriate conduct), ECF No. 69.8.   Ultimately, based on these letters and in \nconsultation with Simon Phillips (“Phillips”) in KPMG’s  Human Re sources department, Plaintiff \nwas fired  on October 5, 2017.  SOMF ¶¶ 72 -74.  In his deposition, Plaintiff stated that he believed \nhe was fired because Koch and Martelli wanted to take credit for GPU Project.  See Chen Dep. \n288:8 -289:13, 293:6 -13. \n \n4 In Plaintiff’s opposi tion to the instant Motion, he states, without any support, that Koch used to be Plaintiff’s \nPerformance Management Leader but was removed from that position due to “inaction & incompetence.”  Pl. Opp. at \n9.  The truth of this statement is not material to the Motion, so the Court accepts Plaintiff’s statement as true.  Case 2:18-cv-12650-MCA-JAD   Document 90   Filed 11/24/20   Page 4 of 11 PageID: <pageID>5 \n Several m onths after he was terminated, Plaintiff filed an internal complaint with KPMG’s \nEthics & Compliance Group.  Hughes Decl. Ex. 14 (“E&C Complaint”), ECF No. 69.8.  In this \ncomplaint, Plaintiff alleged that Koch provided misleading information to management that \nresulted in Plaintiff’s termination and that Koch tried to take success for Plaintiff’s work product .  \nE&C Complaint at 1.  Plaintiff did not allege discrimination or retaliation on the basis of his race \nor national origin  anywhere in the E&C Complain t.   \nPlaintiff filed a pro se  complaint on August 8, 2018 against KPMG, Koch, Halik, and \nPhillips, alleging wrongful termination, retaliation , and discrimination on the basis of his race and \nnational origin  in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) .  See generally  \nCompl. , ECF No. 1.   The Court dismissed the claims  against the individual Plaintiffs on May 6, \n2019.  ECF No. 35.  KPMG filed the instant Motion on May 15, 2020, ECF No. 69, which Plaintiff \nopposes, ECF No. 79.   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), the Court will grant a motion for \nsummary judgment if the pleadings, depositions , answers to interrogatories, and admissions on \nfile, together with available affidavits, show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact \nand that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Cit ies Serv. Co. , 391 U.S. \n253, 288 -89 (1968)) (internal quotation marks omitted).   Although the Court liberally construes a \npro se  plaintiff’s Complaint and affords the litigant “leeway” in following the “technical rules,” \nthe same summary judgment standard applies.  Wells Fargo Equip. Fin., Inc. v. Inchon LLC , No. \n05-5559, 2007 WL 2688914, at *2 (D.N.J. Sept. 11, 2007) (internal quotation marks and citations \nomitted); see also  Abdul -Aziz v. Lanigan , No. 17 -2806, 2020 WL 3287229, at *6 (D.N.J. June 18, \n2020).  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Title VII Discrimination Claims  \nDefendant argues it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff has not met his \nburden of proving that he was discriminated against because  of his race or national origin .  The \nCourt agrees.   \n “A Title VII plaintiff may state a claim for discrimination under either the pretext theory \nset forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green , 411 U.S. 792 (1973), or the mixed -motive theory \nset forth in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins , 490 U.S. 228 (1989).”  Makk y v. Chertoff , 541 F.3d \n205, 213 (3d Cir. 2008).  Under the McDonnell Douglas  burden -shifting framework , the plaintiff \nmust first establish a prima facie case of discrimination “by showing that: (1) s/he is a member of \na protected class; (2) s/he was quali fied for the position s/he sought to attain or retain; (3) s/he \nsuffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the action occurred under circumstances that could \ngive rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.”  Id. at 214 (citations omitted).  If  those \nelements are met, “then an inference of discriminatory motive arises and the burden shifts to the Case 2:18-cv-12650-MCA-JAD   Document 90   Filed 11/24/20   Page 6 of 11 PageID: <pageID>7 \n defendant to articulate a legitimate, non -discriminatory reason for the adverse employment \naction.”  Id. (citing St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks , 509 U. S. 502, 506 -07 (1993)).  “If the defendant \ndoes so, . . . the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant’s proffered reason is \nmerely pretext for intentional discrimination.”  Id. (citation omitted).   Under the Price Waterhouse  \nmixed -motive framework, “a plaintiff need only present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury \nto conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that ‘race, color, religion, sex, or national origin \nwas a motivating factor for any employment practice.’”  Id. (quot ing Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa , \n539 U.S. 90, 101 (2003)).  \n Here, Plaintiff fails to state a claim for discrimination because he has failed to provide \nevidence that he experienced discrimination on the basis of his race or national origin.   In both his \ndeposition and the E&C Complaint, Plaintiff explains that he believes he was given a poor \nperformance review and eventually terminated because K och was trying to take credit for his work \non the GPU  Project.  See E&C Complaint at 2; Chen Dep. 293:6 -13.  Plaintiff  makes no mention \nof discrimination in proffering explanations  for why he was not promoted and eventually \nterminated.   In fact, in his Opposition, Plaintiff continues to emphasize that he was terminated \nbecause Koch “wanted to take full credit” for the GPU Project.  See Pl. Opp. at 1 -2 (“[There \nwere  n]o legitimate reasons [for] firing plaintiff. . . .   Instead, solid evidence shows that it is \nbecause the [GPU] project demonstrated huge value (billion dollars annual revenue), [Koch] \nwanted to take full credit by a shady reallocation to his direct report, [and] . . . abused his \nadministrative power . . . to achieve this with torture and slavery.”) .   \nIn his Complaint and Opposition, however, Plaintiff cites instances of race - and national \norigin -based discrimination associated with  promotion s and terminations at KPMG .  See Compl. Case 2:18-cv-12650-MCA-JAD   Document 90   Filed 11/24/20   Page 7 of 11 PageID: <pageID>8 \n Ex. at 2, ECF No. 1.15 (explaining that only Caucasian staff members were promoted and that all \nthree non -Caucasian members of Lig hthouse ’s “beginners” were either fired or not promoted); Pl. \nOpp. at 21 -22 (listing non -Caucasian individuals who were fired from KPMG).   Where, as here, a \nplaintiff seeks to prove an inference of intentional discrimination —the fourth factor of the \nMcDonn ell Douglas  prima  facie case —through “comparator evidence,” to survive summary \njudgment he “ must submit evidence that [he] is ‘similarly situated ’ to [his] comparators and that \nthese employees have been treated differently or favorably by their employer. ”  Baldwin v. \nGramiccioni , No. 16 -1675 , 2019 WL 2281580, at *8 (D.N.J. May 29, 2019)  (citing Williams v. \nMorton , 343 F.3d 212, 221 (3d Cir. 2003) ).  “Similar ly situated” means “similar in all relevant \nrespects,” including “ the requirements, duties and responsibilities of the respective jobs ” and “ the \nconduct (or misconduct) in which each employee engaged .”  Id. (internal quotation marks and \ncitations omitted).    \nHere, Plaintiff has not met this burden.   In both his Complaint and Opposition, Plaintiff \ncites specifically  to the experiences of Pauline Barnes and Shabbar Alidina.  Compl. Ex. at 2; Pl. \nOpp. at 21.  According to Plaintiff, Paul ine Barnes , an African American woman who worked at \nLighthouse and KTech, was fired in February 2016.   Pl. Opp. at 21.   Shabbar Alidina, an African \nAmerican man who worked at KTech, received “several empty promises from both KTech and \nLighthouse ,” Pl. Opp.  at 21, and was not promoted for three and a half years while other Caucasian \nstaff was promoted, Compl. Ex. at 2.   Plaintiff provides no evidence that either Pauline Barnes or \nShabbar Alidina held similar positions to Plaintiff ’s or engaged in similar conduct as Plaintiff.6  \n \n5 The Court refers to the page numbering on the electronic PDF filing of the exhibit to the Complaint.  \n6 Plaintiff makes other empty allegations as well.  For example, he identifies an individ ual named “Lakshmi,” an \nIndian woman, who had “serious confrontations” with Halik and Koch, and eventually left the group.  He also states \nthat Debajyoti Roy, an Indian man, left KPMG because “the environment was super political.”  Pl. Opp. at 21.  Plainti ff \nfailed to submit any evidence that these employees are “similar in all relevant respects .”  Baldwin , 2019 WL 2281580, \n Case 2:18-cv-12650-MCA-JAD   Document 90   Filed 11/24/20   Page 8 of 11 PageID: <pageID>9 \n Ultimately, Plaintiff has not met “his burden of providing some affirmative evidence, i.e. not just \nmere allegations, to establish a prima facie case.”  See Cordero v. Warren , No. 12 -2136, 2018 WL \n3756447, at *2 (D.N.J. Aug . 8, 2018) (citing Barnett v. N. J. Transit Corp. , 573 F. App’x 239, 243 \n(3d Cir. 2014)) (applying this burden to pro se  plaintiff).   Accordingly, Defendant is entitled to \nsummary judgment on Plaintiff’s Title VII discrimination claims.7 \nB. Title VII Retaliat ion Claims  \nPlaintiff also advances retaliation claims under Title VII.   Defendant argues it is entitled to \nsummary judgment because Plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of Title VII retaliation .  \nThe Court agrees.  \nTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII , a plaintiff must show “(1) \n[that he engaged in] protected employee activity; (2) adverse action by the employer either after \nor conte mporaneous with the employee’s protected activity; and (3) a causal connection between \nthe employee’s protected activity and the employer’s adverse action.”  Daniel v. Sch. Dist. of \nPhila. , 776 F.3d 181, 193 (3d Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and cit ation omitted).  “For the \npurposes of the first prong . . . protected opposition activity includes not only an employee’s filing \nof formal charges of discrimination against an employer but also informal protests of \n \nat *8.  Moreover, Plaintiff undermines his own argument by introducing evidence that Darryl Swofford, a white  \nemployee, was also treated poorly by KPMG.  Pl. Opp. at 21 -22. \n7 Even assuming Plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination, Defendant h as proffered a “legitimate, \nnon-discriminatory reason” for not promoting him and eventually terminating him.  See Makky , 541 F.3d at 214.  It \nis KPMG policy that individuals who receive poor performance reviews do not receive a promotion, SOMF ¶ 47, and \nDefendant contends that it  eventually fired Plaintiff because he created a hostile work environment by harassing Koch \nand Halik, SOMF ¶¶ 67-71.  In response, Plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence that these legitimate grounds for \ntermination were “merely  pretext” for discrimination.  See Makky , 541 F.3d at 214; Carter v. N.J. Dep’t of Human \nServs. , No. 18 -12469, 2020 WL 3427986, at *7 (D.N.J. June 23, 2020) (“Even if Plaintiff establishes a prima facie  \ncase . . . [his] claim fails because he does not pres ent any evidence that Defendant [’s] reasons for its actions are merely \na pretext for discrimination.”) ( internal quotation m arks and citation omitted).  Case 2:18-cv-12650-MCA-JAD   Document 90   Filed 11/24/20   Page 9 of 11 PageID: <pageID>10 \n discriminatory employment practices, incl uding making complaints to management.”  Id.  (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted).    \nHere, Plaintiff has failed to show that he was retaliated against for reporting discriminatory \nemployment practices.  In both his Complaint and Opposition to the instant Motion, Plaintiff \nalleges that Koch retaliated against him by giving “malicious feedback” that led to a poor \nperformance review after Koch was removed f rom his role as Plaintiff’s management leader.  \nCompl. Ex. at 3; see also Pl. Opp. at 9 -16 (additionally alleging that Plaintiff was harassed by \nKoch, who wanted to take credit for Plaintiff’s success on his GPU Project) .  Such retaliation, even \nif it occurred, is not retaliation for any protected action taken by Plaintif f.  In fact, Plaintiff neither \nalleges  nor points to any record evidence that he filed a formal complaint or otherwise complained \nto management about discr imination on behalf of his race or national origin.  Plaintiff therefore \ncannot establish a prima face case of retaliation, and Defendant is entitled to summary judgment.  \nSee, e.g. , Hoist v. New Jersey , No. 12 -5370, 2015 WL 4773275, at *21 (D.N.J. Aug. 13 , 2015) \n(granting summary judgment to defendant on retaliation claim because “[a]fter reviewing the \nrecord, the Court c[ould] not find a single complaint Plaintiff made —whether informal or formal —\nconcerning an employment practice that she found to be discr iminatory towards her because of her \nrace”).  \nIV.

    "summary": "1. Summary:\nIn the case Sultan v. Trump, the plaintiff, Ahwar Sultan, a noncitizen student in the U.S., challenges the revocation of his F-1 visa and termination of his Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS) record, which occurred due to an Executive Order advocating the deportation of noncitizen students involved in protests. The court partially grants Sultan's request for a Temporary Restraining Order, finding that he has shown a likelihood of success on his claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment for lack of due process. Notably, the case involves the use of AI in the \"Catch and Revoke\" program to identify and cancel visas of individuals associated with activities or groups deemed threatening to national security.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue:\nThe key legal issue is whether the revocation of Sultan's F-1 visa and termination of his SEVIS record, without adequate due process, violates the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n3. Court's Holding:\nThe court held that Sultan is likely to succeed on his claims that the termination of his SEVIS record violated the APA and his procedural due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. Thus, the court granted a temporary restraining order requiring the reinstatement of Sultan's SEVIS record to its \"active\" status, preventing further adverse action until a full review on the merits.\n\n4. ELI5 explanation:\nImagine you’re a student from another country studying in the U.S., and one day the government suddenly takes away your permission to be here, without telling you why or letting you explain your side. A court has said that the government might have done this unfairly, so the judge temporarily put things back to normal while deciding the right way to handle it. The court wants to make sure students have a fair chance to argue their case before being told they have to leave the country.",

After considering the parties’ briefing and oral argument, for the reasons below, \nthe court will GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART Plaintiff’s Motion.   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Background \n During the 2024 presidential campaign, Defendant , then a candidate for President,  \nrepeatedly vowed to deport noncitizen students who participate in protest activity.  Compl. ¶ 108, ECF No. 1 (“Compl.”).  On or about October 28, 2023, he told one news outlet, “All of the resident aliens who joined in the pro- jihadist protest this month, nobody’s ever seen anything like it.  Come \n2025, we will find you and we will deport you.”  Id .  He repeated similar statements on May 14, \n2024, and on August 13, 2024, to reporters.  Id. ¶¶ 109–10 Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 1 of 11Page 2 of 11  \n  On January 30, 2025, President Trump issued  Executive Order (“EO”) “Protecting the \nUnited States from Foreign  Terrorists and  Other National  Security and Public Safety Threats.”  \nExec. Order No. 14161, 90 Fed. Reg. 8451 (Jan. 30, 2025) .  Section 1(b)  of the EO  states that in \norder “[t]o protect Americans  . . . the  United States must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens \notherwise already present in the United States do not  bear hostile attitudes  toward its citizens, \nculture, government, institutions, or founding principles, and do not advocate for, aid, or support \ndesignated foreign terrorists and other  threats to our national security .”  Compl . ¶ 112 ( internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted ) (emphasis added) .  The EO requires Defendants Secretary \nof Homeland Security Kristi Noem , Attorney General Pam Bondi , and the Director of National \nIntelligence Tulsi Gabbard to do the following:  \n1. Section 2(a)(i): “[I]dentify all resources that may be used to ensure that all aliens  . . . who \nare already in the United States, are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”  \n \n2. Section 2(a)(ii): “[A]scertain whether [an] individual seeking [an immigration] benefit \nis . .  . not a security or public safety threat.”  \n \n3.  Section 2(a)(iv): “[V]et and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who . . . are \nalready inside the United States.” \n \n4. Section 3: “Recommend any actions necessary to protect the American people from the \nactions of foreign nationals who have undermined or seek to undermine the fundamental constitutional rights of the American people[.]”\n1 \n Compl. ¶¶  113 (a) –(c).  On March 6, 2025, the State Department confirmed that: (1) it was \nplanning to review internal databases to see whether any visa holders were arrested and had not \nbeen subjected to immigration enforcement; id. ¶ 131, and (2) it would enact the “Catch and \nRevoke” program, an artificial intelligence effort to “cancel the visas of foreign nationals who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups.”  Id. ¶ 132.  On March 27, 2025, \n \n1 These recommendations were due on February 19, 2025, but have not been made public.  \nCompl. ¶  22. Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 2 of 11Page 3 of 11  \n Secretary  of State Marco  Rubio announced at a press conference that the State Department had \nrevoked the visas of approximately 300 foreign students.  Id. ¶  8. \n Plaintiff Sultan is one such student.  He is enrolled as a graduate student at the Ohio State \nUniversity (“OSU”), studying Comparative Studies. Id.  ¶ 15.  He  also works  as a Teaching \nAssistant for an Introduction to Humanities course.  Id. ¶ 45.  The other Plaintiff is Students for \nJustice in Palestine  (“SJP”) , a student -led organization at OSU committed to advocating for \nPalestinian rights, of which Sultan is a n “outspoken member .”  Id. ¶¶ 16, 74 .   \n On April 25, 2024, Sultan  was arrested after he participated in a SJP protest demanding \nthat OSU divest from Israel.  Id. ¶¶ 4–3, 70.  His charges were later dismissed and expunged after \nhe completed  10 hours of community service.  Id. ¶¶ 6, 70.   \n On April 21, 2025, at 1: 37 A. M., OSU notified Sultan  by email  that h is SEVIS record  had \nbeen  terminated for “ otherwise failing to maintain status – individual identified in criminal records \ncheck  and/or has had their VISA revoked.”   Id. ¶ 87; Pl.’s Reply, Ex. C, at 1, ECF No. 9- 3 (“Ex. \nC”).  The notice instructed Sultan to cease all F -1-related  activity  and campus  employment \nimmediately but provided no further  information.  Ex. C at 1.     \n On April 7, 2025, at 9:38 A.M., the U.S. Consul General in Mumbai emailed  Sultan \ninforming him that his F -1 visa had been revoked.   Pl.’s Reply, Ex. B at 1– 2, ECF No. 9- 2 (“Ex. \nB”).  Defen se counsel confirmed the same on the record during the court’s hearing on April 23, \n2025.  Temp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 8:23–9:3.   \n Plaintiffs filed suit in this court on April 15, 2025, alleging  several  claims  under the First \nAmendment.  Compl. ¶¶  140–64.  Only Sultan, however, brought claims under the Administrative \nProcedure Act  (“APA”) , the Fifth Amendment ’s Due Process Clause, and the Immigration and \nNationality Act.  Id. ¶¶ 165 –90.  In Sultan’s  motion for a temporary restraining order, however, he Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 3 of 11Page 4 of 11  \n relies  on his APA claim and his Fifth Amendment claim for procedural and substantive due \nprocess.  Pl. ’s TRO  at 9–10.  H e ask s the court  to: \n1. Declare that Defendants’ termination of his  F-1 student status under the SEVIS system \nwithout affording him sufficient notice and opportunity to be heard violates the Fifth \nAmendment and APA;  \n \n2. Order  Defendants to provide adequate individualized proceedings before an impartial \nadjudicator;  \n \n3. Order Defendants to reinstate his  SEVIS record at OSU  \n \na. or provide him with a reasonable period to maintain his valid F -1 status by allowing \nhim to transfer to another Department of Homeland Security (“DHS ”)-approved \nschool if his reinstatement at OSU is not accepted; \n \n4. Enjoin Defendants from detaining him  while this matter is  pending. \n Id. at 14 . \n \nB. Legal Background  \n An F-1 visa controls a noncitizen  student ’s entry into the United Sates, not  their lawful \nstatus  while in the country.  Congress requires a noncitizen with an F-1 visa to be a “bona fide \nstudent” and “to pursue a full course of study,” 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(F)(i), or “engag[ e] in \nauthorized practical training.”  8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(5)(i).   \n The SEVIS database is maintained by I mmigration and Customs Enforcement (“I CE”) to \nmanage and track noncitizen s’ compliance  with the terms of their  visa status.   Compl. ¶  33; 8 \nU.S.C. § 1372(a)(1) ; 86 Fed. Reg. 69663 (Dec. 8, 2021) .  A noncitizen student maintains F -1 legal \nstatus only if the “student is making normal progress toward completed a course of study.”  8 \nC.F.R. § 214.3(f)(5) (i).  Designated School Officials must report through SEVIS when a student \nfails to maintain status.  Id. § 214.3(g)(2) (ii)(A).  If a student’s SEVIS record is terminate d, there \nare consequences : \n1. The s tudent loses all on-  and/or off -campus employment authorization.  Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 4 of 11Page 5 of 11  \n 2. The s tudent cannot re -enter the United States on the terminated SEVIS record.  \n3. ICE agents may investigate to confirm the departure of the student.  \n4. Any associated F -2 or M -2 dependent records are terminated.  \n “Terminate a Student,” U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, https://perma.cc/5K2T -2JXD.  \nIn addition, when a student’s SEVIS record is terminated , there is “no grace period” for “duration \nof status ”: “If the student and dependents are still in the United States, the student must either \napply for reinstatement, or the student and dependents must leave the United States immediately. ”  \nId.   \n DHS  can terminate a noncitizen’s F -1 legal  status in one of two ways : (1) student -initiated \nfailure; (2) an agency -initiated termination.  Under  the first category, a noncitizen  student  can lose \ntheir lawful status if they engage in unauthorized employment, 8 C.F.R . § 214.1(e), provide  false \ninformation to DHS , id. § 214.1(f), or is convicted of a “crime of  violence ” with a potential \nsentence of more than a year .  Id. § 214.1(g).  For the second category, DHS can terminate a \nstudent’s F -1 status under three circumstances:  \n1. When a previously- granted waiver under INA § 212(d)(3) or (4) is revoked;  \n \n2. When a private bill to confer lawful permanent residence is introduced in Congress; or  \n \n3. When DHS publishes a Federal Register notification identifying national security, diplomatic, or public safety reasons for termination. \nId. § 214.1(d).  Visa revocation is not  a basis for SEVIS  record  termination.  In fact, in a \n2010 policy guidance document, DHS stated that “[v] isa revocation is not, in itself, a cause for \ntermination of the student’s SEVIS record.”  Pl. ’s Reply, Ex. A, Dep’t. Homeland Security, Policy Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 5 of 11Page 6 of 11  \n Guidance 1004- 04-Visa Revocations, at 3 (2010) , ECF No. 9- 1 (“Ex. A”) .2  While visa r evocation \ndoes not necessarily terminate a noncitizen’s  status in the United States , the reason for the \nrevocation could lead DHS to review the student’s record and determine that the individual is out \nof status.  Id. at 1 –3.   \n The Secretary of State has wide latitude to refuse entry or deport noncitizens if he has \n“reasonable grounds to believe” that their  presence or activities “would have potentially serious \nadverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”  See 8 U.S.C. §  1227(a)(4)(C)(i).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n A temporary restraining order is “an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only \nwhen the party seeking relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Postal Police \nOff. Ass ’n v. U.S. Postal Serv., 502 F. Supp. 3d 411, 418 (D.D.C. 2020)  (citation omitted) .  As \nwith a preliminary injunction, a party seeking a temporary restraining order  must establish “(1) \nthat he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in his favor; and (4) that an \ninjunction is in the public interest .”  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(quoting Sherley v. Sebelius , 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  The third and fourth factors \nmerge when the gover nment is an opposing party.  Nken v. Holder , 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  \n A court also considers the “underlying purpose” of a temporary restraining order —\n“preserving the status quo and preventing irreparable harm” until it has an opportunity to rule on the merits.  See Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers Loc. No. 70 \nof Alameda Cnty., 415 U.S. 423, 439 (1974); Shelley v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 775 F. Supp. \n \n2 Defense counsel represented at the court’s hearing on April 28, 2025, that he has “not received \na response” “as to whether or not” the 2010 policy “has been cancelled.”  Temp. Restraining \nOrder Hr’g Tr. at 17:8 –10. Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 6 of 11Page 7 of 11  \n 2d 197, 202 (D.D.C. 2011) (“The court may issue a temporary restraining order (‘TRO’) when a \nmovant is faced with the possibility that irreparable injury will occur even before the hearing for a preliminary injunction required by Federal Rule of Civil Proc edure 65(a) can be held.”); Elec. \nData Sys. Fed. Corp. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 629 F. Supp. 350, 352 (D.D.C. 1986) (“In the context of the limited purpose of a temporary restraining order, the Court ’s analysis of these factors seeks \nprincipally to ensure pr eservation of the status quo.”).  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Irreparable Harm  \n Demonstrating irreparable harm is “a threshold requirement in granting temporary \ninjunctive relief.”  Beattie v. Barnhart , 663 F. Supp. 2d 5, 8 (D.D.C. 2009) (citing CityFed Fin. \nCorp. v. Off. of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).  To show irreparable harm, \nthe “injury alleged must be ‘both certain and great, actual and not theoretical, beyond remediation, and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.’”  Church v. Biden, \n573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 138 (D.D.C. 2021) (quoting Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA , 787 \nF.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015)  (emphasis in original) ). \n Sultan has shown that he faces  irreparabl e harm from  Defendants’ actions .  His SEVIS \nrecord has been  terminated , Ex. 3 at 1, and Defendants  confirm ed that his F-1 visa has also been  \nrevoked.  Temp. Restraining Order  Hr’g Tr. at 9: 9–10.  Yet , despite being asked by the court at \nthe temporary restraining order  hearing, defense counsel stated that he did not know  whether  \nSultan  is accruing unlawful presence in the United States because he is waiting for a response from \nICE.  Id. at 13:15–14: 3.  Defense counsel also stated that he could not say whether the government  \nintends  to initiate removal proceedings.  Id. at 22:12–15.  As a result, Sultan is in a c atch-22 \nsituation —he cannot attend  school or work because his SEVIS record is terminated; nor do es he \nknow whether he should leave the United States  immediately or risk being subject to removal Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 7 of 11Page 8 of 11  \n proceedings , because Defendants refuse to provide him with the necessary information.  Sultan \nmust therefore wait in legal limbo , at possible risk of detention, until Defendants decide whether \nand how he should be removed.  \n To be sure, Defendants are correct that  “the burden of  removal alone cannot constitute the \nrequisite irreparable injury .”  Nken , 556 U.S. at 435.  But Sultan’s harm does not end there.  He is \n(1) unable to work without a work authorization; (2) harmed by the allegation that he has a criminal \nrecord; and (3) is accruing unlawful presence in the United States, which places him at risk of detention and deportation and jeopardizes any opportunity he may have to return to the U nited \nStates  for employment, educa tion, or personal travel.  Pl. ’s TRO at 10–11.  Other district judges \nin this C ircuit considering similar challenges for terminating certain international students’ SEVIS \nrecords and F -1 visas have found similar harm and, as a result, have entered at least seven \ntemporary restraining orders  to date .  Temp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 2:15–24.\n3 \n Defendants’ arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  They argue  that Sultan has not \nlost his “ability to complete his academic studies ,” nor does he “include allegations” that ICE \n“revoked any employment authorization.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 13, ECF No. 8 (“Defs.’ Opp’n”).   Yet \nSultan was instructed  by OSU on April 3, 2025, to cease all F -1 related activity , including school \nand work.  Ex. 3 at 1.  Defendants respond that OSU, not DHS, sent Sultan the April 3 email.  \nTemp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 17:17–19.  But r egardless of who sent the email , DHS’s  own \npolicy is that termination of  a noncitizen student’s  SEVIS record means that the y should at least \n \n3 See also Hinge v.

Temp. Restraining \nOrder Hr’g Tr. at 14:17–25, 15:1 –5.  As an officer of the court, counsel has a duty of candor to \nanswer its questions.  United States v. Bruce , 89 F.3d 886, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (explaining that \nthe duty of candor applies even if compliance risk disclosure of confidential information and \nincludes the obligation “to avoid making a false statement to the tribunal”).  At this juncture, more \nthan two weeks ha ve elapsed since Sultan filed his  Complain t and  the court is highly skeptical of \ncounsel’s representations  that Defendants are still w aiting for ICE to confirm whether Sultan’s \npresence in the United States is unlawful .  Temp. Restraining Order Hr’g Tr. at 13: 15–14: 3.  \nTherefore, the court will order  Defendants to designate  a representative to appear at the court’s \nnext hearing who can make authoritative representations on behalf of DHS  and ICE .  \nB. Likelihood of Success  \n Sultan  has also shown a likelihood of success on at least his APA claim  that Defendants’ \nactions are arbitrary and capricious, violate DHS regulation s, and fail to accord him  due process .  \nPl.’s TRO at 8 –9; Compl. ¶¶  165–75.  As an initial matter, terminating  Sultan’s SEVIS record is \nlikely a final agency action, as it has  a potentially severe legal consequence  for P laintiff, who can \nno longer work and who may have to leave the United States.  Bennett v. Spear s, 502 U.S. 154, \n178 (1997) (requiring a two- step inquiry for finality: (i) action must mark the end of the agency’s \nprocess, and (ii) action must be one  from  which legal consequences will flow).  Defendants point \nto no legal authority to ter minate Sultan’s SEVIS record based on his expunged, and indeed, \ndismissed April 2024 charges.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 5– 18.  Consequently, OSU’s notification to  Sultan \non DHS’s behalf that his SEVIS record termination was because he was  “identified in  [a] criminal Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 9 of 11Page 10 of 11  \n records check ” does not appear to be based on  reasoned decision making, and therefore may be \narbitrary and capricious .  Ex.3 at 1; 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   Even though Defendants refuse to  \nconfirm whether Sultan ’s F-1 legal status is terminated, it is reasonable to assum e that it is , because \nhis visa has been revoked and his SEVIS record terminated, in which case Defendants have  \nviolated 8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d)  by not following its own regulation before doing so.  And because the \nAPA provides for due process, Defendants ’ failure to  provide Sultan with an opportunity to be \nheard regarding his SEVIS record termination  also indicates a likelihood of success on the merits .  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D).   \nC. Balance of Equities and Public Interest  \nFinally, t he balance of equities and public interest tip in favor of granting a  temporary \nrestraining order.  Pursuing A m.’s Greatness v. FEC , 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016)  (stating  \nthat the equities and public interest are “one and the same” when  the government is the non -\nmovant).  Sultan risks deportation or accrual of unlawful presence; in contrast, DHS is not harmed \nby temporarily reactivating Sultan’s SEVIS record pending further review of this case’s  merits .   \n Accordingly, to preserve the status quo, the court will grant Sultan ’s Motion insofar  that it \nseeks his SEVIS record  be returned  to “Active” as of April 3, 2025, and that Defendants be  \nenjoined from modifying Sultan’s SEVIS record  based on  his April 23, 2024, arrest at OSU.  Pl. ’s \nTRO at 14 –15. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n For the foregoing reasons , the court will GRANT IN PART and DENY IN PART  \nPlaintiff’s Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order .  A corresponding order will follow shortly.  Case 1:25-cv-01121-TSC     Document 12     Filed 04/24/25     Page 10 of 11Page 11 of 11  \n Date: April 24, 2025 \nTanya S. Chutkan  \nTANYA S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this court case, Thomas Sullivan filed a lawsuit against Pfizer, alleging that the prescription drug Lipitor caused him various health problems and that Pfizer did not provide adequate warnings. The District Court granted Pfizer's motion for summary judgment, as Sullivan failed to provide admissible expert testimony linking Lipitor to his alleged injuries, which is essential to establish causation under Connecticut law.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Sullivan could prove that the prescription drug Lipitor was the cause of his numerous alleged health problems, which would require appropriate expert testimony to establish causation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Sullivan could not establish the necessary causation for his claims because he did not provide admissible expert testimony connecting Lipitor to his specific health issues. Consequently, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Pfizer, dismissing Sullivan's claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you eat a candy, and later you don't feel well. You want to blame the candy, but you have to prove it was actually the candy that made you sick. In legal terms, this means you need a doctor or expert to say for sure, \"Yes, this candy did make you sick.\" In this case, Sullivan didn't have a doctor or expert say that Lipitor caused his sickness, so the court said, \"Sorry, you can't win without that proof,\" and sided with the candy maker (Pfizer) instead.",

Although the Complaint  does not specify a  statutory violation, the Court interprets the \nComplaint as alleging violations of the Connecticut Product Liability Act (“CPLA”), Conn. Gen. \nStat. § 52–572m, et seq. Defendant  has moved for summary judgment  (ECF No. 23.)  For th e \nreasons that follow , the Court GRANTS Defendant’ s motion.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Relevant Factual Background1 \nSullivan  suffered from a heart attack in December 2006. ( Defendant’s  Local Rule 56(a)1 \nStatement, ECF No. 25 (“Def.’s  L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt.”) ¶ 1; Plaintiff’s Local Rule 56(a )2 Statement, \nECF No. 28- 2 (“Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt.”) ¶ 1.) After the heart attack, doctors prescribed—and \nSullivan began taking —Lipitor, in order to “prevent another heart attack.”  (Def. ’s L.R. 56(a)1 \n                                                 \n1 Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed, and recounted in the light most \nfavorable to the nonmovant, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. \nWeinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 41 (2d Cir. 2000).  Case 3:14-cv-01374-MPS   Document 35   Filed 03/04/16   Page 1 of 92 \n Stmt. ¶  1; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt . ¶ 1.) Lipitor  is a type of prescription drug called a “statin.” \n(Pl.’s Reply, ECF No. 33 at 2). Sullivan ceased taking Lipitor i n January 2012. ( Def.’s  L.R. \n56(a)1 Stmt. ¶  1; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 1.)  \nSullivan  alleges that during and after the  approximately  five year period he was taking \nLipitor, he  suffer ed from  the following injuries and symptoms: \n• severe peripheral neuropathy;  \n• muscle wasting (60 lbs.) and myopathy;  \n• cataracts;  \n• chronic cough (probable interstitial lung disease);  \n• high CPK levels  indicating muscle damage;  \n• elevated IgG para protein;  \n• low testosterone;  \n• elevated liver enzymes;  \n• severe sinus congestion;  \n• thyroid issue with continual cold body sensations;  \n• lack of sensation in hands, legs and feet;  \n• loss of balance and coordination;  \n• wheelch air depend[ency];  \n• lack of grip strength;  \n• swollen feet;  \n• reduced ability to heal from cuts/bruises;  \n• cellular health at 3.3 instead of normal 6.0- 8.0 range;  \n• lack of energy and lack of strength;  \n• groin pain;  \n• constipation;  \n• ear pain;  \n• trans global amnesia;  \n• muscle and joint pain;  \n• erectile dysfunction;  \n• reduced ability to sleep;  \n• rectum pain;  \n• heel pain; and  \n• poor appetite.  \n \n(Compl., ECF No. 1 at 9- 10.) \n“No medical doctor has ever told Plaintiff that Lipitor caused any of his alleged  injuries.” \n(Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1  Stmt. ¶ 4; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 4.) In fact, Sullivan’s treating physicians Case 3:14-cv-01374-MPS   Document 35   Filed 03/04/16   Page 2 of 93 \n “have told him that they do not believe that Lipitor caused his  ailments. ” (Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1 \nStmt. ¶ 4; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 4.)  Moreover, Sullivan conceded that “no doctor has ever told \nhim that he has interstitial lung disease,” “that medical tests revealed that he does not have \ninterstitial lung disease,” “and that doctors concluded his cough is caused by acid reflux.”  (Def.’s \nL.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. ¶ 5; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 5.) Sullivan also “conceded that he had \ncomplained to his doctor of heel pain in January 2006, a full year before he started taking Lipitor.” ( Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. ¶ 6; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 6.) Sullivan’s former \ncardio logist, Dr. Dennis L. Dobkin, testified that he does not believe that Lipitor caused \nSullivan’s  alleged injuries. ( Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. ¶ 7; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 7.)  Finally, \nneuromuscular specialist Dr. Kevin J. Felice tr eated Sullivan  for approx imately one and a half \nyears  and he also  testified that he did not believe that Lipitor caused Sullivan’s  alleged injuries.\n 2 \n(Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1  Stmt. ¶ 8; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 8.)  \nB. Procedural Background  \n Sullivan , a citizen of Connecticut,  filed his original complaint in September 2014 in the \nSuperior Court of the State of Connecticut, Judicial District of  Litchfield . (ECF No. 1 at 8- 10.) \nOn September 19, 2014, Pfizer , a citizen of Delaware and New York, removed the action to \nfederal court based on diversity jurisdiction. ( Id. at 1-2 ¶¶ 3 -5.)  \n                                                 \n2 Sullivan “denies” that the doctors’ conclusions are correct (Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶¶ 4- 8), and \navers that “doctors have been duped by the drug companies’ propaganda.” ( Id. ¶ 4.) While Pfizer \ncites to specific quotations in the deposition testimony of Sullivan and his doctors, Sullivan’s \n“denials” are not followed by any “specific citation to (1) the affidavit of a witness competent to testify as to the facts at trial” or to “(2) evidence that would be admissible at trial,” as required by Rule 56(a)(3) of the Local Rules of Civil Procedure for the District of Connecticut. CT R USDCT L.Civ.R. 56(a)(3). In fact, Sullivan’s only citation in his L.R.56(a)2 Statement is to his Exhibit 1, which is a website describing negative characteristics of statins, adapted from a 2003 essay by Owen R. Fonorow entitled, CoQ10 and Statins: the Vitamin C Connection. Fonorow has not been disclosed as an expert witness in this case. Sullivan was specifically ad vised of the \nrequirements of Local Rule 56 in a Notice to Pro Se Litigant Opposi ng Motion for Summary \nJudgment filed by the Defendant as required by Local Rule 56(b). (ECF No. 26.)  Case 3:14-cv-01374-MPS   Document 35   Filed 03/04/16   Page 3 of 94 \n The Court’s November 4 , 2014, S cheduling O rder (ECF No. 14) adopted the parties’ \nproposed deadline of May 11, 2015 ( see ECF No. 13 at 5- 6), by which Sullivan  would disclose \nhis expert witnesses.  On March 17, 2015, Sullivan disclosed Dr. Stephanie Sene ff as an expert \nwitness. ( Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. ¶ 10; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶  10.) Dr. Seneff “has a B.S. in \nbiophysics, an M.S. and E.E. in electrical engineering, and a Ph.D . in electrical engineering and \ncomputer science.” ( Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. ¶ 13; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 13.) She “is not a \nmedical doctor, never attended medical school, and does not practice medicine.” ( Def.’s L.R. \n56(a)1  Stmt. ¶ 13; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 13.) She is employed by the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology as a Senior Research Scientist in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence \nLab. ( Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. ¶ 13; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 13.) Her career focus is on \n“developing a  computational model for the human auditory system, understanding human \nlanguage so as to develop algorithms and systems for human computer interactions, as well as applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gene predictions.”\n3 (Def.’s L.R. \n56(a)1  Stmt. ¶ 13  (citing Def.’s Ex. E); Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 13.)  \nAt the time Sullivan disclosed Dr. Seneff as an expert witness, he also produced a copy of \na “Witness Report” from Dr. Seneff. ( Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. ¶ 10; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ \n10.) “ The Witness Report contains an approximately two- page discussion of alleged theoretical \neffects of statin medications on the human body . . . [and] never mentions Plaintiff or Lipitor.” (Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1  Stmt. ¶ 10; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 10.)  Four days before his expert \ndisclosure deadline, Sullivan told Pfizer’s  counsel, by letter dated May 7, 2015, that he had one \nexpert witness report by Dr. Seneff entitled Statins and Myoglobin: How Muscle Pain and Weakness progress to Heart, Lung and Kidney  Failure . (Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1  Stmt. ¶ 11; Pl.’s L.R. \n                                                 \n3 Sullivan adds that Dr. Seneff “has researched and written numerous peer reviewed articles on \nthe dangers of statins” like Lipitor. (Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)1 St mt. ¶ 13.)  Case 3:14-cv-01374-MPS   Document 35   Filed 03/04/16   Page 4 of 95 \n 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 11.)  This report differed from the “ Witness Report ” that Plaintiff  had produced on \nMarch 17, 2015. ( Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1  Stmt. ¶ 11; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 11.) This second report \nis an essay written by Dr. Seneff in 2010, four years prior to the filing of this lawsuit, which also  \ndoes not mention Sullivan. ( Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1  Stmt. ¶ 11; Pl.’s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 11.) Since \nthen, Sullivan has not discl osed any other expert witnesses . (Def.’s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. ¶ 1 2; Pl.’s \nL.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. ¶ 1 2.)  \nOn March 28, 2014, Defenda nt moved for summary judgment , arguing that Sullivan \n“cannot establish the essential element of causation because he has no admissible expert \ntestimony that Lipitor caused any of his alleged injuries.” (ECF No. 24 at 2.)  Sullivan  opposed \nDefendants’ motion for  summary judgment on August 25, 2015, and September 2, 2015. (ECF \nNos. 28- 29.) Defendant filed a reply on September 8, 2015 (ECF No. 31), and Sullivan filed two \nmore replie s on September 16, 2015, and November 19, 2015. (ECF Nos. 33 and 34.)  \nII. STANDARD  \nSummary judgment is appropriate only when “the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matte r of law. ” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating that no genuine issue exists as \nto any material fact. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 323–25 (1986). “ A dispute \nregarding a material fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. ” Williams v. Utica Coll. of Syracuse Univ., 453 F.3d 112, 116 \n(2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In reviewing the record, the court must “ construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non- moving party, ” Breyer v. County \nof Nassau, 524 F.3d 160, 163 (2d Cir. 2008)  (citation omitted) , and “ resolve all ambiguities and \ndraw all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party  . . . .”  Aldrich v.  Randolph Cent. Sch. Dist., Case 3:14-cv-01374-MPS   Document 35   Filed 03/04/16   Page 5 of 96 \n 963 F.2d 520, 523 (2d Cir. 1992)  (citation omitted) . If the moving party carries its burden, “ the \nopposing party must come forward with specific evidence demonstrating the existence of a \ngenuine dispute of material fact. ” Brown v. Eli Lilly & Co. , 654 F.3d 347, 358 (2d Cir. 2011)  \n(citation omitted) . “The mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the [non-\nmovant’s] position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could \nreasonably find for the [ non-moving party].” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 \n(1986) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \nRule 56(c)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that “[a] party asserting \nthat a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the assertion by: citing to particular \nparts of materials in the record . . . .” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). Moreover, “[a]n affidavit or \ndeclaration used to support or oppose a motion must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.” Fed.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Christopher Foster, an inmate using a wheelchair, alleged his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Rehabilitation Act (RA) were violated by the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center (NEOCC). He also claimed breach of contract and sought substantial damages. The court previously dismissed the case because the claims were legally insufficient; now, Foster's motion to reopen the case under Rule 60(b) was denied, as the court found no mistake in its original decision.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the dismissal of Foster's claims was based on a legal or factual mistake that could justify reopening the case under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held there were no mistakes in its prior judgment that would warrant reopening the case under Rule 60(b). Foster's claims against a non-jural entity (NEOCC) were properly dismissed, and his allegations did not meet the necessary legal standards for ADA, RA, or contract violations.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're upset because a place did not accommodate your wheelchair needs, and you take them to court. But you made a mistake by suing a company that can't be legally sued (like trying to sue your couch). The court dismissed your case, saying it wasn’t their fault legally. Now, you ask the court to look at it again, claiming they misunderstood something, but the court checks and finds they didn't make a mistake the first time.",

(Doc. No. 27 (Motion).) In support of the \nmotion, Foster filed an initial memorandum ( id. at 2–61), a “supplemental justice memorandum” \n(Doc. No. 28), a reply (Doc. No. 32), and a “supplemental reply.” (Doc. No. 33 .2) Defendant, \nNortheast Ohio Correctional Center (“NEOCC”), opposes the motion. (Doc. No. 31.) For the \nreasons stated below, the motion is DENIED.  \nI. BACKGROUND3  \n Foster is an inmate at NEOCC in Youngstown, Ohio. (Doc. No. 1 (Complaint), at 5.) Foster \n \n1 All page number references to the record herein are to the consecutive page numbers applied to each individual \ndocument by the Court’s electronic filing system.  \n2 The Court notes that neither Foster’s supplemental justice memorandum (Doc. No. 28) nor his supplemental reply \n(Doc. No. 33) were authorized by the federal, local, or any applicable rules of civil procedure. Nor did Foster seek \nleave from the Court to submit these supplemental filings. Nonetheless, recognizing  Foster’s pro se  status, the Court \nwill consider the arguments made in the supplemental filings. Foster is warned against any more filings outside of the \napplicable rules of civil procedure without first seeking leave from the Court.  \n3 The factual background of this case is more fully set out in the Court’s memorandum opinion and order dismissing \nFoster’s complaint. (Doc. No. 25 (Opinion and Order), at 1 –3.) Instead of repeating the factual background herein, the \nCourt only provides a brief factual and procedural background.   Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  1 of 10.  PageID #: <pageID> \n2 \n has a disability and uses a wheelchair. ( See Doc. No. 23 -1 (Inmate Reasonable Accommodation \nRequest), at 1; see also Doc. No. 1, at 7 (discussing Foster’s mobility device).) Foster alleges that \nNEOCC denied him accommodations for his disability and retaliated against him for seeking such \naccommodations. (Doc. No. 1, at 7 –10.) Foster further alleges the existence of a $5.4 billion  \ncontract, procured from the “Government using promissory fraud against, Plaintiff, the intended \nbeneficiary of the contract.” ( Id. at 2.)  \nOn February 14, 2025, Foster filed the complaint in this action, asserting  a claim for breach \nof contract  and claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”)  and Rehabilitation Act \n(“RA”) . (Doc. No s. 1, 13.) The complaint sought wide ranging relief, including $5.4 billion in \ndamages for the alleged contract  breach  (Doc. No. 1 , at 12 –13), $2,222,222,222 in additional \ndamages, and various forms of equitable relief. ( Id. at 13–14.).  \n The Court dismissed the complaint  on August 8, 2025. (Doc. No. 25.) First, the Court held \nthat Foster could not maintain any claim against NEOCC because it is a non -jural entity . (Id. at 5–\n6.) The Court next held that, even if NEOCC were a jural entity , the complaint failed to set out a \nfacially plausible claim. ( Id. at 6–8.). Specifically, Foster’s ADA claim failed because Title I of \nthe ADA only applies in the employment context, and Titles II and III do not apply to private \nprisons. (Id. at 6–7.) Foster’s RA claim similarly failed because Foster did not  allege that NEOCC \nreceived any federal financial assistance  as required by the RA . (Id. at 7.) Finally, Foster did not \nadequately allege that he was an in tended third -party beneficiary to support his contract claim . (Id. \nat 7–8.)  \n Foster now moves under Rule 60 to reopen the case and vacate the Court’s opinion and \norder based on “the Court’s mistake of law[.]” (Doc. No. 27, at 2.)  Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  2 of 10.  PageID #: <pageID> \n3 \n II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nRule 60 provides various grounds for relief from a final judgment or order. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n60. While the motion is unclear as to which portion of Rule 60 it invokes, the Court construes the \nmotion as one under Rule 60(b)(1) , due to Foster’s claim that the Court made a “mistake of law.” \n(Doc. No. 27, at 2.)  Rule 60(b)(1) provides  that “the court may relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for . . . mistake, inadvertence, surprise, \nor excusable neglect [.]” Fed.  R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1). The Sixth Circuit “ has stated that a Rule 60(b)(1) \nmotion is intended to provide relief in only two situations: (1) when a party has made an excusable \nmistake or an attorney has acted without authority, or (2) when the judge has made a substantive \nmistake of law or fact in the final judgment or order. ” United States v. Reyes , 307 F.3d 451, 455 \n(6th Cir. 2002)  (citation omitted).  \nIII. DISCUS SION  \nAs a preliminary matter, Foster does not assert any excusable mistake or unauthorized act \nof an attorney . Rather, Foster appears to base his motion on an alleged “mistake” by the Court. \n(Doc. No. 27, at 2.) Thus, the Court will only review the motion for potential mistakes of law or \nfact.  \nIn his motion , Foster makes various arguments: (1)  that the defendant in his complaint “has \nbeen the State of Ohio at all times”  (id. at 2),  (2) that CoreCivic , the private company operating \nNEOCC,  is merely Ohio’s “insurance provider” defending it in this suit  (id. at 3–4), (3) that both \nthe ADA and RA apply to the facts of this case  (id. at 5), (4) that Foster  is a third -party beneficiary \nof the alleged contract ( id. at 6), and (5)  that the Court  should have sealed its opinion and order \ndismissing Foster’s complaint . (Doc. No. 32 , at 2 .) Finally, Foster appears to request sanctions Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  3 of 10.  PageID #: <pageID> \n4 \n under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Doc. No. 2 7, at 6.) The Court addresses \neach argument in turn.  \na. Ohio is Not a Defendant in This Case  \nFoster  contends  that the Court misconstrued his complaint as being against NEOCC when \nit was in fact against Ohio. (Doc. No. 27, at 2.) Foster makes various arguments in support of this \ncontention. ( Id. at 2–3; Doc. No. 28, at 1.) But a  simple review of the complaint and docket defeats  \nFoster’s argument. In his complaint and civil cover sheet, Foster lists only “North East \nCorrectional” as the defendant. (Doc. No. 1, at 1; Doc. No. 1 -4 (Civil Cover Sheet) , at 1.) While \nthe Court must liberally construe pro se  pleadings , see Martin v. Overton , 391 F.3d 710, 712 (6th \nCir. 2004)  (citations omitted) , the Court cannot read into the complaint an entirely new defendant . \nSee id. at 714 (“[L]iberal construction does not require a court to conjure allegations on a litigant’s \nbehalf.” (citation omitted)).  \nThe Court further notes that at no point prior to filing the  Rule 60  motion did Foster claim \nthat Ohio was the defendant in this case. Indeed, in his response to NEOCC’s motion to dismiss, \ninstead of arguing that Ohio was the defendant, Foster argued that NEOCC “agreed to assume the \nState’s duties [,]” implicitly recognizing that NEOCC was the defendant. (Doc. No. 22, at 2.) Foster \ncannot use Rule 60 to raise a new argument that he could have raised earlier. See Jinks v. \nAlliedSignal, Inc. , 250 F.3d 381, 387  (6th Cir. 2001) (“Rule 60(b), however, does not provide relief \nsimply because litigants belatedly present new facts or arguments after the district court has made \nits final ruling.” (citation omitted)).  \nThe Court thus made no mistake in construing the complaint to be against NEOCC.  \nFoster’s failure to sue a jural entity forecloses  his claim s and his remaining arguments to reopen Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  4 of 10.  PageID #: <pageID> \n5 \n this case. Nonetheless, the Court will address the remaining  arguments.  \nb. CoreCivic’s Relationship to Ohio Does Not Render Ohio a Defendant  \nFoster next argues that CoreCivic is Ohio’s “insurance provider” and that CoreCivic is \n“defending Ohio’[s] liability[.]” (Doc. No. 27, at 3 –4.) Foster appears to argue  that CoreCivic ’s \nand NEOCC’s involvement in the case is that of an insurer /indemnifier for the real defendant —\nOhio.  \nFoster cites Ohio Rev. Code § 9.06(D)(3) for the proposition that CoreCivic is Ohio’s \ninsurance provider. ( Id. at 3.)  Section 9.06(D) (3) requires that contractors approved to operate \ncertain  prison  facilities “indemnify and hold harmless the state . . . [for] [a]ny constitutional, \nfederal, state, or civil rights claim brought against the state related to the facility operated and \nmanaged by the contractor[.]” Ohio Rev. Code § 9.06(D)(3). But the possibility that CoreCivic \nmay have a duty to indemnify  Ohio i n certain suits does not change the fact that Ohio is not a \nnamed defendant in this case. One cannot sue a party by naming only that party’s indemnifier as a \ndefendant. Again, the Court made no mistake in construing the complain t to be solely against \nNEOCC.  \nc. Foster Did Not Adequately Allege Violations of the ADA or RA  \nFoster next argues that the Court was mistaken in dismissing his ADA and RA claims. In \nresponse to this Court’s holding that Titles II and III of the ADA do not apply to private prisons \n(Doc. No. 25, at 6 –7), Foster argues that “[t]he Sixth Circuit . . . does not regard any such thing as \na private prison.” (Doc. No. 27, at 3 (citing Green v. Cook , 83 F. App’x 99, 101 (6th Cir. 2003).) \nFoster misconstrues Green . Green  simply states that certain conduct of private prison employees \nis attributable to the state  for purposes of liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 . See Green , 83 Fed. Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  5 of 10.  PageID #: <pageID> \n6 \n App’x at 101. It does not say that the Sixth Circuit does not recognize the concept of private \nprisons , and it does not contradict the case law holding  that Titles II and III of the ADA do not \ncover private prisons. (Doc. No. 25, at 6 –7.)  \nFoster next argues that “the ‘State is responsible under Title II.’” (Doc. No. 27, at 3 (quoting \n75 Fed. Reg.  56221  (Sept. 15, 2010) ; citing 42 U.S.C. § 12205a).)  Foster is correct that Title II of \nthe ADA covers public entities, Tennessee v. Lane , 541 U.S. 509, 517, 124 S. Ct. 1978, 158 L. Ed. \n2d 820 (2004) , but Foster has not sued a public entity. He sued a private prison facility that —even \nif it were sui juris —is not a public entity under  the ADA. ( See Doc. No. 25, at 6.) Foster’s argument \nthus fails.  \nFinally, Foster argues generally that the ADA and RA apply . (Doc. No. 27, at 5; Doc. No. \n28, at 3 .) In support of this argument, Foster says only “Plaintiff included all of these terms in his \n[] complaint  and left no need for more question. ” (Doc. No. 27, at 5  (internal record citation \nomitted).) However, neither the complaint nor any of Foster’s filing s provide any reason to upset  \nthe Court’s conclusions that (1) the ADA cannot apply where Foster sued  a private prison facility \n(Doc. No. 25, at 6 –7) and (2)  the RA cannot apply where Foster failed to allege NEOCC received \nany federal financial assistance.4 (Id. at 7.) Foster thus fails to establish any mistake in the Court’s \ndismissal of his ADA and RA claims.  \n \n4 In an apparent attempt to establish NEOCC’s receipt of federal financial assistance, Foster submits an “AI [artificial \nintelligence] Overview” stating that CoreCivic received some funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic \nSecurity (“CARES”) Act. (Doc. No. 27-1.) Assuming, without deciding, that CARES Act funds could constitute \nfederal financial assistance under the RA, this Court holds Foster’s post-judgment submission of the “AI Overview” \ninsufficient to establish NEOCC’s receipt of federal financial assistance or a mistake by the Court. See Price v. Dep't \nof Corr. , No. 22 -cv-10219, 2025 WL 400046, at *2 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 5, 2025) (finding no error in magistrate’s \ndisregard of “AI Overview” on summary judgment).  Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  6 of 10.  PageID #: <pageID> \n7 \n d. Foster Did Not Adequately Allege That He Was a Third -Party Beneficiary  \n  Foster argues that the Court was mistaken in dismissing his breach of contract claim. \nFoster argues that Ohio entered an agreement for the receipt of federal funds in return for a promise \nto not discriminate, and as an intended beneficiary of that agreemen t, Foster is entitled to damages  \nfor breach of that promise . (Doc. No. 28, at 3–4; Doc. No. 33, at 2.)  As this Court already stated, \nFoster’s status as an inmate alone does not render him an intended third -party beneficiary to any \ncontract. (Doc. No. 25,  at 7–8.) And, a s will be discussed below, none of Foster’s cited case law \nchanges this conclusion.  \nFoster first cites Barnes v. Gorman , 536 U.S. 181, 189, 122 S. Ct. 2097, 153 L. Ed. 2d 230 \n(2002)  and Green , 83 F. App'x at 101. Neither  advance s Foster’s cause.  First, t he Supreme Court \nin Barnes simply  noted that, when assessing liability and available damages in cases brought under \nstatutes authorized by the Constitution’s Spending Clause , the Court often uses the analogy of a \nbreach -of-contract claim on a third -party  beneficiary theory. See Barnes , 536 U.S. at 186–87. \nSecond, i n Green , the Sixth Circuit simply affirmed a  district court ’s dismissal of a § 1983 claim  \nalleging Eighth Amendment violations . See Green , 83 F. App'x at 100–01. Nothing in Barnes or \nGreen  helps Foster establish his status a s a third -party beneficiary.  \n Nor does  Cullen v. Hyatte , No. 3:23 -cv-918, 2025 WL 816632 (N.D. Ind. Mar. 14, 2025)  \nhelp Foster . In Cullen , the district court held that the plaintiff adequately pleaded a third -party \nbeneficiary claim by pleading: (1) defendant’s contract with the state obligated defendant to \nmonitor inmate communication s for potential safety risks, (2) that obligation was intended to \nbenefit inmates in the state’s custody, and  (3) defendant breached that obligation. Id. at *5. Cullen , \nhowever, is distinguishable  from th e present case . Whereas the Cullen  plaintiff pointed to specific Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  7 of 10.  PageID #: <pageID> \n8 \n language in the applicable contracts showing an obligation to a third party , see id. , Foster fails to \npoint to any specific language in any contract  and provides only conclusory allegations of his third -\nparty  beneficiary status. Such pleading is insufficient.  See Adams v. CoreCivic of Tennessee, LLC , \nNo. 3:23 -cv-823, 2024 WL 253616, at *6 (M.D. Tenn. Jan. 23, 2024)  (dismissing third -party  \nbeneficiary contract claim where plaintiff provided “only conclusory assertions that the contracting \nparties are under a legal duty to all [] inmates”).  \n Finally, Foster relies on  the Ohio Supreme Court case of  DeCastro v. Wellston City Sch. \nDist. Bd. of Ed uc., 761 N.E.2d 612, 617  (Ohio 2002) . (Doc. No. 32, at 4; Doc. No. 33, at 3.)  While \nDeCastro involved a third -party beneficiary contract claim, id. at 614, the Ohio Supreme Court \naddressed only a single narrow issue: “whether nominal damages can be recovered where actual \nmonetary damages cannot be proven in a breach of contract claim.”  Id. at 615. It did not address \nthe pleading standard for a third -party beneficiary contract claim. DeCastro  thus does not help \nFoster.  \n The Court made no mistake of law or fact in dismissing Foster’s breach of contract claim.  \ne. The Court’s Prior Opinion Need Not be Sealed  \n In his reply brief, Foster appears to argue that the Court’s opinion and order (Doc. No. 25) \nshould have been sealed . (Doc. No. 32, at 2.) The public has both “a constitutional and a common \nlaw presumptive right of access to civil proceedings and judicial records.” In re S e. Milk Antitrust \nLitig ., 666 F.  Supp.  2d 908, 915 (E.D.  Tenn.  2009) ( citing Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. \nFed. Trade Comm ’n, 710 F.2d 1165, 1179 (6th Cir. 1983)).  This presumption “is particularly \nstrong when judicial opinions, rather than other court filings, are at issue.” Sec. & Exch. Comm'n \nv. Abdallah , No. 1:14 -cv-1155, 2015 WL 12766492, at *2 (N.D. Ohio May 19, 2015) . “Only the Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  8 of 10.  PageID #: <pageID> \n9 \n most compelling reasons can justify non -disclosure of judicial records.”  Rose v. Bunts , No. 4:14 -\ncv-82, 2014 WL 2964938, at *5 (N.D. Ohio June 30, 2014)  (quoting In re Knoxville News –Sentinel \nCo., Inc. , 723 F.2d 470, 476 (6th Cir.  1983) ).  \nFoster provides no compelling reason for sealing any portion of the Court’s opinion and \norder. Foster appears to argue that the Court’s opinion and order should have been sealed because \nit cites some records that are potentially confidential.  (See Doc. No. 32, at 2 (citing Ohio Admin. \nCode § 5120 -9-31(H)  (“[g]rievance records are considered confidential[.]” )).) But the mere fact \nthat a document references  potentially confidential information does not, by itself, warrant sealing. \nSee e.g., Dahmer v. W. Kentucky Univ. , No. 1 :18-cv-124, 2020 WL 12813747, at *2 (W.D. Ky. \nSept. 25, 2020)  (citing Shane Grp., Inc. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan , 825 F.3d 299 , 307 \n(6th Cir. 2016) ). Beyond his claims of confidentiality, Foster only states that the opinion and order \n“exposes dangerous terms . . . of a very serious nature” without explaining what those terms are \nor what danger they pose. (Doc. No. 32, at 2.) These conclusory statements fall far short of the \ncompelling reason s needed to seal a judicial record . See Ellis v. Clinton Cnty. Bd. of Comm ’rs, No. \n1:23-cv-341, 2024 WL 4453397, at *1 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 24, 2024)  (denying motion to seal where \nmovant “only provides conclusory reasons why these compelling reasons exist.”). The Court thus \nmade no mistake in failing to sua sponte  seal its opinion and order.5 \nf. Foster ’s Request for Rule 11 Sanctions  is Procedurally Defective  \nThough unclear, Foster appears to move for sanctions against defense counsel under Rule \n11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Doc. No. 27, at 6.) According to Foster, defense \n \n5 The Court also notes that the only factual material the Court cited in its opinion and order were documents publicly \nfiled by Foster himself. Foster never sought to seal any of his filings. Foster does not explain how the Court’s  citation \nto documents that are already publicly filed can render its opinion and order sealable under applicable law.  Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  9 of 10.  PageID #: <pageID> \n10 \n \ncounsel gave this Court an “erroneous view of the law.” ( Id. at 5 (citation omitted).) But “[a] \nmotion for sanctions [under Rule 11] must be made separately from any other motion and must \ndescribe the specific conduct that allegedly violates Rule 11(b).” Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c)(2). Foster \nhas failed to file a separate motion for sanctions , and he has f ailed to describe the specific conduct \nthat allegedly violates Rule 11(b) . To the extent Foster seeks sanctions under Rule 11, such \nsanctions are denied.   \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFoster fails to identify  any mistake of law or fact in this Court’s opinion and order \ndismissing Foster’s claims. Accordingly, Foster’s motion to reopen under Rule 60 (Doc. No. 2 7) \nis DENIED.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \n \nDated: October 14, 2025     \n HONORABLE SARA LIOI  \nCHIEF JUDGE  \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \n \n Case: 4:25-cv-00295-SL  Doc #: 34  Filed:  10/14/25  10 of 10.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Sybrena Evans versus Danielle Robertson and others, the court addresses multiple motions including alternate service, extending the summons, and anonymity of parties involved. The plaintiff, Evans, filed the lawsuit pro se, charging Robertson with copyright infringement, defamation, fraud, and harassment, further complicated by inaccurate legal citations presumably aided by AI software. The court found no basis for Robertson to proceed anonymously but allowed her to use a registered agent to protect her physical location.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Robertson can proceed anonymously to protect her identity and privacy interests due to alleged harassment by Evans, and whether Evans's use of AI-generated legal content compromised the court proceedings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Robertson the right to proceed anonymously and instructed her to disclose her legal name and address for official court communications, while also ensuring privacy by allowing a registered agent's address. Additionally, it directed both parties to verify citations manually and refrain from using inaccurate AI-generated legal content.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A woman named Sybrena Evans is suing Danielle Robertson and others for things like stealing ideas and being mean online. Evans tried to use AI text to make her legal documents but ended up including fake details. The court is telling Robertson she can't hide her real name if she wants to defend herself, but she can still keep her home address private. The court also told both sides to double-check any info they use, so they're not making stuff up by accident with AI tools.",

ECF No. 1.  The Honorable Judith E. Levy referred \nthe case to the undersigned for all pretrial matters under 28 U.S.C. \n§636(b)(1).  ECF No. 7 .\n1 Robertson made a special appearance as a Jane Doe stating that \n“Danielle Robertson” is not her legal name.  ECF No. 28, PageID.183.  For \nthe sake of clarity, the Court will refer to the defendant  as Robertson.

ECF No. 31.   The Court \ninitially denied Doe’s requests to proceed anonymously and ordered him to \ndisclose his identity.  ECF No. 38.   But the  Court later granted Doe’s motion  \nto quash  on procedural grounds, as discovery was premature .  ECF No. \n62.Evans’s motion to strike the motion to quash is DENIED as moot.  In\nany event, the proper course would not have been to strike Doe’s motion but to reassess whether he showed that h is privacy interests outweighed \nthe presumption favoring disclosure of his identity.  \nEvans also moves to compel disclosure of Doe’s identity, arguing that \nhe should not be permitted to proceed anonymously.  ECF No. 50.  And \nDoe moves for reconsideration of the Court’s order denying his request to \nproceed anonymously.  ECF No. 54.  He also  presented similar arguments \nin objections  to the order.  ECF No. 63.  Judge Levy addressed those \nobjections and held  that “Doe may remain anonymous at this time.”   ECF \nNo. 72.  Because Judge Levy addressed the overlapping arguments made in his objections, Doe’s motion for reconsideration is DENIED  as moot.   \nLikewise, Evans’s motion to compel Doe to reveal his identity is DENIED  as \nmoot.

A party or other individual seeking to proceed under a \npseudonym must satisfy a heavy burden, showing that his “‘privacy \ninterests substantially outweigh the presumption of open judicial \nproceedings.’”  Doe v.

Courts consider:  \n(1) whether the [parties] seeking anonymity are suing to\nchallenge governmental activity; (2) whether prosecution of the\nsuit will compel the [parties] to disclose information of theutmost intimacy; (3) whether the litigation compels [the parties]to disclose an intention to violate the law, thereby risking\ncriminal prosecution; and (4) whether the [parties] are children.\nPorter , 370 F.3d at 560 (cleaned up). Also relevant is  whether the party \nopposing anonymity will be prejudiced by  “being forced to proceed with \ninsufficient information to present their arguments.”  Citizens for a Strong \nOhio v. Marsh , 123 F. App’x 630, 636 (6th Cir. 2005)  (cleaned up) . \nThe first, third, and fourth factors do not favor permitting Robertson to \nproceed anonymously.  The case does not concern  government activity, \nthe civil action will not expose Robertson to criminal prosecution, and \nRobertson is an adult.  Case 5:24-cv-13435-JEL-EAS   ECF No. 74, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/25/25   Page 3 of 144 \n Although Robertson does not claim that the litigation will require her \nto disclose sensitive information, she argues that Evans has harassed and \nstalked her online.  ECF No. 28, PageID.184-191; ECF No. 49, \nPageID.468, 479- 480.  “To proceed anonymously for fear of retaliation and \nharassment a [party]  must demonstrate that retaliation is not merely \nhypothetical but based in some real -word evidence; a simple fear is \ninsufficient.”  John Does 1- 4 v. Snyder , No. 12-11194 , 2012 WL 1344412, \nat *2 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 18, 2012) (cleaned up).   Parties seeking to proceed \nanonymously can satisfy this burden  “by demonstrating the need for \nanonymity to prevent retaliation, the reasonableness of [their]  fear, the \nseverity of the threatened harm, and [their]  vulnerability.”   Id.

ECF \nNo. 28 -2, PageID.226 -240.  The exact meaning of most messages is \nunclear.  But the parties  discussed a social media collaboration where \nEvans would appear as  Robertson’s “twin.”  Id., PageID.226 -232.  They \nhad a disagreement, which ended with Robertson blocking Evans.  Id., \nPageID.233 -240.  Robertson contends that she initially responded to Case 5:24-cv-13435-JEL-EAS   ECF No. 74, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/25/25   Page 4 of 145 \n Evans’s ideas cordially but made clear that she was uninterested in a \ncollaboration.  Id., PageID.240; ECF No. 28, PageID.188.  \nAs discussed in the report and recommendation (R&R), the Court \ncannot consider URLs linking to media exhibits.  See ECF No. 28 -2, \nPageID.225.  But the Court notes that Evans has posted dozens of \nYouTube videos about Robertson and this case, with the most recent \npublished just days ago.  ECF No. 28 -2, PageID.241 -245; ECF No. 28 -3, \nPageID.246 -268; ECF No. 28 -4, PageID.26 9-279.2  Many videos tag \nRobertson and link to her own YouTube accounts.  Id.  Robertson contends \nthat Evans is interfering with her “branding”  and is collaborating with others \nfor targeted harassment and doxxing.  ECF No. 28, PageID.186 -187.  \nRobertson also claims that Evans has made comments  in her videos  like, \n“When [Robertson’s] identity is revealed, I said I don’t care who does it first, just that it’s done and that she’s held accountable.”  Id. , PageID.185.  \nTo be sure, Evans’ s many  videos evince an unusual fixation on  \nRobertson and  the dispute.  But Robertson has not shown how disclosing \nher legal name would aggravate  matters.   Any harm to Robertson’s \nYouTube channels through tagging and doxxing is  already being done.   \n \n2 See https://www.youtube.com/@unwinewithteddy/videos (last visited \nSeptember 17, 2025).  Case 5:24-cv-13435-JEL-EAS   ECF No. 74, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/25/25   Page 5 of 146 And it is unclear w hether Evans  meant to threaten Robertson rather than  \nhoping to hold her  legally accountable.  Evans’s activities have  been  \nconfined to the internet; there is no allegation of physical stalking  or threats \nof physical harm .  See Doe v. Kamehameha Schs. , 596 F.3d 1036, 1045 \n(9th Cir. 2010) (online threats did not reasonably give rise to fear of severe \nharm, as “many times people say things anonymously on the internet that \nthey would never say in another context and have no intention of carrying out”); Doe v. Felician Univ. , No. 2:18-CV-13539 , 2019 WL 2135959, at * 4 \n(D.N.J. May 15, 2019)  (a blog that sought to expose a plaintiff’s identity did \nnot reasonably give rise to fear of harm, although “the blog post and comments [were] filled with hate speech and offensive comments”) .   \nAt the same time, the Court is sensitive to Robertson’s privacy \nconcerns.  Even if Robertson disclose s her legal name, she may retain a \nregistered agent to accept delivery of legal documents to protect her physical location from disclosure.  Without Robertson’s location, it is \nunlikely that Evans  or her followers  could threaten her physical safety.  See \nBird v. Barr, No. 19 -cv-1581, 2019 WL 2870234, at *5 -6 (D.D.C. July 3, \n2019) (when a plaintiff did not show that her physical safety or ability to perform her job would be compromised, her privacy was appropriately Case 5:24-cv-13435-JEL-EAS   ECF No. 74, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/25/25   Page 6 of 147 shielded by permitting her to seal her address rather than proceed \na\nnonymously) . \nLast, Evans would be prejudiced if Robertson proceed ed \nanonymously.  Robertson seeks dismissal of the action by arguing  that she \nhas not been properly named in the litigation.  ECF No. 28, PageID.183, \n185; ECF No. 49, PageID.469.  As discussed in the R&R, Robertson has used several aliases and addresses to evade service.  Robertson cannot have it both ways.  She may not use anonymity simultaneously as a shield \nto protect her privacy and  as a sword to undermine the litigation .  And \nwithout knowing Robertson’ s identity or home address, any judgment \nEvans might obtain could be  unenforceable.  \nThus, the Court GRANTS  Ev\n ans’s motion s to compel disclosure of \nRobertson’s identity .  By November 3, 2025 , Robertson must file a notice \nidentifying her legal name and postal address.  But for privacy purposes, Robertson may retain a registered agent and use that address.  The Court \nDENIES  Evans’s motion to strike Robertson’s filings made under her alias.  \nC.P\nrotective Order\nRobertson moves for a protective order seeking various forms of \nrelief.   ECF No. 28, PageID.184- 191.  Rule 26(c)(1) allows a party from \nwhom discovery is sought to move for a protective order to protect it from Case 5:24-cv-13435-JEL-EAS   ECF No. 74, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/25/25   Page 7 of 148 “annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden.”  The movant \nb\nears the burden of showing good cause for a protective order.  Nix v. \nSword , 11 F. App’x 498, 500 (6th Cir. 2001).  “To show good cause, a \nmovant for a protective order must articulate specific facts showing ‘clearly defined and serious injury’ resulting from the discovery sought and cannot \nrely on mere conclusory statements.”  Id . (cleaned up).  Courts enjoy \n“broad discretion to decide when a protective order is appropriate and what \ndegree of protection is required.”  Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart , 467 U.S. \n20, 36 (1984) (cleaned up).  In exercising that discretion, a court must \nbalance the competing interests and hardships of the parties.  Am. Gen. \nLife Ins. Co. v. Harshman , 299 F.R.D. 157, 158 (E.D. Ky. 2014).  \nRobertson first seeks to prevent Evans from engaging in discovery \nbefore a Rule 26(f) conference and to quash any third -party subpoenas \nEvans may have already issued.  ECF No. 28, PageID.191.  As determined in a previous order, discovery is precluded before the parties confer under \nRule 26(f).  ECF No. 62, citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(d)(1)).  Thus, Evans may \nnot yet engage in discovery, and any third -party subpoenas already issued \nmust be quashed. \nNext, Robertson requests a blanket order enjoining Evans from \npublicly disclosing any materials she obtains in discovery, “including Case 5:24-cv-13435-JEL-EAS   ECF No. 74, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/25/25   Page 8 of 149 metadata or identifying records.”  ECF No. 28, PageID.191.  Because it is \nu\nnclear what kind of information Robertson seeks to protect, the Court \ncannot assess whether good cause exists.  \nLast, Robertson seeks injunctive relief, including  barring Evans from \naccessing Robertson’s YouTube channels or restraining her from \ncontacting or harassing Robertson.  ECF No. 28, PageID.191.   That relief \ndoes not relate to discovery conduct, so a protective order is inappropriate.  \nBut if Evans engages in harassing or abusive discovery tactics, Robertson \nmay move for sanctions, including dismissal, for violating discovery orders, \nprocedural rules, or court orders under Rule 37(b) -(c) or Rule 41(b).  \nThus, Robertson’s motion for protective order is GRANTED IN PART \nAND DENIED IN PART. \nD.Alternate Service & Extending the Summons\nRule 4(m) provides that “if a defendant is not served within 90 days \nafter the complaint is filed, the court  must dismiss the action without \nprejudice against that defendant or order that service be made within a \nspecified time.”  But if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure to serve, the Court must  extend the time for service.  Id. (emphasis added).  \nFor the reasons discussed in the R&R regarding alternate service, Evans has shown good cause for failing to serve.  The Court thus extends the Case 5:24-cv-13435-JEL-EAS   ECF No. 74, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/25/25   Page 9 of 1410 summons and the time to serve until October 8,  2025.  By that date, Evans \nmust serve Robertson at her email address —\ndanimontana2022@gmail.com —with copies of the summons, complaint, \nthe R&R, and this order.  Evans must also file a notice with evidence \nconfirming that email was sent.  \nE.Fa ctitious Citations\nThe Court notes that the parties’  briefing contained multiple factitious \ncitations and quotations, presumably a product of using artificial intelligence \n(AI) software.  For example, Evans cites Aguirre v. Reese , No. 2:12 -cv-\n01837, 2013 WL 6577085, at *5 (D. Nev. Dec. 13, 2013).  ECF No. 64, PageID.559.  The citation is nonexistent, and the District of Nevada assigned that case number to Mazzorana v. Emergency Med. Phys. Grp. , \nin which no filings were made on December 13, 2013.  Next, Evans attributed the following quote to Doe v. F.B.I. , 218 F.R.D. 256 (D. Colo. \n2003): “Parties may not evade service by hiding behind pseudonyms while \ncontinuing to engage in legal actions using those same identities.”  ECF \nNo. 64, PageID.561.  That case contains no such language, nor has the Court found th at language in any other case.  Evans likewise misattributes \nquotations to two other cases.  ECF No. 64, PageID.570 -571 (citing United Case 5:24-cv-13435-JEL-EAS   ECF No. 74, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/25/25   Page 10 of 1411 States v. Ziegler Bolt & Parts Co. ,  111 F.3d 878 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Sec. & \nExchange Comm’n v. Knowles , 87 F.3d 413 (10th Cir. 1996)).  \nRobertson’s filings also contain inaccurate citations.  She cites \nMickens v. 10th Jud. Dist. Ct. , 460 F. App’x 728 (9th Cir. 2011), in support \nof her argument that courts may dismiss actions used to harass or \nintimidate rather than to vindicate legitimate claims.  ECF No. 39, \nPageID.352.  Although two case s by that title exist, Robertson’s  citation is \ninaccurate.   See Mickens v. 10th Jud. Cir. Ct. , 458 F. App’x 839 (11th Cir. \n2012); Mickens v. 10th Jud. Cir. , 181 F. App’x 865 (11th Cir. 2006).   The \ncases we re decided by the Eleventh Circuit and concern the application of \nthe Rooker -Feldman doctrine and not dismissal of abusive litigation.   \nRobertson also cites McNair v. Everly , No. 18 -12511, 2019 WL 2560069 \n(E.D. Mich. June 20, 2019), which  does not exist.  ECF No. 71, \nPageID.686.  This district assigned that case number to Arnold v. Fresh \nStart Transitional Homes , in which no filings were made on June 20, 2019. \nRobertson’s filings  also contain other inaccura cies that the Court will not \nbelabor here.  \n“[F]or a pro se litigant especially, AI software offers a tempting tool to \noffset the disadvantage of appearing in an unfamiliar court setting.”  Everett J.Prescott, Inc. v. Beall , No. 1:25 -cv-00071, 2025 WL 2084353, at *2 (D.Case 5:24-cv-13435-JEL-EAS   ECF No. 74, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 09/25/25   Page 11 of 1412 Me. July 24, 2025).  Yet “a pro se litigant must not provide the Court with \ne\nrroneous and factitious citations and has an obligation to review \ndocuments filed with the Court to make certain they are scrupulously accurate.”  Id.  Failure to do so disrupts the Court’s timely and efficient \nreview of cases, as its efforts are wasted researching nonexistent citations \nand legal principles.   \nWhile pro se litigants are typically afforded a measure of latitude, that \nleniency is not boundless.  Pilgrim v. Littlefield , 92 F.3d 413, 416 (6th Cir. \n1996).  Pro se parties are expected to strictly follow procedural rules, and no authority suggests that those rules “should be interpreted so as to \nexcuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel.”  McNeil v. United \nStates , 508 U.S. 106, 113 (1993).  If an attorney had submitted a brief \nlittered with inaccurate citations, Federal Rule of Civil Procedur e 11 \nsanctions would have been appropriate.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In this case, Plaintiff Zonna Lee filed a lawsuit against her former employer, ElectrifAi, LLC, and its associates, claiming various forms of retaliation and wrongful termination. The case highlights the involvement of AI, as Plaintiff alleged that ElectrifAi's AI products, which she was responsible for selling, were fraudulent, as they were not truly AI-powered but rather operated manually. The court dismissed most of Lee’s claims due to insufficiencies in pleading, including lack of specific allegations regarding discrimination or unlawful conduct.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the plaintiff’s complaint sufficiently establishes claims of retaliation, discrimination, and wrongful termination under Title VII, NJLAD, CEPA, and other legal theories, and whether any of the products her role involved are fraudulent in their advertised AI functionality.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss, dismissing the majority of the claims without prejudice due to insufficient allegations that failed to establish plausible claims of discrimination or retaliation. Claims dismissed with prejudice include those against individual defendants where Title VII does not provide individual liability.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a job where you're supposed to sell really cool robot products that the company claims can think for themselves. If you find out that these robots are actually people in costume, and then you get fired from your job, you might complain that your firing was unfair or based on you speaking out. In this case, the person telling the story didn't explain well enough why their firing was illegal or unfair according to the rules, so the judge couldn't let the case continue.",

BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nPlaintiff, a Caucasian woman, is a former employee of ElectrifAi.1  (Am. Compl. ¶ 3).  \nPlaintiff was sixty -six years old while she worked for ElectrifAi.2  (Id.).  Over multiple weeks in \nFebruary, March, and April 2022, Plaintiff spoke with (i) Scott, ElectrifAi’s Chief Executive \nOfficer, (ii) Clark, ElectrifAi’s General Counsel and head of Human Resources, (iii) Agarwal, ElectrifAi’s Executive Vice President and  Head of Products and Alliances, and (iv) Wang, \nElectrifAi’s Chief Technology Officer, regarding her working in an executive sales capacity for ElectrifAi.  ( Id. ¶¶ 6 -9, 16).  During these discussions, Plaintiff was “repeatedly advised” \nElectrifAi’s products were machine learning or AI, and that her position would involve selling these products.  ( Id. ¶ 17).  Plaintiff also informed the Individual Defendants about her “medical \ncondition, which made it unsafe to receive a Covid -19 vaccine and thus unable to travel by plane.”  \n(Id. ¶ 19).  \nOn April 9, 2022, Plaintiff received an offer letter from ElectrifAi to work as a “Senior \nAccount Manager.”  ( Id. ¶ 20).  The offer letter provided, in relevant part: “This offer letter does \nnot create or imply any contract of employment, and your employment with the Company will at all times be on an ‘at -will’ basis.”  (ECF No. 27-1 at ¶ 8).   \nPlaintiff accepted ElectrifAi’s offer and returned a signed Offer Letter on or  around April \n12, 2022, and started  on May 2, 2022.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 23). \n When she began working at ElectrifAi, \nPlaintiff alleges her job title was changed to “Senior Director of Business Development” and then again, on May 19, 2022, to “Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Strategy.”  ( Id. ¶¶ 34 -35).  \nPlaintiff alleges Scott advised her the title was changed a third time “because her former title(s) \n \n1 The following factual allegations are taken from the Amended Complaint that are accepted as true.  Sheridan v. NGK \nMetals Corp., 609 F.3d 239, 262 n.27 (3d Cir. 2010).  \n2 Plaintiff alleges ElectrifAi is owned by White Oak.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 11).  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 2 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>3 \n did not have enough ‘push’ behind them to be of use while contacting clients.”  ( Id. ¶ 36).  Other \nthan the change of title, her position was identical in all “material respects,” including her pay and \nbenefits.  ( Id. ¶ 37).   \nPlaintiff further alleges her efforts to make sales were “significantly hindered” from the \nbeginning.  ( Id. ¶ 40).  Plaintiff was not provided “specific information” about how ElectrifAi’s \nproducts worked.  ( Id.).  Additionally, the Executive Committee took prospective clients away \nfrom the sales team when prospective clients indicated they were interested in purchasing ElectrifAi’s products.  ( Id. ¶ 42).  \nFurther, while working for ElectrifAi, Plaintiff alleges she learned information about \nElectrifAi’s dysfunctional and fraudulent products.  ( Id. ¶¶ 49 -53).  For instance, Plaintiff was \nadvised by “client -facing staff” that several of the machine learning/AI products “were not \nworking properly.”  ( Id. ¶ 49).  Thereafter, Plaintiff was advised by an ElectrifAi employee that \nthe products “were not actually operated by machine learning or artificial intelligence but rather \nby manual labor, and that ElectrifAi c ould not afford to staff these products sufficiently, resulting \nin several products losing functionality.”   (Id. ¶ 50).  Additionally, Plaintiff was informed by \nanother ElectrifAi employee that ElectrifAi was actually selling services, rather than products, like the one using machine learning/AI.  ( Id. ¶ 51).   \nPlaintiff also alleges the Individual Defendants disregarded her advice to (i) utilize \nstandardized systems for data storage, communications, and customer relationship management (“CRM”); (ii) hire a Salesforce Administrator to design a customized CRM system; or (iii) replace or reduce the number of unproductive assistants.  ( Id. ¶¶ 54 -66).  Additionally, Plaintiff alleges she \nwas provided “contradictory instructions” that restricted her ability to properly perform her position and left her “guessing” what was expected by ElectrifAi.  ( Id. ¶¶ 73 -88).   Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 3 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>4 \n Moreover, Plaintiff alleges the work environment at ElectrifAi “was incredibly hostile in \nthat she was subject to rampant discriminatory, offensive, threatening language used by \nexecutives.”  ( Id. ¶89).  During daily videoconference or telephone meetings that Scott oversaw  \nand “less inclusive internal calls” with the Individual Defendants, Plaintiff alleges Scott regularly made “comments that were discriminatory on their face” and reflected “an obvious disdain for people of certain races, sexes, disabilities, and ages.”  ( Id. ¶¶ 90 -91).  For instance, in a client \nmeeting, Scott asked a potential client: “Are you Iranian?”  ( Id. ¶ 92).  Additionally, Scott \n“admonished Plaintiff in front of a large group of ElectrifAi employees as being ‘too stupid to understand’ something he mentioned.”  ( Id. ¶ 97).  Scott also regularly and publicly screamed at \ncertain members of ElectrifAi’s sales team.  ( Id. ¶ 99).   \nOn August 21, 2022, Plaintiff sent the Individual Defendants an email outlining the status \nof her calls made the previous Friday and upcoming email campaigns.  ( See ECF 27 -3 at 5 -6).  \nAfter Agarwal and Wang responded with follow -up questions and recommendations, Scott sent an \nemail regarding ElectrifAi’s “target list” and potential clients to contact.  ( Id. at 3-5).  Scott also \nstated:  \nIf I told you the amount of time it takes me to penetrate you would be shocked.  It’s \nstarts with a hook of what I call “industrial logic” as to why someone should take a meeting.. (sic) If you think you are good to send an untrained inside sales executives \nwith a random email who does not understand the client’s business and exactly how NLP, CV and Machine Learning can quickly drive value – you’re kidding yourself.  \nThere has to be basic  prep and I have not seen the sales team do that.  Talk to every \nperso n who responded to me and they will invariably say “there was something that \nstruck a chord in Ed’s note or phone call”.  \n It’s not done by chance.  It’s preparation.  We need visibility to Ms. Lee ASAP.  Rahul will manage and handle her one way or the other.   \n Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 4 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>5 \n (Id. at 3).  On August 22, 2022, Plaintiff “immediately objected” to Scott’s email and responded \nto the accusations that she was untrained and “operating without visibility from leadership.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 108; see also ECF No. 27- 3 at 1 -3).   \n Plaintiff remained “uncomfortable” and believed the email “was one of many instances of \nharassment perpetrated by the Executive Committee.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 109 -10).  As such, Plaintiff \nscheduled a n August 25, 2022 meeting with the Human Resources representative and  discussed \nScott’s email and why Plaintiff believed it constituted harassment.  ( Id. ¶¶ 112, 114).  The Human \nResources representative indicated the contents of the meeting were “strictly confidential” and she “would explore the actions of [Scott ] and address them accordingly.”  ( Id. ¶¶ 113, 115).  \nApproximately three hours after the meeting, Plaintiff was terminated and advised “her ‘position’ had been ‘eliminated.’”  ( Id. ¶¶ 116 -17).   \n After her termination, Plaintiff alleges many of her prospective new employers would have \ncontacted her supervisors at ElectrifAi to discuss her qualifications or explain her “abrupt tenure.”  \n(Id. ¶ 122).  Plaintiff alleges ElectrifAi has attempted to ruin her reputation by “using false or \nmisleading statements which mischaracterize her tenure at ElectrifAi and/or her qualifications to continue working in an executive sales capacity for other companies.”  ( Id. ¶ 123).  Plaintiff further \nalleges ElectrifAi has reported “false, misleading, or otherwise erroneous information to various \nfederal or state agencies,” which has deprived her of the ability to collect unemployment and insurance.  ( Id. ¶ 125).  Additionally, Plaintiff alleges she was required to visit the hospital in \nFebruary 2023 for an irregular heartbeat, which “was obviously related to the stress Plaintiff experienced while working at ElectrifAi and immediately after her Termination. ”  (Id. ¶ 129).  \n On April 21, 2023, Plaintiff filed her initial complaint.  (ECF No. 1).  After ElectrifAi, \nWhite Oak, Clark, Agarwal, and Wang indicated they intended to file motions to dismiss for failure Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 5 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>6 \n to state a claim, (ECF Nos. 14, 22), Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on September 13, 2023 \n(ECF No. 27).  The Amended Complaint alleges ten causes of action: (i) retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq.  (“Title VII”) (Count One); (ii) retaliation \nunder New Jersey’s Law Against Discrimination, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 10:5-1, et seq.  (“NJLAD”) \n(Count Two); (iii) retaliation in violation of public policy under Pierce v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 416 A.2d 505 (N.J. 1980) (Count Three); (iv) violation of the Conscientious Employee Protection Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19-1, et seq.  (“CEPA”) (Count Four); (v) hostile work \nenvironment under Title VII (Count Five); (vi) hostile work environment under NJLAD (Count Six); (vii) intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count Seven); (viii) fraudulent misrepresentation (Count Eight); ( ix) defamation (Count Nine); and (x) breach of the implied \nwarranty of good faith and fair dealing (Count Ten).  (ECF No. 27).     On October 13, 2023, Defendants filed the pending motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 32-34), which Plaintiff opposed (ECF Nos. 41- 43), to which Defendants replied.  (ECF Nos. 47- 48, 50).\n3  \nThis matter is now ripe for consideration.  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nRule 8 requires that a pleading include “a short and plain statement of the claim showing \nthat the pleader is entitled to relief” and provide the defendant with “fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests[.]” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)  \n \n3 The Court will refer to the parties’ respective motion papers as the following:  \n•  White Oak’s brief in support of its motion (ECF No. 32) will be referred to as “White Oak Br.”;  \n•  Plaintiff’s opposition to White Oak’s motion (ECF No. 42) will be referred to as “Opp’n to White Oak”;  \n•  White Oak’s reply brief (ECF No. 50) will be referred to as “White Oak Reply”;  \n•  ElectrifAi, Clark, Agarwal, and Wang’s brief in support of their motion (ECF No. 33) will be referred to as \n“ElectrifAi Br.”;  \n•  Plaintiff’s opposition to ElectrifAi’s brief (ECF No. 41) will be referred to as “Opp’n to ElectrifAi”;  \n•  ElectrifAi, Clark, Agarwal, and Wang’s reply brief (ECF No. 47) will be referred to as “ElectrifAi Reply”;  \n•  Scott’s brief in support of his motion (ECF No. 34) will be referred to as “Scott Br.”;  \n•  Plaintiff’s opposition to Scott’s brief (ECF No. 43) will be referred to as “Opp’n to Scott”; and  \n•  Scott’s reply brief (ECF No. 48) will be referred to as “Scott Reply”.   Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 6 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>7 \n (cleaned up) .  On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the “facts alleged must be taken as true” and dismissal \nis not appropriate where “it appears unlikely that the plaintiff can prove those facts or will \nultimately prevail on the merits.”  Phillips v. Cnty. Of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 231 (3d Cir. 2008) \n(citation omitted).  A complaint will survive a motion to dismiss if it provides a sufficient factual basis to state a facially plausible claim for relief.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).     \nIn analyzing the sufficiency of a complaint, the Third Circuit requires that courts engage \nin a three- part inquiry: (1) recite the elements that must be pled in order to state a claim; (2) \ndetermine which allegations in the complaint are merely conclusory and therefore need not be given an assumption of truth; and (3) “assume the[] veracity” of well -pleaded factual allegations \nand ascertain whether they plausibly “give rise to an entitlement for relief.”  Santiago v. Warminster Twp., 629 F.3d 121, 130 (3d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted).   \nIII. DISCUSSION\n4 \nA. Plaintiff Fails to Plead Plausible Title VII Claims (Counts One and Five)  \nThe Court first considers Plaintiff’s retaliation and hostile work environment claims under \nTitle VII.  As a threshold matter, Title VII requires a plaintiff bringing an action against an employer to first file an action with the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged conduct.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -5(e)(1); Webb v. City of Phila., 562 F.3d 256, 262 (3d Cir. 2009) (“Before bringing suit \nunder Title VII in federal court, a plaintiff must first file a charge with the EEOC.”).  \nAfter filing a charge with the EEOC, a plaintiff must receive a “right to sue” letter before \nfiling with the district court.  See Burgh v. Borough Council of Borough of Montrose , 251 F.3d 465, \n470 (3d Cir. 2001) (stating the EEOC will then investigate the charge, and the plaintiff must wait until the EEOC issues a right -to-sue letter before she can initiate a private action); Ditzel v. Univ. \n \n4 For sake of clarity, when citing the parties’ briefs and supporting documents, the Court cites to the page number \nlisted in the ECF header.  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 7 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>8 \n of Med. & Dentistry of N.J., 962 F. Supp. 595, 602 (D.N.J. 1997).  This requirement is necessary \n“to put the EEOC on notice of the claims,” affording “it the opportunity to settle disputes” to  avoid \n“unnecessary action in court.”  Webb , 562 F.3d at 262.  “If a plaintiff brings suit under Title VII . . \n. before receiving a ‘right -to-sue letter,’ the matter may be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.”  Small v. Rahway Bd. of Educ., No. 17-1963, 2017 WL 1351400, at *2 (D.N.J. April 6, 2017) (citations omitted).   \nHere, the Amended Complaint contains no allegations that Plaintiff exhausted her \nadministrative remedies, nor does Plaintiff provide any such representations in opposition to the motions to dismiss.  Accordingly, dismissal of the Title VII claims is warranted.  Burg v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Health and Human Servs., 387 F. App’x 237, 241 n.6 (3d Cir. 2010) (recognizing that failure to exhaust may be raised, in appropriate circumstances, on a motion to dismiss).  Because Title VII does not provide for individual liability, the Court dismisses with prejudice all claims within Counts One and Five against the Individual Defendants .\n5  If Plaintiff fails to amend this Complaint \nto include allegations that she has exhausted all administrative remedies prior to filing her Title VII claims, the remaining Title VII claims at Counts One and Five will be dismissed with prejudice.  \nB. Plaintiff Fails to Plead a NJLAD Retaliation Claim (Count Two) \nElectrifAi and the Individual Defendants contend that Plaintiff has not established a prima \nfacie  case of retaliation under NJLAD because she has failed to plead facts that she engaged in a \nprotected activity.  (ElectrifAi Br. at 18 -20; Scott Br. at 1).  In opposition, Plaintiff argues she has \nsatisfied this burden through allegations that she had reported Scott’s August 25, 2022 email to \n \n5 The Court finds the Title VII claims must be dismissed against the Individual Defendants because Title VII does not \nsubject individual supervisory employees to liability.  See Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. ¸ 100 F.3d 1061, \n1078 (3d Cir. 1996) (“Congress did not intend to hold individual employees liable under Title VII.”); Newsome v. \nAdmin. Off. of the Cts. of the State of N.J. , 51 F. App’x 76, 79 n.1 (3d Cir. 2002) (“It is settled that Title VII does not \nprovide for individual liability.”); Emerson v. Thiel Coll. , 296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 2002) (“[I]ndividual employees \nare not liable under Title VII”).   Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 8 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>9 \n Human Resources “under the belief this email was harassment.”  (Opp’n to ElectrifAi at 8).6  As \nPlaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege that she engaged in a protected employee activity, the \nCourt will dismiss the NJLAD retaliation claim.  \nThe NJLAD prohibits an employer from taking any retaliatory action against an employee \nwho engages in a protected activity.  N.J. Stat. Ann. § 10:5- 12(d).  To state a prima facie  case for \nretaliation under NJLAD, an employee must demonstrate: “(1) the employee engaged in a protected employee activity; (2) the employer took an adverse employment action after or contemporaneous with the employee’s protected activity; and (3) a causa l link exists between the \nemployee’s protected activity and the employer’s adverse action.”  Abramson v. William Paterson Coll. of N.J., 260 F.3d 265, 286 (3d Cir. 2001).\n7  “An NJLAD retaliation claim can only succeed \nwhere the plaintiff shows that he or she faced reprisal for opposing conduct that the NJLAD prohibits, including discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.”  \nSharp v. Kean Univ., 153 F. Supp. 3d 669, 676 (D.N.J. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n“To engage in protected activity, the employee must identify what illegal employment \npractice is being opposed, by either implicitly or explicitly alleging that a protected characteristic was the basis for the adverse employment action.”  Phillip v. Starbucks Corp., 624 F. Supp. 3d \n \n6 As the Court discussed supra , Plaintiff’s Title VII claims fail due to her failure to exhaust administrative remedies \nprior to raising these claims.  Notwithstanding, because the analyses for Title VII and NJLAD claims are the same, \nthe Court’s analysis also applies to her retaliator y discharge claim brought under Title VII.  See Cortes v. Univ. of \nMed. & Dentistry of N.J. , 391 F. Supp. 2d 298, 311 (D.N.J. 2005) (explaining “[t]he analysis which is applied in Title \nVII claims is equally applicable to actions brought under other civil rights statutes, and thus the Title VII analysis applies to claims brought under the NJLAD as well.” (internal citation omitted); see also Hargrave v. Cnty. of Atl. , \n262 F. Supp. 2d 393, 410 (D.N.J. 2003) (“As a general matter, the same basic principles apply when evaluating [a] \n[p]laintiff’s claims under [Title VII and the NJLAD].”).  Accordingly, the Court finds, for the reasons set forth below, \nthat Plaintiff’s Title VII retaliatory discharge claim fails even if she had exhausted all administrative remedies prior \nto filing her claim.   \n7 Some courts explicitly include a fourth element in analyzing whether a plaintiff has stated a claim for retaliation in \nviolation of the NJLAD —i.e., that plaintiffs show they are in a protected class.  See, e.g. , Berdzik v. Physicians \nEndoscopy, LLC , No. 20 -11656, 2021 WL 3260857, at *7 (D.N.J. July 30, 2021); Victor v. State , 4 A.3d 126, 141 \n(N.J. 2010).  Other courts do not explicitly include this fourth element in their analysis. See, e.g. , Abramson, 260 F.3d \nat 286 (articulating three elements for a prima facie case of retaliation under Title VII and the NJLAD); Woods -Pirozzi \nv. Nabisco Foods , 675 A.2d 684, 695 (N.J. 1996) (same).  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 9 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>10 \n 530, 546- 47 (D.N.J. 2022) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “‘A general complaint of unfair \ntreatment,’ however, ‘is insufficient to establish protected activity’ under Title VII and the \nNJLAD.”  Id. at 547 (quoting Curay -Cramer v. Ursuline Acad. of Wilmington, Del., Inc., 450 F.3d \n130, 135 (3d Cir. 2006)).  “The ‘complaint[ ] must be specific enough to notify management of the particular type of discrimination at issue in order to constitute protected activity.”’  Id. (alteration \nin original) (quoting Sanchez v. SunGard Availability Servs. LP , 362 F. App’x 283, 288 (3d Cir. \n2010)).  \nHere, the Court finds Plaintiff failed to plead a retaliation claim in violation of the NJLAD \nbecause her reporting of Scott’s email does not constitute a protected activity.  Plaintiff alleges she complained to Human Resources that the email was harassmen t.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 114, 145).  \nHowever, Plaintiff never alleges she believed the email to be harassment as a result of any NJLAD -\nprotected characteristic.   \nNot every complaint, however, is considered a protected activity under the NJLAD.  \nOgunbayo v. Hertz Corp., 542 F. App’x 105, 107 (3d Cir. 2013).  In Ogunbayo, the court found the plaintiff’s complaints were not a protected activity because “she never mentioned any NJLAD -\nprotected characteristics in her letters, let alone attempted to connect the alleged mistreatment to any such characteristic.”  Id.  Instead, the court found it was merely a “‘general complaint of unfair \ntreatment’” that does not amount to a charge of illegal discrimination.  Id. (quoting Barber v. CSX \nDistribution Servs., 68 F.3d 694, 701- 02 (3d Cir. 1995)).  Similarly, here, Plaintiff’s email to Scott \ncomplains about his views of her work performance but does not allege discrimination based on a NJLAD category (i.e., race, gender, religion, etc.).  ( See ECF No. 27- 3).   \nMoreover, although Plaintiff described Scott’s email as “harassment” in the Amended \nComplaint, the use of this word alone is insufficient to convert her conversation with Human Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 10 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>11 \n Resources about the email into a form of “protected activity.”  Ogunbayo, 542 F. App’x at 107 n.2; \nsee also Kelly v. Howard I. Shapiro & Assocs. Consulting Eng’rs, P .C., 716 F.3d 10, 17 (2d Cir. 2013) (“Although particular words such as ‘discrimination’ are certainly not required to put an employer on notice of a protected complaint, neither are they sufficient to do so if nothing in the substance of the complaint sugges ts that the complained -of activity is, in fact, unlawfully \ndiscriminatory.”).   \nAdditionally, Plaintiff’s allegation that the Individual Defendants violated NJLAD as \n“aiders and abettors of Plaintiff’s retaliation” similarly fails.  (Am. Compl. ¶ 149).  As stated above, \nPlaintiff fails to allege a retaliatory discharge claim under NJLAD.  Therefore, “because Plaintiff’s underlying causes of action fail, there can be no claim for aiding and abetting in violation of the NJLAD.”  Haddix v. Camden Cnty. Youth Det. Ctr., No. 13- 1594, 2015 WL 3755023, at *6 (D.N.J. \nJune 16, 2015) (citing Ivan v. Cnty. of Middlesex , 595 F. Supp. 2d 425, 463 (D.N.J. 2009)); accord \nMonaco v. Am. Gen. Assur. Co., 359 F.3d 296, 307 n.15 (3d Cir. 2004) (holding that, because plaintiff's underlying NJLAD claim fails, “any claim he brought against the individual defendants for aiding and abetting fails as well.”).  Accordingly, the Court dismisses Count Two without prejudice.  \nC. Plaintiff Fails to Plead a Pierce Retaliation Claim (Count Three) \nElectrifAi and the Individual Defendants next seek dismissal of Plaintiff’s Pierce claim \nbecause it seeks to vindicate rights already protected under NJLAD and CEPA and fails to adequately plead sufficient facts to establish a wrongful discharge claim.  ElectrifAi Br. at 21 -26; \nScott Br. at 1.  In opposition, Plaintiff argues the Pierce claim is not precluded by her NJLAD and CEPA claims and adequately sets forth adequate factual allegations.  Opp’n to ElectrifAi at 9; Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 11 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>12 \n Opp’n to Scott at 9- 10.  As Plaintiff fails to allege any public policy that Defendants purportedly \nviolated, the Court will dismiss her Pierce claim.  \nIn Pierce, the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that “an employee has a cause of action \nfor wrongful discharge when the discharge is contrary to a clear mandate of public policy.”  Id. at \n512.  “To establish a case for common law wrongful discharge, the employee must identify the \nclear mandate of public policy and that the discharge itself was in violation of that public policy.”  Myers v. Advanced Stores Co., No. 19- 18183, 2020 WL 2744632, at *6 (D.N.J. May 27, 2020) \n(citing Tartaglia v. UBS PaineWebber Inc. , 961 A.2d 1167, 1183 (N.J. 2008)).   \nCritically, “more is needed than simply the breach of public policy affecting a single \nperson’s rights to constitute the breach of a ‘clear mandate’ of public policy that Pierce requires.”  Hennessey v. Coastal Eagle Point Oil Co., 609 A.2d 11, 19- 20 (N.J. 1992).  A plaintiff must “prove \nnot only that he or she complained about [an employer’s] policy, but that his or her resulting discharge violated a clear mandate of public policy.”  Tartaglia, 961 A.2d at 1184.  As such, “[i]f \nan employee does not point to a clear expression of public policy, the court can grant a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment.”  Pierce , 417 A.2d at 513. \nAs a threshold matter, there is no individual liability for a Pierce claim.  See Metzler v. Am. \nTransp. Grp., L.L.C., No. 07- 2066, 2008 WL 413311, at *5 (D.N.J. Feb. 13, 2008) (“A plaintiff is \nonly able to maintain a Pierce cause of action against his or her employer —not against individual \nemployees.”) (citing O’Lane v. N.J. Dep’t of Corr., 712 A.2d 1177, 1180 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1998)).  Accordingly, the Pierce  wrongful discharge claim against the Individual Defendants is \ndismissed with prejudice.  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 12 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>13 \n  As for ElectrifAi and White Oak, Plaintiff does not allege any public policy – let alone one \nthat is clearly mandated – which  was purportedly violated.  As such, Plaintiff’s Pierce claim fails \nand Count Three will therefore be dismissed without prejudice as to ElectrifAi and White Oak .  \nD. Plaintiff Fails to Plead a CEPA Violation (Count Four) \nElectrifAi and the Individual Defendants next argue the CEPA claim should be dismissed \nbecause Plaintiff fails to allege facts showing that she reasonably believed ElectrifAi violated any \nlaw, rule, regulation, or public policy, that she engaged in whistle -blowing activity, or that the \nIndividual Defendants retaliated against her.  (ElectrifAi Br. at 24- 26; Scott Br. at 1, 3- 4).  In \nopposition, Plaintiff argues she has alleged “an obvious CEPA claim here.”  (Opp’n to ElectrifAi at 9-10; Opp’n to Scott at 9- 10).  As Plaintiff has failed to identify – and the Court cannot discern \n– any law, rule, regulation, or public policy that Defendants allegedly violated, the Court will \ndismiss Plaintiff’s CEPA claim with respect to all Defendants.  \nCEPA “creates a cause of action for an employee who is subjected to retaliation for \nreporting workplace misconduct.”  Battaglia v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 70 A.3d 602, 624 (N.J. \n2013) (citing Dzwonar v. McDevitt , 828 A.2d 893, 900 (N.J. 2003)).  The Supreme Court of New \nJersey has emphasized that “CEPA is a remedial statute that ‘promotes a strong public policy of the State’ and ‘therefore should be construed liberally to effectuate its important social goal.’”  Id. \n(quoting Abbamont v. Piscataway Twp. Bd. of Educ., 650 A.2d 958, 971 (N.J. 1994)).  As relevant here, CEPA prohibits employers from taking “any retaliatory action against an \nemployee because the employee does any of the following:” \na. Discloses, or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, \npolicy or practice of the employer, or another employer, with whom there is a business relationship, that the employee reasonably believes: \n Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 13 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>14 \n (1) is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to \nlaw, including any violation involving deception of, or misrepresentation to, any . . . employee . . . of the employer . . .; or  \n \n(2) is fraudulent or criminal, including any activity, policy or practice of deception or misrepresentation which the employee reasonably believes may defraud any . . . employee . . . of the employer  . . .  \n c. Objects to, or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes:  \n \n(1) is in violation of a law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law, including any violation involving deception of, or misrepresentation to, any . . . employee . . . of the employer . . .; or  \n \n(2) is fraudulent or criminal, including any activity, policy or practice of \ndeception or misrepresentation which the employee reasonably believes may defraud any . . . employee . . . of the employer . . .; or  \n (3) is incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare or protection of the environment. \n N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19- 3(a), (c).  \nTo state a claim for a violation of CEPA, the plaintiff has the burden to establish that:  \n“(1) he or she reasonably believed that his or her employer’s conduct violat[ed] either a law, rule, or regulation promulgated pursuant to law, or a clear mandate of public policy; (2) he or she performed a ‘whistle -blowing’ activity described in \nN.J.S.A. 34:19- 3(c); (3) an adverse employment action was taken against him or \nher; and (4) a causal connection exists between the whistle- blowing activity and the \nadverse emp loyment action.”  \nChiofalo v. State , 213 A.3d 900, 908 (N.J. 2019) (quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 900); Lindenberg \nv. Arrayit Corp., No. 14- 833, 2016 WL 659724, at *3 (D.N.J. Feb. 18, 2016) (citing Blackburn v. \nUnited Parcel Serv., Inc., 179 F.3d 81, 92 (3d Cir. 1999)) (applying the same test to N.J.S.A. 34:19-\n3(a)).   The first prong of a CEPA claim contains an “identification requirement.”  Chiofalo, 213 \nA.3d at 909.  With respect to claims brought pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19- 3(a)(1) and (c)(1), \n“either ‘the court or the plaintiff’ must identify the statute, regulation, rule, or public policy that Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 14 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>15 \n closely relates to the complained -of conduct.”  Id. (quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901).  A plaintiff \n“need not show that his or her employer or another employee actually violated the law or a clear \nmandate of public policy,” as “[t]he goal of CEPA . . . is ‘not to make lawyers out of conscientious employees.’”  Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901 (quoting Mehlman v. Mobil Oil Corp., 707 A.2d 1000, \n1015- 16 (N.J. 1998)).  Nevertheless, a plaintiff must “set forth facts that would support an \nobjectively reasonable belief  that a violation has occurred.”  Id.  at 901.  “[T]he trial court must \n[then] make a threshold determination that there is a substantial nexus between the complained- of \nconduct and [the] law or public policy [that the plaintiff or the court] identified.”  Id.  “‘[W]hen no \nsuch law or policy is forthcoming,’ judgment can and should be entered for the defendant.”  Chiofalo, 213 A.3d at 909 (quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901).   \n A similar requirement applies to claims brought under N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19- 3(a)(2) and \n(c)(2), which focus on “fraudulent or criminal” activities.  In Chiofalo, the court recognized that no previous decision had “mention[ed] any . . . obligation to identify some legal source rendering \nactivity fraudulent.”  Id. at 910.  “‘[C]riminal’ or ‘fraudulent’ activity,” the court explained, “is \noften apparent and commonly recognizable,” which “distinguishes claims [under Sections (a)(2) and (c)(2)] from CEPA’s re ferences in sections (c)(1) and (3) to violations of a more general ‘law, \nor a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law’ or of ‘a clear mandate of public policy.’”  Id.   \nNevertheless, the court concluded that “the better practice in CEPA actions brought under (c)(2)[ ] or . . . (a)(2)[ ] surely is to identify the statutory or other basis for claiming objected- to behavior \nis criminal or fraudulent.”  Id.  Although the court does “not expect whistleblower employees to \nbe lawyers on the spot[,] once engaged in the legal process, and with the assistance of counsel or careful examination by the court, . . . the legal underpinnings for claimed behavior that is perceived as criminal or fraudulent should be able to be teased out sufficiently f or identification purposes.”  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 15 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>16 \n Id. at 910.  In that regard, the court cautioned “that trial courts ‘must be alert to the sufficiency of \nthe factual evidence’”— allegations in this stage —“‘and to whether the acts complained of could \nsupport the finding that the complaining employee’s belief w as a reasonable one.’”  Id. at 910 \n(quoting Battaglia , 70 A.3d at 626).  Even where the relevant conduct appears to be criminal or \nfraudulent on its face, “if a defendant questions the source of law relied on by the plaintiff, that \nsource should be provided by the plaintiff.”  Id.  at 910- 11. \n Here, because Plaintiff appears to raise claims under Sections (a)(1) and (c)(1) , and (a)(2) \nand (c)(2), the Court will address each pair of provisions separately.  With respect to each set of provisions, Plaintiff has failed to satisfy the first element of a CEPA claim – namely, her reasonable \nbelief that Defendants’ actions violated a law or public policy, or that they were criminal or fraudulent.  \n Plaintiff’s claim pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19- 3(a)(1) and (c)(1) fails because she has \nnot “identif[ied] [any] statute, regulation, [or] rule . . . that closely relates to the complained- of \nconduct.”  Chiofalo, 213 A.3d at 908.  Even after Defendants raised this objection in their moving papers, Plaintiff still did not identify in her opposition any “law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law,” that she believed Defendants’ conduct to have violate d.  N.J. Stat. Ann. § 34:19-\n3(a)(1), (c)(1).  Plaintiff vaguely alleges that she attempted to report conduct “she reasonably believed constituted improper harassment, threatening behavior, or other discriminatory conduct in violation of relevant laws, rule[s], regulations, and public policies related thereto.”  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 165, 167).  Yet, Plaintiff has not identified any statute or rule “‘that closely relates to’” such conduct.  Chiofalo, 213 A.3d at 909 (quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901).  Further, other than a \ntangential connection to com mon law fraud, which is discussed below, the Court is unable to \nidentify any “law, or a rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to law,” which Plaintiff reasonably Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 16 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>17 \n could have believed Defendants violated in these circumstances. Chiofalo, 213 A.3d at 909 \n(quoting Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 901).  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s claim under Sections (a)(1) and \n(c)(1) is dismissed without prejudice.   \n Plaintiff’s claim pursuant to Sections (a)(2) and (c)(2), which rests on allegedly fraudulent \nconduct,8 similarly fails to satisfy CEPA’s identification requirement.  Although Chiofalo  \nrecognized that no prior case had imposed an identification requirement under Sections (a)(2) and (c)(2), the court concluded that, “once engaged in the legal process, and with the assistance of counsel or careful examination by the court, . . . the legal  underpinnings for claimed behavior that \nis perceived as . . . fraudulent should be able to be teased out sufficiently for identification purposes.”  Id. at 910.  Here, Plaintiff has engaged counsel, filed a Complaint and Amended \nComplaint, and responded to Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss.  Yet, despite Defendants’ argument in their moving papers that Plaintiff had failed to identify any specific law or poli cy that she \nbelieved Defendants had violated, Plaintiff does not refer to any statutory or common law,  or rule \nor policy, in her opposition papers.  See id. at 910 -11 (noting that “if a defendant questions the \nsource of law relied on by the plaintiff, that source should be provided by the plaintiff”).  \n Further, although the Court can identify common law fraud as conceivably relevant to \nPlaintiff’s claim, ( see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 33- 88), Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged a reasonable belief \nthat Defendants committed fraud.  Plaintiff need not establish that Defendants “actually violated the law,” and ultimately a jury “must determine whether the plaintiff actually h eld such a belief \nand . . . whether [it was] . . . reasonable.”  Dzwonar , 828 A.2d at 902.  However, Plaintiff “must \nset forth facts that would support an objectively reasonable belief that a violation has occurred,” such “that there is a substantial nexus between the complained -of conduct” and the law at issue.”  \n \n8 Neither the Amended Complaint nor  Plaintiff’s opposition papers refer explicitly –  or allude –  to conduct that could \nqualify as “criminal” under Sections (a)(2) and (c)(2).  Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 17 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>29 \n Individual Defendants made “false statements regarding Plaintiff’s employment at their company, \nthe terms of her termination, or Plaintiff’s qualifications for future employment” to prospective new employers and “various federal or state agencies.”  (Am. C ompl. ¶¶ 225, 122- 23, 125; see \nalso Am. Compl. ¶¶ 122- 23, 125).  Even accepting all of Plaintiff’s allegations as true, Plaintiff’s \ngeneral allegations of “false statements” made to third parties is insufficient to support a claim of \ndefamation without additional facts.  See Russomanno v. Sunovion Pharms., Inc., No. 22-5032, 2023 WL 2649453, at *3 (D.N.J. Mar. 27, 2023) (dismissing defamation claim alleging the defendant “spoke about [the] [p]laintiff to potential employers in a ‘disparaging way’” as insufficient without additional facts); Veteran Relocation Project, LLC v. Borough of Bradley Beach , No. 22- 1817, 2022 WL 16822116, at *5 (D.N.J. Nov. 8, 2022) (dismissing defamation \ncomplaint alleging defendants “hurled abuse” at plaintiffs during a meeting for  failure to plead \nsufficient facts); Foy v. Wakefern Food Corp., No. 09- 1683, 2010 WL 147925, at *6 (D.N.J. Jan. \n7, 2010) (dismissing defamation claim for providing no information “beyond mere conclusory statements” and failing to plead facts sufficient to “identify the defamatory words, their utterer[,] and the fact of their publication”).  The Amended Complaint fails to allege with enough specificity: (1) that any of the Defendants made false and defamatory statements concerning her; and (2) fault that am ounts to negligence.  Since Plaintiff’s allegations are not sufficient to demonstrate a \nplausible claim for relief, the Court dismisses Count Nine without prejudice.    \nI. Plaintiff Fails to Plead a Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith \nand Fair Dealing Claim (Count Ten)  \n \nElectrifAi and the Individual Defendants further argue that the Court should dismiss the \nimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim because there is no contract between Plaintiff and Defendants .  Further, even if the Court were to find the Amended Complaint alleges a contract, \nthere are insufficient facts to suggest they acted in bad faith with a bad motive.  (ElectrifAi Br. at Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 29 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>30 \n 37-38; Scott Br. at 4).  Plaintiff argues the Amended Complaint adequately alleges an implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing claim based on her offer letter and “numerous allegations \nreflecting Defendant’s bad faith acts.”  (Opp’n to ElectrifAi at  11-12).  As Plaintiff has failed to \nadequately allege the existence of a contractual relationship between Defendants and herself, the Court will dismiss the breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim.  \nIn New Jersey, contracting parties are “bound by a duty of good faith and fair dealing in \nboth the performance and enforcement of the contract.”  Brunswick Hills Racquet Club, Inc. v. Route 18 Shopping Ctr. Assocs., 864 A.2d 387, 395 (N.J. 2005).  While the concept of good faith is difficult to define in precise terms, “[g]ood faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party[.]”  Wilson v. Am erada Hess Corp., 773 A.2d 1121, 1126 (N.J. 2001) \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  To allege such a claim, a plaintiff must assert: (1) a contract exists between the parties; (2) the plaintiff performed under the terms of the contract; (3) the \ndefendant acted in bad f aith with the purpose of depriving the plaintiff of rights or benefits under \nthe contract; and (4) the defendant’s actions caused the plaintiff to sustain damages.  TBI Unlimited, LLC v. Clear Cut Lawn Decisions, LLC , No. 12- 3355, 2014 WL 3853900, at *3 (D.N.J. \nAug. 5, 2014) (citing Wade v. Kessler. Inst., 778 A.2d 580, 586 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2001), aff’d as modified, 798 A.2d 1251 (N.J. 2002)).  \nAs such, a claim based on a “[b]reach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \nis not a free -standing cause of action; such a covenant is an implied covenant of a contract .”  \nLuongo v.

Ct. \nApp. Div. 1990) (“In the absence of a contract, there can be no breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”); see also Varrallo v. Hammond Inc., 94 F.3d 842, 848 (3d Cir. 1996). \nHere, Plaintiff alleges she “was contracted to work at ElectrifAi as an executive sales \nrepresentative and was to be eligible for a commission in addition to her salary if certain performance standards were met.”  (Am. Compl. ¶ 234).  However, this does not constitute an \nallegation of the existence of an express or implied contract.  Additionally, Plaintiff’s reliance on the offer letter is similarly unavailing.  ( See Opp’n to ElectrifAi at 11 -12).  The offer letter \nexpressly states it “does not create or i mply any contract of employment, and [Plaintiff’s] \nemployment with the Company will at all times be on an ‘at -will’ basis.”  (ECF No. 27- 1 at ¶ 8).   \nIndeed, a breach of the implied covenant cannot occur in the absence of a contractual \nagreement.  See Schlichtig v. Inacom Corp., 271 F. Supp. 2d 597, 606- 07 (D.N.J. 2003) (“[B]ecause \nthe Court has concluded that the terms of this employee manual could not have given rise to an implied contract of employment, it necessarily follows that the manual’s provisions do not contain an imp lied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”); Barone v.

As Plaintiff fails to \nallege the existence of a contract between Defendants and h erself, her implied covenant of good \nfaith and fair dealing claim fails.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses Count Ten without prejudice.   \nJ. Plaintiff Fails to Plead Any Plausible Claims Against White Oak  \nFinally, White Oak also seeks dismissal of the claims asserted against it because there are \nno factual allegations that it participated in the complained -of conduct.

Plaintiff disputes this contention and argues she has set forth sufficient factual allegations to \nestablish White Oak could be liable as Plaintiff’s employer or the employer of the Individual Defendants.  (Opp’n to White Oak at 9).  As Plaintiff fails to set forth sufficient allegations regarding White O ak’s par ticipation in the alleged misconduct, the Court dismisses the claims \nagainst White Oak.   \nAs White Oak points out, the sole allegation in the Amended Complaint concerning it is: \n   Upon information and belief, Defendants White Oak Financial, LLC and White Oak Global Advisors, LLC (both entities referred to herein as “White Oak”) are limited liability companies formed under the laws of Delaware who owned ElectrifAi, appointed several members to ElectrifAi’s Board, and otherwise exerted control and/or oversight over ElectrifAi’s operations throughout the duration of Plaintiff’s Employment.   \n \n(Am. Compl. ¶ 11). \n Although the Court has already dismissed each Count of Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint \nbased on various pleading deficiencies, the Court agrees, as a general matter, that the Amended Complaint is devoid of any factual allegations suggesting that White Oak wa s itself responsible \nfor the purportedly unlawful conduct allegedly engaged by its subsidiary, ElectrifAi.  See generally Pearson v. Component Technology Corp., 247 F.3d 471, 484 (3d Cir. 2001) (“[M]ere ownership of a subsidiary does not justify the imposition of liability on the parent.”); Marzano v. Computer Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 32 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>33 \n Science Corp. Inc., 91 F.3d 497, 513 (3d Cir. 1996); see also United States v. Bestfoods , 524 U.S. \n51, 61 (1998) (“It is a general principle of corporate law deeply ‘ingrained in our economic and \nlegal systems’ that a parent corporation . . . is not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries.”).  Thus, to the extent Plaintiff chooses to amend any claims and to reassert any such claims against White Oak, the complaint must be amended to include facts that would allow the Court to draw the reasonable inference that White Oak is liable for the misconduct alleged.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, Defendants’ Motions to Dismiss (ECF Nos. 32- 34) are \nGRANTED, and the Amended Complaint (ECF No. 27) is DISMISSED without prejudice , \nexcept for Counts One, Three , and Five, which are DISMISSED with prejudice as to the \nIndividual Defendants only . \nAn appropriate Order accompanies this Opinion.   \n \n             \nDATED:  9/13/2024     JULIEN XA VIER NEALS  \n United States District Judge  \n Case 2:23-cv-02239-JXN-JRA     Document 67     Filed 09/13/24     Page 33 of 33 PageID:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves Michael Muir, who is challenging the use of Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) scanners by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) due to their impact on individuals with disabilities like his own, a congenital birth defect that presents as a hernia. Muir claims that the Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) software in these scanners wrongly identifies his condition as a threat, resulting in painful and invasive pat-downs. The court partially grants Muir’s petition, remanding it to the TSA to further consider accommodations under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 but denies all other aspects of his petition.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the TSA's use of AIT scanners violates the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by failing to provide reasonable accommodations for passengers with disabilities.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court grants Muir's petition in part, requiring the TSA to evaluate whether implementing Muir's requested accommodation would impose an undue burden on the agency under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, while denying the petition in all other respects.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Michael Muir has a medical condition that makes airport security scanners, which find hidden objects, think he is hiding something dangerous. This means he has to undergo painful extra checks. He took TSA to court to ask for different screening procedures for people like him with medical conditions. The court agreed that the TSA should rethink whether it can give Muir and others like him a more comfortable security check without too much trouble for the agency.",

Muir contends that  his hernia causes him to \nexperience various problems ranging from severe pain to \npotentially life-threatening partial strangulation of his \nintestines.  Muir filed a peti tion challenging the Transportation \nSecurity Administration’s (TSA) Final Rule, which authorized its use of scanners  that use electroma gnetic radiation—known \nas Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) scanners—to screen airline passengers at airport s ecurity screening checkpoints.  \nSee Passenger Screening Using Advanced Imaging \nTechnology, 81 Fed. Reg. 11,364, 11,365 (Mar. 3, 2016).   \n TSA posits that “AIT is th e most effective technology \ncurrently available to detect both metallic and non-metallic \nthreat items concealed on passengers.”  Id.  However, for Muir, \nAIT scanners equipped with Automatic Target Recognition \n(ATR) software inevitably flag his hernia as a threat object, which requires TSA agents to perform pain-inducing and potentially life-threatening pa t-downs of his groin area.  \nAccordingly, Muir implores us to  hold that the Final Rule and \nTSA’s standard operating proced ures (SOPs) are arbitrary and \ncapricious, contrary to TSA’s st atutory authority, and violate \nprotections afforded under Sec tion 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.   USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 2 of 263 \n We grant Muir’s petition in pa rt and remand the matter to \nTSA for further proceedings to determine whether implementation of Muir’s requested accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act will impose an undue burden on the agency.\n1  We deny the petition in all other respects.             \n  \nI.  \nA. \nThe terrorist attacks of Se ptember 11, 2001, significantly \naltered airport secu rity measures.  S oon afterward, Congress \nestablished TSA, see Aviation and Trans portation Security \nAct, Pub. L. No. 107–71, 115 Stat. 597 (Nov. 19, 2001), and made it responsible “for the sc reening of all passengers and \nproperty” boarding passenger airplanes, 49 U.S.C. § 44901(a), and developing regulations prohibiting airlines from \ntransporting passengers who refuse to consent to the screening, \nid. § 44902(a)(1).  As a result, Congress charged TSA with \nensuring that passengers did not  board a commercial airline \nflight carrying dangerous weapons , explosives, or destructive \nsubstances.  Id. §§ 44901(a), 44902(a)(1).   \nThree years later, Congress enacted the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Preven tion Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. \n108–458, 118 Stat. 3638 (Dec. 17, 2004) , and directed TSA to \ndevelop “a strategic plan to  promote . . . deployment of \nexplosive detection equipment at airports to screen individuals \nand their personal property . . . includ[ing] walk-through \nexplosive detection portals, doc ument scanners, shoe scanners, \nand backscatter x-ray scanners .”  49 U.S.C. § 44925(b)(1).  \nAnd after a spate of attemp ted terror attacks involving \n \n1 Our colleague dissents only insofar as he would hold that we lack \njurisdiction to consider Muir’s request for an accommodation pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act.   USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 3 of 264 \n nonmetallic explosives, Congr ess further directed the \nDepartment of Homeland Securi ty (DHS), the Cabinet-level \ndepartment overseeing TSA, to  “give a high priority to \ndeveloping, testing, improvi ng, and deploying” a new \ntechnology at airport screeni ng checkpoints “that detects \nnonmetallic, chemical, biological , and radiological weapons, \nand explosives.”  Id. § 44925(a).  TSA responded to these \ndirectives by prescribing the deta ils of the screen ing process in \na set of SOPs2 and by barring any pe rson from entering the \n“sterile area”3 of an airport “or board[ing] an aircraft without \nsubmitting to the screening and in spection of his or her person \n. . . in accordance with the procedures being applied to control access to that area or aircraft .”  49 C.F.R. § 1540.107(a).   \nIn 2007, TSA initially deployed AIT scanners as \nsecondary screening measures, but by 2010 AIT scanners were the primary method of screening.  “AIT creates an image of the \nfull body that highlights objects that are on the body.”  J.A. 196.  TSA deploys AIT scanners that use “non-ionizing radio \nfrequency energy in the millimeter wave spectrum to generate an image based on the energy reflected from the body,” J.A. \n197, and “detect metallic and no n-metallic objects on an \nindividual’s body or concealed in  his clothing without physical \ncontact,” 81 Fed. Reg. at 11,365.  An example of the image generated by millimeter wave AIT appears below: \n \n2 “TSA’s SOPs are internal documents that contain instructions for \n[Transportation Security Officers (TSOs)] on how to operate \nequipment and conduct screening.  TSOs receive extensive training to perform screening as described in  the SOPs.  These documents are \n[Sensitive Security Information] and cannot be shared with the \npublic.”  81 Fed. Reg. at 11,386. \n3 “Sterile area” is defined as the area of an airport “that provides \npassengers access to boarding aircraft and to which the access \ngenerally is controlled by TSA . . . through the screening of persons \nand property.”  49 C.F.R. § 1540.5. USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 4 of 265 \n  \nJ.A. 198.  \n“If an anomaly is detected [during the scan of a passenger], \na pat-down of the area where the anomaly is located is usually \nperformed to determine if a threat  is present.”  81 Fed. Reg. at \n11,365.  “A pat-down may include inspection of the head, neck, arms, torso, legs, and feet[,]” as  well as “sensitive areas such \nas breasts, groin, and the buttocks.”  Security Screening , TSA, \nhttps://www.tsa.gov/travel/secur ity-screening (last visited \nMar. 5, 2025) (“Pat-Down Screening” drop-down box).  TSA provides limited screening accommodations for those with \ndisabilities and medical conditi ons, but the agency emphasizes \nthat persons with such conditions  must also “undergo screening \nat the checkpoint.”  Disabilities and Medical Conditions , TSA, \nhttps://www.tsa.gov/travel/tsa-car es/disabilities-and-medical-\nconditions (last visited Mar. 5, 2025).  However, also, once an \nindividual has begun the screeni ng process, with or without \naccommodation, he or she must complete it.  81 Fed. Reg. at 11,382.  “Individuals are not allowed to leave partway through.”  Ramsingh v. TSA , 40 F.4th 625, 629 (D.C. Cir. \n2022).   \nB. \nOn July 15, 2011, in response to  an earlier legal challenge \n USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 5 of 266 \n asserting that TSA failed to enga ge in rulemaking regarding the \ndecision to use AIT for primar y screening, we remanded the \nmatter for TSA “to conduct a notice-and-comment rulemaking.”  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. DHS , 653 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. \nCir. 2011).  As TSA explained in the preamble to its resultant \nproposed Rule, by that time Congress had responded to privacy concerns about AIT scanner-generated passenger images in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Public Law 112-\n95, which imposed a further requirement on TSA   \nto ensure that all AIT used to screen passengers must \nbe equipped with and em ploy automatic target \nrecognition (ATR) software.  49 U.S.C. § 44901(l).  That software eliminates passenger-specific ( i.e., \nindividual) images and instead indicates the  location of potential threats on a ge neric outline.  Since May \n2013, all AIT units deployed by TSA have been equipped with ATR capability.   \n81 Fed. Reg. at 11,365.  The following is an image from an AIT \nscanner using ATR:   \n \nJ.A. 199. \nAs required by this Court, TSA issued a Notice of Public \n USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 6 of 267 \n Proposed Rulemaking regarding AIT on March 26, 2013.  \nPassenger Screening Using Advanced Imaging Technology, 78 Fed. Reg. 18,287 (Mar. 26, 2013).  The proposal was designed \nto “codif[y] the use of AIT to sc reen individuals at aviation \nsecurity screening checkpoints,” id. at 18,289, and account for \nthe additional requirement to use ATR.  The Final Rule regarding AIT screening with ATR was promulgated on March \n3, 2016.\n4  81 Fed. Reg. 11,364. \nC. \n Muir asserts that he is “a qualified individual with a \ndisability under 42 U.S.C. § 12102 because” of his hernia.  J.A. \n109 ¶ 2.  Muir claims that he is “symptomat ic every day for at \nleast some part of the day.”  J.A. 110 ¶ 3.  Moreover, there is no way for him to tell when this partial intestinal incarceration is life-threatening.  \nOn August 9, 2018, Muir allege s that he attempted to \nboard a flight departing from Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport \nwhile symptomatic.  The AIT scanner identified a potential threat object located at Muir’s right groin.  As a result, a TSA \nagent allegedly performed a physic al pat-down of Muir’s right \ngroin area despite his protestati ons causing him extreme mental \nand physical pain and suffering.  Three days later, on August 12, 2018, Muir allegedly experi enced the same hardship \nboarding a flight leaving Gene ral Wayne A. Downing Peoria \nInternational Airport.         \nAfter his experiences in August 2018, Muir sent TSA a \nproposal on November 1, 2019, requesting an informal discussion pursuant to 28 C.F. R. § 14.6 about his security \n \n4 We use “AIT scanners” or “AIT scanning” hereafter as a shorthand \nfor AIT scanners equipped with ATR software.   USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 7 of 268 \n screening issues, which TSA subsequently denied on \nNovember 19, 2019.  Muir then filed a complain t with DHS’s \nOffice for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) on \nDecember 15, 2019, alleging disc rimination based on his \ndisability.  On January 7, 2020, CRCL closed Muir’s complaint \nand took no action.    \n On December 1, 2022, while standing in the security \nscreening line at St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport, Muir contends that he realized that his hernia was not reducible—meaning he could not return the displaced tissue to its normal position—before passi ng through the AIT scanner.  \nAlyssa Pastorino & Amal A. Alshuqayfi, Strangulated Hernia , \nNat’l Libr. of Med., https://perma.cc/3HLU-28RN  (last \nupdated Dec. 19, 2022).  Faced with having to endure another \npainful pat-down, Muir did not board his flight.  \nApproximately two weeks later, he filed pro se a petition for \nreview on December 14, 2022, asking us to set aside the Final Rule as unlawful.\n5  Thereafter, we appointed amicus curiae to \npresent arguments on behalf of Muir.6   \n \nII.  \n \nWe have jurisdiction over Muir’s petition.  49 U.S.C.          \n§ 46110.  In reviewing a peti tion under § 46110, we uphold the \nagency’s decision unless it is “‘arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,’ or unsupported by ‘substantial evidence.’”  Suburban Air Freight, \nInc. v. TSA , 716 F.3d 679, 681 (D.C. Ci r. 2013) (first quoting \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(a); and then  quoting 49 U.S.C. § 46110(c)).  \n \n5 Muir named both DHS and TSA in his petition.  DHS is no longer \na party to this action after we dismissed all claims against it for lack \nof standing.    \n6 We express our gratitude to William Weaver, Haley Tuchman, and \nMichelle Li for their service.

We will uphol d the agency’s determination \nif it “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its  action includi ng a ‘rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U .S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co. , 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington \nTruck Lines, Inc. v. United States , 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \n \nIII.  \n \nMuir, aided by appointed amicus, challenges the Final \nRule and TSA’s SOPs on several gr ounds.  First, Muir contends \nthat TSA’s use of AIT scanne rs with ATR technology does not \ncomport with statutory requireme nts and is therefore contrary \nto law.  Second, amicus asserts that TSA’s failure to respond to \ncomments raising concerns with the use of AIT scanners on travelers with disabilities rende rs the Final Rule arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Third, amicus also claims that TSA’s failure to provide alternative screening pr ocedures for passengers with \ninternal disabilities is arbitrar y and capricious.  Finally, Muir \nand amicus argue that the Final Rule and TSA’s SOPs, as applied to Muir, violate Secti on 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973.   \n Before analyzing any of thos e issues, we address Muir’s \npending motion to supplement the administrative record with \nadditional documentation from a prior action in the United States District Court for the Di strict of Arizona.  We deny this \nmotion as the supplemental info rmation is unnecessary to our \ndecision.  As to his other clai ms, we conclude that Muir’s \nRehabilitation Act claim succeeds,  but all other challenges are \neither forfeited or meritless. USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 9 of 2610 \n    \nA. \n    \nBefore we consider the merits  of his petition, Muir must \novercome an administrative exhaus tion requirement.  Under     \n§ 46110(d), we have jurisdiction to “consider an objection to \nan order of the [TSA] . . . only if the objection was made in the proceeding conducted by [TSA].”  49 U.S.C.  § 46110(d).  This provision requires a pe titioner to raise a rulemaking challenge \nor point to where another party raised “the same objection[],” \nduring the notice-and-comment process.  Vaughn v. FAA , 756 \nF. App’x 8, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citing § 46110(d)).  Thus, we \nin turn may only review those arguments the administrative agency had the opportunity to cons ider in the first instance.  \nAdvocs. for Highway & Auto Safety v. Fed. Motor Carrier Safety Admin. , 429 F.3d 1136, 1150 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“[A] \nparty will normally forfeit an opportunity to challenge an \nagency rulemaking on a ground that  was not first presented to \nthe agency for its initial consideration.”); Omnipoint Corp. v. \nFCC , 78 F.3d 620, 635 (D.C. Cir. 1996)  (“As a general rule, \nclaims not presented to the agency may not be made for the first time to a revi ewing court.”).   \n \n1. \n First, Muir contends that TS A did not have the statutory \nauthority to promulgate the Fina l Rule.  He complains that the \nFinal Rule eliminated “the millimeter wave scanner[’s] . . . ‘visual image’” requirement in contradi ction of 49 U.S.C.          \n§ 44901(l).  Pet’r Br. 13.  He next protests that it improvidently \nreplaced “human image operator agents with a narrow artificial intelligence algorithm as the final decision-maker regarding potential anomalies present in passenger screening data.”  Id.  \nAs to the former, Muir assert s that “Congress require[d] that \nthe millimeter wave scanner de vice [used in the screening of USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 10 of 2611 \n passengers] create a visual ima ge and the TSA removed the \ncapability of the device to create a visual image.”  Id. at 23.  As \nto the latter, Muir argues that “there is nothing in § 44901(l) to \nsuggest that the TSA need[ed] to replace the human image operator TSO with a narrow artifi cial intelligence algorithm to \nanalyze scanned data.”  Id.   \n TSA asserts that Muir forfeited those statutory challenges \nto the Final Rule by failing to either raise them during the public rulemaking proceedings or  provide a reasonable ground \nfor not making the objections.  Muir responds that because other parties articulated the very same objections he raises in their public comments to TSA, our  exercise of jurisdiction is \nproper under 49 U.S.C. § 46110(d).  Amicus further suggests \nthat it was reasonable for a person with Muir’s  disability to not \nmonitor the Federal Register  for notices of proposed \nrulemakings with the potential to affect him.   \n Here, TSA did not have an opportunity to consider Muir’s \nstatutory arguments during rulema king.  It is undisputed that \nMuir failed to personally raise the challenges, but his specific claims were also not preserved by other public comments during the notice and comment period.  While some public \ncomments addressed technologi cal issues, no commenter \nraised the very objections that Muir has presented to us.  Therefore, Muir forfeited his st atutory challenges to the Final \nRule.  \n2. \n \nNext, court-appointed amicus asserts that TSA failed to \naddress publicly raised concerns  “that (1) medically disabled \nindividuals are at a higher risk of triggering false positives by \nthe AIT scanner, and (2) the subs equent pat-down is simply not \nsafe for many of those travelers, because they can experience USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 11 of 2612 \n severe pain or potentially fatal health complications.”  Amicus \nReply Br. 4.  Amicus furthe r contends that while TSA \naddressed medical issues generally, the agency failed to either respond to comments or consid er procedures for airline \npassengers whose medical conditions cause consistent AIT alerts resulting in pat-downs.  In this regard, amicus contends, \nTSA’s failure to address the comments concerning disabled \npassengers supports the conclusi on that the Final Rule was \narbitrary and capricious.     \n Here, again, there is no di spute regarding whether Muir \nraised this two-part disabl ed passenger objection during \nrulemaking, because he did not.  However, while some commenters did reference the profiling of the medically \ndisabled, see, e.g. , J.A. 153, J.A. 160, J. A. 176, and others \ncomplained about the risks associated with pat-downs, see J.A. \n147, J.A. 149, J.A. 151, none addres sed the distinct burdens on \ndisabled persons who are simult aneously affected by both.  \nThus, TSA had no obligation to respond to Muir’s specific \ncircumstance when no comment raised anything materially \nanalogous to bring the issue to its attention.  Cf. Unemployment \nComp. Comm’n of Alaska v. Aragon , 329 U.S. 143, 155 (1946) \n(“A reviewing court usurps the ag ency’s function when it sets \naside the administrative de termination upon a ground not \ntheretofore presented and deprives the Commission of an opportunity to consider the matter, make its ruling, and state the reasons for its action.”).  We therefore hold that court-\nappointed amicus’ first challenge to the Final Rule  is forfeited \nbecause no party raised the ob jection during the notice-and-\ncomment period.               \nB. \n \nCourt-appointed amicus  also challenges the Final Rule \nbecause it does not provide altern ative screening procedures for USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 12 of 2613 \n travelers with internal physical disabilities, even though TSA \nroutinely uses such alternat ives for other categories of \npassengers—like PreCheck®7 passengers, passengers carrying \nan infant, child, or a small pet, passengers accompanied by service animals, and at airports th at lack AIT scanners.  Amicus \nargues that because TSA uses th e combination of walk-through \nmetal detectors (WTMDs) and e xplosive trace detection swab \ntests as alternatives for these travelers, it is arbitrary and \ncapricious to deny requests for alternative screening \nprocedures for passengers with internal physical disabilities.          \n TSA responds to amicus’ arguments by pointing out that \nalternative screening measures  are used for TSA PreCheck® \npassengers, children, and the elderly because TSA pre-determined them to be low-risk travelers.  Moreover, alternative screening measures are available to passengers for \nwhom AIT screeners cannot successfully produce an image, because they cannot raise their arms as required, must remain \nconnected to medical equipment,  or must remain accompanied \nby service animals and pets.  TS A further explained that the \ndifference between Muir and thes e passengers lies in the fact \nthat the latter have external ch aracteristics that are immediately \napparent to TSOs and do not crea te verification or proof issues \nthat would be impracticable to administer at security checkpoints nationwide.     \n In its explanation, TSA ra tionally connected the facts \nbefore it to its decision to offer alternative screening procedures for two categories of  passengers—(1) those deemed \na lower security risk base d on background checks or other \n \n7 “TSA PreCheck® is an exped ited screening program that makes \nrisk assessments about passengers prio r to their arrival at an airport \ncheckpoint.”  TSA PreCheck® , TSA, https://www.tsa.gov/news/pres \ns/factsheets/tsa-precheck   (last visited June 16, 2025) USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 13 of 2614 \n available intelligence; and (2) those whose images AIT \nscanners cannot succ essfully capture—wh ile declining to \nprovide a similar process fo r passengers with internal \ndisabilities like Muir’s.  Unlik e the first group, passengers with \ninternal disabilities, like Muir, have not been determined, as a \nclass, to present a lower security risk.  See J.A. 40.  And unlike \nthe second group, passenge rs with internal disabilities going \nthrough AIT scanners, do not impede the scanners’ ability to function to produce images  of those passengers.  See J.A. 60.  \nUnder 49 U.S.C. § 46110’s deferential standard of review, that is enough to establish that TSA’s decision to exclude \nalternative screening methods in  the Final Rule for travelers \nwith internal physical disabi lities is not arbitrary and \ncapricious.  Accordingly, we deny court-appointed amicus’ \nsecond challenge to the Final Rule.  As TSA noted, Muir’s challenge is more “properly pres ented and resolved in a claim \nunder the Rehabilitation Act,” Re sp’t Br. 28, to which we now \nturn.   \n  \nC. \n \nFinally, we consider Muir’s claim that the Final Rule and \nTSA’s SOPs, as applied to him,  violate the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 701–797.  The Rehabilitation Act “empower[s] individuals with disabilities to maximize \nemployment, economic self-suf ficiency, independence, and \ninclusion and integrat ion into society.”  Id. § 701(b)(1).  The \nAct’s “basic tenet is that the Government must take reasonable affirmative steps to accomm odate the handicapped, except \nwhere undue hardship would result.”  Barth v. Gelb , 2 F.3d \n1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1993).   \n Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits \ndiscrimination against disabled pe rsons by recipients of federal \nfunds.  29 U.S.C. § 794.  We star t by addressing two threshold USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 14 of 2615 \n issues.  First, Muir’s Rehabilitation Act claim is properly \nbefore us because we, not the district courts, have exclusive jurisdiction under § 46110(a) to  review claims that TSA \n“orders” are “not in accordance with law.”  Suburban Air \nFreight , 716 F.3d at 681.  A TSA SOP is such an “order,” \nRoberts v. Napolitano , 798 F. Supp. 2d 7, 10 (D.D.C. 2011), \naff’d , 463 F. App’x 4, 4–5 (D.C. Cir. 2012), which Muir asserts \nis not in accordance with the Rehabilitation Act.  Muir challenges the SOP, as applied to him, that instructs TSOs to conduct follow-up pat-downs of body parts flagged by AIT \nscanners, a practice that, wit hout appropriate accommodation, \nallegedly excludes Muir from participation in TSA’s security screening.  Pet’r Br. 44. \n Our dissenting colleague take s the position that we lack \njurisdiction because Muir did not specify any SOP in his \npetition for review.  He asserts that Muir has accordingly failed \nto satisfy the requirements of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to “specify the order . . . to be reviewed” in the petition.  F\nED. R. APP. P. 15(a)(2)(C); see Partial Dissent at 1–\n2.  We disagree.  It is true that Muir, a pro se litigant, did not identify the relevant (nonpublic ) SOP in his petition, but only \ndesignated the Final Rule that authorizes it.  See Pet. for \nReview 1 (J.A. 32).  “But a ‘m istaken or inexact specification \nof the order to be reviewed’ is ‘n ot fatal,’ as long as the ‘intent \nto seek review of a specific order [i] can be fairly inferred from \nthe petition for review or from other contemporaneous filings, and [ii] the respondent is not  misled by the mistake.’”  Am. \nRivers v. FERC , 895 F.3d 32, 44 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting \nEntravision Holdings, LLC v. FCC , 202 F.3d 311, 313 (D.C. \nCir. 2000)) (alterations in orig inal) (emphasis omitted).   \n Those conditions are met here.  Muir’s petition explained \nthat he is not able to proceed  through screening because “the \nconfiguration of the AIT [s canner] . . . algorithmically USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 15 of 2616 \n misidentifies [his] hernia as a threat object requiring a pat-\ndown to resolve.”  Pet. for Revi ew 2 (J.A. 33).  That statement \nsufficed to inform TSA that Muir  challenged its direction to \nsecurity personnel to conduct follow-up pat-downs of any potential threat object identified by an AIT scanner—a direction Muir now knows is spel led out in an SOP.  Notably, \nTSA claims no prejudice from the petition’s failure to specify \nan SOP.  Those circumstances show that the petition meets the requirements of Rule 15(a)(2).  Accordingly, we do not believe either Federal Appellate Rule of Procedure 15(a)(2)(C) or § \n46111(a) preclude our exercise of jurisdicti on over Muir’s \nRehabilitation Act claim.   \n Second, TSA suggests Muir’s challenge is foreclosed \nbecause Muir “did not avail hims elf of the opportunity to bring \nan administrative complaint alleging a violation of Section 504.”  Resp’t Br. 47.  But § 4611 0(d) excuses the failure to \nraise a claim for an accommodation in a proceeding before the agency “if there was a reasona ble ground for not making the” \nrequest.  49 U.S.C. § 46110(d).  As discussed below, Muir’s \nprior attempts at procuring an accommodation through the available administrative process we re exercises in futility that \nexcuse him from engaging in yet another such futile attempt.  \nSee Tesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC , 552 F.3d 868, 874 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (observing that the futility exception to exhaustion is “limited to situations ‘when resort to administrative remedies [would be] “clearly useless.”’”) (citation omitted).  Although our dissenting collea gue is correct \nthat the futility exception is us ed sparingly, Partial Dissent at \n5, we find present the requisite “certainty of an adverse decision,” id. (citation omitted), in TSA’s assertion that Muir’s \nrequested accommodation “woul d fundamentally alter the \nnature of TSA’s security screen ing program,” Resp’t Br. 14.  \nSee also  J.L. v. SSA , 971 F.2d 260, 271 (9th Cir. 1992) \n(“Exhaustion is futile where the agency’s position on an issue USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 16 of 2617 \n ‘appears already set,’ and it is ‘very likely’ what its result \nwould have been.”).  We accordi ngly need not decide in this \ncase whether non-employee petitio ners bringing Section 504 \nclaims ordinarily must firs t exhaust their administrative \nremedies.  Cf. id. at 270 (“[W]e recognize that the \nRehabilitation Act does not requir e exhaustion of remedies in \nall cases.”), rev’d on other grounds , Lane v. Pena , 518 U.S. \n187 (1996).  We thus proceed to co nsider the merits of Muir’s \nRehabilitation Act claim.         \n \n1. \n “To prove a violation of sect ion 504, [complainants] must \nshow that (1) they are disabled within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, (2) they ar e otherwise qualified, (3) they \nwere excluded from, denied th e benefit of, or subject to \ndiscrimination under a program or  activity, and (4) the program \nor activity is carried out by a federal executive agency or with \nfederal funds.”  Am. Council of the Blind v. Paulson , 525 F.3d \n1256, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 2008).  In addition, the disabled individual “bears the ‘initial burden’ of showing that a \nreasonable accommodation is possible” and  “[o]nce that showing is made, an [agency] may still avoid liability by \nshowing that the proposed accommodation would impose an ‘undue hardship’ on the [agency]’s operations.”  Ali v. Regan , \n111 F.4th 1264, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (c itations omitted).      \n TSA does not dispute Muir’s abil ity to satisfy the liability \nelements of a Section 504 claim, that is, he “is an ‘individual \nwith a disability’ as defined in 29 U.S.C. § 705(20), . . . he is \n‘otherwise qualified’ to pres ent to a TSA checkpoint and \nreceive security screening . . . [and] TSA’s security screening \nactivities are a ‘program or  activity conducted by an[] \nExecutive agency’ under 29 U.S.C. § 794(a).”  Resp’t Br. 44.  \nRather, TSA argues that Muir’s  requested accommodation is USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 17 of 26RANDOLPH , Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in part and\ndissenting in part:\nI join the majority opinion except for part III. C.  I dissent\nfrom that part because our court lacks jurisdiction to review\nMuir’s contentions regarding the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 701 et seq.\n \nMuir’s petition for judicial review invoked 49 U.S.C.\n§ 46110(a), a statute conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts\nof appeals—direct review—over a person’s1 “petition for\nreview” of an “order” of the Transportation Security\nAdministration.  The majority opinion declares that the\n§ 46110(a) “orders” establishing our jurisdiction are TSA’s\nStandard Operating Procedures, or “SOPs.”2  The opinion then\nconsiders Muir’s arguments (and those of a court appointed\n“amicus” attorney) regarding the Rehabilitation Act. \nThe majority has missed a step.  It first should have noticed\nthat Muir’s § 46110(a) petition did not designate any TSA\nStandard Operating Procedure as an “order” with respect to\nwhich he sought judicial review.  As a consequence, and as I will\nexplain, our court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate Muir’s claims\nabout the Rehabilitation Act.  \nRule 15(a)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure states: a petition for direct review of an agency\ndecision “must . . . specify the order or part thereof to be\nreviewed.”  Note the “must.”  Muir, although representing\n1 That is, “a person disclosing a substantial interest in an order” of the\nTransportation Security Administration. 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a).\n2 These are non-public directions to staff regarding screening\nprocedures. See Roberts v. Napolitano , 798 F. Supp. 2d 7, 9 (D.D.C.\n2011), aff’d, 463 F. App’x 4 (D.C. Cir. 2012). USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 22 of 262\nhimself, cannot claim ignorance of this rule—he cited Rule 15\nin his petition for judicial review.  To repeat, Muir’s petition\nnever mentioned any SOPs.3\nThe law of our circuit is that a petitioner’s failure to specify\nan “order” in compliance with Rule 15(a)(2)(C) deprives our\ncourt of jurisdiction to review that order.  See City of Benton v.\nNuclear Regul. Comm’n , 136 F.3d 824, 826 (D.C. Cir. 1998)\n(per curiam); John D. Copanos & Sons, Inc. v. FDA , 854 F.2d\n510, 527 (D.C. Cir.1988); Small Bus. in Telecomms.  v. FCC, 251\nF.3d 1015, 1022 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  Our opinion in City of Benton\nadded that the “jurisdictional requirements of Rule 15(a) may\nnot be waived.”  136 F.3d at 826 (citing Gottesman v. INS , 33\nF.3d 383, 388 (4th Cir. 1994)).\n3 Muir’s “contemporaneous filings” also failed to notify the\ngovernment of the order being challenged.  See Small Bus. in\nTelecomm. v. FCC , 251 F.3d 1015, 1019 (D.C. Cir. 2001). Muir filed\nhis petition on December 14, 2022. Fifteen days later, on December\n29, he filed the Docketing Statement, Statement of Issues, and\nUnderlying Decision from which Petition Arises. None of these filings\nmentioned the SOPs. The filings merely reiterated Muir’s objection\nto TSA’s promulgation of 49 C.F.R. § 1540.107(d) and DHS’s order\ncertifying the AIT devices.\nThe majority excuses Muir as a “pro se litigant” unable to\nidentify the “nonpublic” SOPs.  Majority Op. at 15. But Muir knew of\nthe SOPs when he filed his petition in this court in December 2022.\nIn January 2021, the District Court for the Central District of Illinois\ndismissed one of Muir’s suits because “TSA’s screenings are\nconducted pursuant to [the SOP] . . . and challenges to the SOP . . . lie\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals.” Muir v.\nTSA, 2021 WL 231733, at *11 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 22, 2021). Muir then\ndiscussed the SOPs in his Seventh Circuit brief in 2021. See Brief for\nthe Appellant at 13, Muir v. TSA , 857 F. App’x 251 (7th Cir. 2021)\n(No. 21-1312), ECF No. 15. USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 23 of 263\nThe next problem with part III.C of the opinion is this. \nSection 46110(a)—the provision Muir invoked to establish our\njurisdiction—requires a petition for review to be filed within 60\ndays of issuance of the “order.”  Our court has held that\n“simpl[e] ignorance of the order” will not excuse\nnoncompliance.  Matar v. TSA , 910 F.3d 538, 542 (D.C. Cir.\n2018) (quoting Avia Dynamics, Inc. v. FAA , 641 F.3d 515, 521\n(D.C. Cir. 2011)).  It is one thing if a person files his petition\nchallenging an order after the 60-day deadline expired.  Section\n46110(a) has an escape valve for those who have “reasonable\ngrounds” for delay.  The built-in assumption of § 46110(a) is\nthat the person, at some time after the 60 days had run, filed a\npetition for review of the “order.”  Muir was not late in filing. \nThe problem for him—and the majority—is not with delay.  It is\nthat he did not, and still has not, filed any § 46110(a) petition\nobjecting to an SOP.\nThe third jurisdictional defect in the majority’s analysis is\nas follows.  The majority excuses Muir from his failure to\nexhaust administrative remedies because “Muir’s prior attempts\nat procuring an accommodation . . . were exercises in futility.”\nMajority Op. at 16.  What “prior attempts”? The majority has\nonly one “attempt” in mind.  That is the single complaint Muir\nlodged with the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties\non December 15, 2019, three years before the events at the\nFlorida airport described in his petition for judicial review in this\ncase. Majority Op. at 8.  This Office—CRCL—responded to\nMuir’s complaint in a January 2020 letter.  The letter stated that\nafter reviewing the information Muir “provided, CRCL has\nrecorded it in our database.” Muir Reply Br. Addendum at 42. \nCRCL took no further action and Muir considered his complaint\nas having been “denied.” Muir Reply Br. at 17.\nThe DHS regulation governing complaints like Muir’s—6 USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 24 of 264\nC.F.R. § 15.70(d)—requires claims of disability discrimination\nto be filed within 180 days of the discriminatory conduct. \nMuir’s complaint alleged discrimination at two airports in\nAugust 2018.  He did not file  his complaint with CRCL until\nNovember 1, 2019, many months out of time.  \nMore important, CRCL’s letter was not “final agency\naction” subject to judicial review.  See Bennett v. Spear , 520\nU.S. 154, 177–78 (1997); Magassa v. Mayorkas , 52 F.4th 1156,\n1165 (9th Cir. 2022).  It was only an intermediate determination. \nIf Muir was dissatisfied with CRCL’s response, he had a right to\ntake an administrative appeal within 60 days.4  In such an appeal,\nit is “the Officer for Civil Rights  and Civil Liberties, or\ndesignee thereof, who will issue the final agency decision which\nmay include appropriate corrective action to be taken by the\nDepartment.”  6 C.F.R. § 15.70(i) (emphasis added).\nBut Muir never filed an administrative appeal regarding his\nNovember 2019 complaint.  In other words, he did not then\nexhaust his administrative remedies.5  And so the majority\nopinion is clearly mistaken in excusing Muir from having to\npresent any administrative complaint whatsoever before\n4 “Appeals of the findings of fact and conclusions of law or remedies\nmust be filed by the complainant not later than 60 days after receipt\nfrom the Department of the letter” denying the complaint. 6 C.F.R.\n§ 15.70(h).\n5 See, e.g., Smith v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield , 959 F.2d 655, 659 (7th\nCir. 1992) (requiring litigants challenging agency action to “show that\nit is certain that their claim will be denied on [administrative] appeal,\nnot merely that they doubt an appeal will result in a different\ndecision”).  Our court cited this portion of Smith with approval in\nTesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC , 552 F.3d 868, 874 (D.C. Cir.\n2009). USCA Case #22-1318      Document #2127237            Filed: 07/25/2025      Page 25 of 265\npursuing his Rehabilitation Act claim in this court.6  There is no\ntelling how the CRCL Officer would have ruled in 2020 had\nMuir appealed, and still less is there any way to know how he\nwould have been treated if he had filed an administrative\ncomplaint in 2022.  The majority therefore erred in applying the\nfutility exception of exhaustion.  That exception is “quite\nrestricted,” Comm. of Blind Vendors of D.C. v. District of\nColumbia , 28 F.3d 130, 133 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1994), and is\nconfined to situations when resort to administrative remedies\nwould be “‘clearly useless,’” Randolph-Sheppard Vendors of\nAm. v. Weinberger , 795 F.2d 90, 105 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (quoting\nBaxter v. Claytor , 652 F.2d 181, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1981)); see also\nTesoro Refin. & Mktg. Co. v. FERC , 552 F.3d 868, 874 (D.C.\nCir. 2009).\n6 49 U.S.C. § 46110(d) itself required Muir to exhaust his\nadministrative remedies.  That section, and comparable provisions in\nthe judicial review statute of many agencies, cannot be waived.  See\nEEOC v. FLRA , 476 U.S. 19, 23 (1986).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves Mike and Maureena Strong suing Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC, its associated entities, and their legal representatives, alleging wrongful foreclosure actions related to their property. They claimed violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), among others; however, the defendants' motion to dismiss was granted as the plaintiffs’ claims were barred by doctrines such as res judicata, Rooker-Feldman, and Younger abstention. Additionally, the court considered the possibility that the Strongs used generative AI to prepare their legal documents, which resulted in inaccuracies and could lead to sanctions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs, the Strongs, presented viable legal claims against the defendants given their repeated litigation concerning the same property and issues, and whether they violated procedural rules by using potentially AI-generated, fictive legal citations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the Strongs' complaint in its entirety, ruling that the claims were not only unfounded and repetitious but also precluded by previous judgments and procedural doctrines. The court noted suspicions of AI-assisted drafting in the Strongs' filings and warned against using fictitious legal citations.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Mike and Maureena Strong kept filing lawsuits about their house, trying to stop it from being taken away after not paying the mortgage. The judge said they couldn't keep doing this because they had lost previous lawsuits about the same thing and were using made-up citations in their paperwork, possibly because they used AI to write it. The judge asked them to cut it out and said if they keep doing this, there might be penalties.",

STANDARD OF REVIEW  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the text of the \nplaintiff's complaint must contain enough factual allegations to nudge the \nplaintiff's claims \"across the line from conceivable to plausible.\" See Bell \nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) . A plaintiff's claims are \nplausible if the facts alleged allow the Court to reasonably infer that the \ndefendant could be held responsible for the misconduct alleged.  Ashcroft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009) . Whether a plaintiff is represented or pro se , \nthe plaintiff's complaint must allege specific facts sufficient to state a claim. \nSee Martin v. Sargent , 780 F.2d 1334, 1337 (8th Cir. 1985) .  \nThe Court will liberally construe pro se  complaints, and these litigants \nare held to a lesser pleading standard. Topchian v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, \nN.A., 760 F.3d 843, 849 (8th Cir. 2014) . If the essence of an allegation is \ndiscernible, although pleaded without \"legal nicety,\" the Court will construe \nthe complaint in a way that allows the claim to be evaluated within the proper \nlegal framework. Stone v. Harry , 364 F.3d 912, 915 (8th Cir. 2004) . While the \nCourt must accept as true all facts pleaded by the pro se  party, and grant all \nreasonable inferences in their favor, see Gallagher v. City of Clayton , 699 F.3d \n1013, 1016 (8th Cir. 2012) , determining whether a complaint states a plausible \nclaim for relief requires the Court to draw on its judicial experience and \ncommon sense. Iqbal , 556 U.S.  at 679 . \n When deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court is \nnormally limited to considering the facts alleged in the complaint. However, \nthe Court may consider exhibits attached to the complaint and materials that \nare necessarily embraced by the p leadings without converting the motion . \nMattes v. ABC Plastics, Inc. , 323 F.3d 695, 697 n.4 (8th Cir. 2003) . Documents \nnecessarily embraced by the pleadings include those whose contents are 8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 2 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>3 \n alleged in a complaint and whose authenticity no party questions, but which \nare not physically attached to the pleading. Ashanti v. City of Golden Valley , \n666 F.3d 1148, 1151 (8th Cir. 2012) . The Court may also take notice of public \nrecords, such as prior court proceedings. Levy v. Ohl , 477 F.3d 988, 991 (8th \nCir. 2007) .  \nII. BACKGROUND  \n  The following timeline is based on the facts in the Strongs' complaint, \naccepted as true for the purposes of the pending motions to dismiss, and the \nrelevant state and bankruptcy court proceedings. See filing 5 ; Levy , 477 F.3d \nat 991 .  \n \n• January 2021: Rushmore Loan, represented by Shannon and \nSouthlaw, sued the Strongs in state court. See filing 7 -1 at 25 ; case \nno. CI 21 -2476  (Dist. Ct. of Sarpy C nty, Neb.) .  \n• July 2023: The state court entered judgment in favor of Rushmore \nLoan, ordering a judgment lien on the Gretna property. See filing \n7-1 at 26 . The Strongs moved  the state court  to vacate or set aside \nits judgment. See filing 7 -1 at 29 . That motion was promptly \ndenied. Filing 7 -1 at 29 . The Strongs then appealed the judgment \nto the Nebraska Court of Appeals. Filing 7 -1 at 32 ; see case no A -\n24-770 (Neb. Ct. App.).  \n• August 2023: The Strongs filed for bankruptcy, allegedly to \nprevent the imminent judicial foreclosure sale. Filing 5 at 3 ; case \nno. BK 23 -80695  (Bankr . D. Neb.) . In bankruptcy court, the 8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 3 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>4 \n Strongs filed an adversary complaint against Rushmore Loan, \nRushmore Servicing, and U.S. Bank. See case no. BK 23 -8023  \n(Bankr . D. Neb.) . Those defendants were jointly represented by \nShannon and Southlaw. The Strongs sought declaratory judgment \nnullifying the  state court  Order of Sale. The bankruptcy court \ndismissed the adversary complaint with prejudice. See case no. BK \n23-80695  (Bankr . D. Neb.) .  \n• September 2023: Rushmore Loan transferred its interest in the \nGretna property to Rushmore Servicing. Filing 5 at 19 . \n• January 2024: The Nebraska Court of Appeals issued its mandate \ndismissing the Strongs' appeal from the July 2023 summary \njudgment order. See filing 7 -1 at 36 ; see also  Rushmore Loan Mgmt. \nServs. LLC v. Strong , 32 Neb. App. xiii, No . A-23-763 (summarily \ndismissing appeal for lack of jurisdiction).  \n• August 2024: The state court executed an order of sale of the \nGretna property in favor of Rushmore Loan. Filing 5 at 15 -17. The \nStrongs submitted an \"Emergency Motion to Vacate Order of Sale,\" \nwhich was denied. The Strongs appealed, and that appeal is \ncurrently pending. See case no. A -24-877 (Neb. Ct. App.).  \n The Strongs allege that Shannon and Southlaw made false statements \nto the bankruptcy court regarding the relationship between Rushmore Loan \nand Rushmore Servicing, as well as purportedly misrepresenting the Strongs \nas \"serial filers.\" Filing 5 at 6 . They allege a litany of legal theories, including \nstate -law torts like abuse of process and malicious prosecution, and violations 8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 4 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>5 \n of statutes like the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1692  et seq . \nSee filing 5 at 4 -10. \nThe Strongs request compensatory and punitive damages, a declaration \nthat the sheriff's sale was unlawful and void, reversal or annulment of the \nsheriff's sale, and restoration of the Strongs' rights and interest in the Gretna \nproperty. Filing 5 at 10 -11.  \nIII.  DISCUSSION  \n1. MOTION TO JOIN AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT  \nShannon and Southlaw seek to dismiss the claims against them based \non both lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. Filing 7 . The \nRushmore defendants filed a \"ditto\" motion, and expressed that the legal \narguments contained in the other defendants' brief were equally applicable to \nthe claims against Rushmore. See filing 12 . Citing nonexistent cases,1 the \nStrongs assert that joining another party's motion without argumentation is \ninsufficient. See filing 13 at 1 .  \nIt's true that the local rules require that a motion be supported by a brief \nfiled and served together with a motion. NECivR 7.1(a)(1)(A). But a brief is not \nrequired if a motion raises no substantial issue of law and relief is in the \nCourt's discretion. R ule 7.1(a)(1)(B). Here, the motion at issue requests that \nthe Court apply the already -filed motion to dismiss to the Rushmore \ndefendants. All of the defendants are jointly represented. The Court agrees \nwith the Rushmore defendants that duplicative briefing  on the same issues is \nunnecessary. See filing 12 at 1 . The Court will consider the Rushmore \n \n1 The Court suspects that the Strongs utilized generative artificial intelligence in drafting \ntheir pleadings and briefs. This suspicion is discussed more below.  8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 5 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>6 \n defendants under the legal arguments raised in the other defendants' motion \nto dismiss.  \nThe Strongs have also moved for default judgment against Rushmore. \nSee filing 11  (incorrectly filed as \"Administrative Record\") . But the Strongs \nhave failed to comply with the procedural requirements to obtain such a \njudgment: They did not obtain a clerk's entry of default, nor did they submit \nan affidavit stating that the party against whom the default judgment is \nrequested is no t an infant or incompetent person. See NECivR 55.1(a); Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 55 .  \nNor does it seem that the Strongs could obtain the clerk's entry of \ndefault, anyway. While the summons for the allegedly -defaulted defendants \nwas issued on September 25, 2024, the Strongs have not adduced any evidence \nthat service was executed  on that day. On the contrary, Rushmore has provided \nreceipts that it was not served until October 7, 2024. Filing 16 at 3 . Further, \nthere is no way that the Strongs can show prejudice from relying on the \n\"default.\" See Johnson v. Dayton Elec. Mfg. Co. , 140 F.3d 781, 785 (8th Cir. \n1998) . The motion for default judgment ( filing 11 ) is denied.  \n2. STATE COURT JUDGMENT AND SHERIFF 'S SALE \nThe Strongs request that this Court \"vacate and set aside\" a state court \norder issuing a sheriff's sale of the Gretna property. Filing 5 at 6 . That order \nis currently under appeal. See case no. A -24-877 (Neb. Ct. App.). The Strongs \nfurther request that this Court restore the Strongs' interest in the Gretna \nproperty , apparently asking this Court to undo the state court's judgment in \nfavor of the Rushmore defendants . Filing 5 at 10 . But despite the Strongs' 8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 6 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>7 \n assertions about jurisdiction,2 there are a number of issues with litigation in \nfederal court intended to \"nullify\"  a state court order.  \nTo start, a federal court lacks jurisdiction over \"cases brought by state -\ncourt losers complaining of injuries caused by state -court judgments rendered \nbefore the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court \nreview and rejection of thos e judgments.\" Shelby Cty. Health Care Corp. v. S. \nFarm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co. , 855 F.3d 836, 840 (8th Cir. 2017)  (the Rooker -\nFeldman doctrine); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1257 . And a federal court must abstain \nwhen there is a parallel criminal prosecution, or particular state civil \nproceedings akin to a criminal prosecution, ongoing in a state court. See Sprint \nComm., Inc. v. Jacobs , 571 U.S. 69, 72 -73 (2013)  (Younger abstention). This \nwould include civil enforcement proceedings, where a judgment creditor seeks \nto execute its rights. See id. ; Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc. , 481 U.S. 1, 17 (1987) .  \nOf course, just because a federal plaintiff raises the same or similar \nissues as decided in a state court proceeding does not mean dismissal or \nabstention  are warranted . See Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp. , \n544 U.S. 280, 293 (2005) ; Sprint Comm. , 571 U.S. at 77 . Federal courts are \nobligated to exercise their jurisdiction  . . . if they have it. A party that presents \nan independent  claim, even one contrary to a state court's order, is able to \npursue that claim in federal court.  \n But the Strongs don't present an independent claim regarding the \nallegedly \"wrongful\" sheriff's sale —the alleged damages, and the requested \nrelief, flow directly from the state court's order. The Strongs contend that they \ndo not \"directly\" challenge the s tate court's rulings. See filing 8 at 3 . But that's \n \n2 The tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is \ninapplicable to legal conclusions. Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 .  8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 7 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>8 \n just nonsense, and contradictory to the relief they request. See filing 5 at 6 . \nMoreover, that order is currently under appeal, based on alleged problems with \nstanding that the Strongs presented to the state court. See filing 7 -1 at 41 . This \nCourt cannot interfere with the state court's civil enforcement proceedings \nuntil they are fully resolved. See Pennzoil Co. , 481 U.S. at 17 .3 And to the \nextent the Strongs ask this Court to undo the Sarpy County District Court's \nJuly 2023 judgment, that claim is barred by Rooker -Feldman .  \n Notwithstanding Rooker -Feldman and Younger , the Strongs argue that \nthe defendants perpetrated a fraud on the foreclosure court, violating federal \ncriminal law. See filing 5 at 5 ; 18 U.S.C. § 152 . But an alleged violation of a \ncriminal law does not create a private cause of action. See Oglala Sioux Tribe \nv. Schwarting , 894 F. Supp. 2d 1195, 1200 (D. Neb. 2012)  (collecting cases) . \nAnd the Eighth Circuit has not recognized a fraud -on-the-court exception to \nRooker -Feldman . Fielder v. Cr. Acceptance Corp. , 188 F.3d 1031, 1035 -36 (8th \nCir. 1999) . The Court cannot take any action related to the state court's orders.   \n The Strongs also advanced the same claims, regarding the defendants' \nlack of standing and other deficiencies in the summary judgment order, to the \nbankruptcy court in an adversary proceeding . In the adversary proceeding, the \nStrongs sought declaratory judgment voiding the sheriff's sale and the state \ncourt's order. See case no. BK 23 -8023  (Bankr . D. Neb.) . The bankruptcy court \ndismissed the claims with prejudice. This dismissal implicates the doctrine of \nres judicata .  \n The bankruptcy court was a federal proceeding, so federal principles of \nres judicata apply. Cf. Brown v. Kansas City Live, LLC , 931 F.3d 712, 714 (8th \n \n3 And even once those proceedings resolve, any attack would be collateral; this Court has no \nauthority to undo a state court judgment under these circumstances.  8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 8 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>9 \n Cir. 2019) . A plaintiff is  precluded from relitigating any claims already \npursued, or which might have been pursued in the earlier proceeding. Lane v. \nPeterson , 899 F.2d 737, 742 (8th Cir. 1990) . The Court is barred from hearing \nclaims if: (1) a prior judgment was rendered by a court of competent \njurisdiction, (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits, and (3) \nthe same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were inv olved in \nboth cases. Id. \n All of the elements are met here. The bankruptcy court judgment came \nfrom a competent court, and the judgment was on the merits. And the \nRushmore defendants were parties to the adversary complaint. Res judicata \ndoes not preclude the Strongs from pursuing claims against Shannon and \nSouthlaw —but the facts alleged related to those defendants  appear to seek \ndamages for alleged misleading statements made during the bankruptcy \nproceedings, and those allegations cannot support the requested relief to \nvacate or un do the state court order s. Res judicata  precludes this Court's \nreview of alleged deficiencies in the state court judgment.   \n Based on Younger abstention and the doctrines of Rooker -Feldman  and \nres judicata , the Strongs are unable to pursue the claims intended to undo the \nstate court's orders.  \n3. OTHER CLAIMS  \n(a) FDCPA  \nThe Strongs assert that the defendants violated federal law by refusing \nto release a lien in response to a written request to do so. See filing 5 at 7 . They \nadditionally argue that the defendants misrepresented the relationship \nbetween the Rushmore defendants in bankruptcy court and in state  court in \norder to collect the debt.  8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 9 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>10 \n  The FDCPA generally prohibits debt collectors from using \"any false, \ndeceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the \ncollection of any debt.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1692e ; Demarais v. Gurstel Chargo, P.A. , \n869 F.3d 685, 694 (8th Cir. 2017) . But the Eighth Circuit has not addressed \nwhether foreclosure activities constitute debt collection under the FDCPA, and \nat least one court in this circuit has determined it does not. See Gray v. Four \nOak Court Ass'n, Inc. , 580 F. Supp. 2d 883, 887 (D. Minn. 2008) . There's a legal \ndistinction between a \"debt\" and a security interest like a mortgage or a lien, \nand the FDCPA may not apply to the latter. See id.    \nEven if the FDCPA did apply, there's no basis to infer that the \ndefendants violated the statute when they ignored a baseless letter from the \nStrongs requesting that the lien be released. The Court is further unpersuaded \nthat the defendants' alleged representation that Mike Str ong is a \"serial filer\" \nwas false. While considering a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept the \nplaintiff's allegations as true. But the Court may take judicial notice of other \nlawsuits. This Court previously referred to Strong as a vexatious litigant. See \nStrong v. Caliber Home Loans, Inc. , No. 8:17-cv-485, 2018 WL 3321438, at *1 \n(D. Neb. July 5, 2018) . Based on common sense and prior proceedings,  see \nIqbal , 556 U.S.  at 679 , the defendants' alleged statement was not false or \nmisleading.  \nAnd the fact that Shannon and Southlaw referred to the Rushmore \ndefendants' interest as harmonized during the foreclosure and bankruptcy \nproceeding cannot be characterized as misleading. As the defendants point out, \nunder Nebraska law, \"[i]n the case of an y . . . transfer of interest, the action \nmay be continued in the name of the original party.\" Filing 7 -1 at 17  n.1 (citing \nNeb. Rev. Stat. § 25 -322). There is no basis to infer that the defendants made \nfalse or misleading statements regarding the relationship between Rushmore 8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 10 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>11 \n Loan and Rushmore Servicing. Rushmore Loan initiated the foreclosure action, \nand Nebraska law enables that  original party to continue the  lawsuit , even  \nafter a subsequent transfer of interest.  \n The Strongs seek to benefit from legal technicalities they simply don't \nunderstand. The FDCPA was intended to prevent abusive, deceptive, and \nunfair practices by debt collectors. § 1692. The Strongs' allegations fall far \nshort of alleging any such practice, even drawing all inferences in their favor \nand liberally construing their complaint. A lawyer is obligated to zealously \nrepresent her client, and there's no indication that Shannon did anything but.  \nThe Strongs have failed to state a claim under the FDCPA.  \n(b) State Law Torts  \nNor do the purported false or misleading statements state a claim for \nrelief under any other tort under Nebraska law. The Strongs pled a variety of \nlegal doctrines, citing inapplicable Nebraska statutes and cases. See generally \nfiling 5 . But it is the facts alleged, not the legal theories offered, which state a \nclaim for relief. The Court has liberally construed the Strongs' complaint and \nhas considered if any cause of action exists based on the facts alleged. The \nStrongs have failed to allege even an inference of wrongdoing on the part of \nany of the defendants.  \nSpecifically, the Strongs pled a number of \"counts\" which don't reflect \nactual causes of action. These include: Count I, Wrongful Sheriff's Sale; Count \nII, Promoting Wrongful Sheriff's Sale and Misrepresenting Plaintiff as a Serial \nFiler; Count III, Failur e to Release Lien; Count IV, Dereliction of Duty; and \nCount V, Damages for Credit and Reputation. See filing 5 at 4 -9. But none of \nthese are actually independent causes of action. Some of the \"counts\" contain 8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 11 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>12 \n facts which might be considered as malicious prosecution or abuse of process, \nseparately listed as \"Count VI\" and \"Count VII.\"  \n But the facts alleged support neither a malicious prosecution nor an \nabuse of process claim. An essential element of malicious prosecution is that \nthe proceedings must have terminated in the plaintiff's favor. McKinney v. \nOkoye, 842 N.W.2d 581, 591 (Neb. 2014) . The Strongs cannot make such a \nshowing here —they have lost every lawsuit in which the present defendants \nhave been involved.  Abuse of process is not a particularly well -developed tort \nunder Nebraska law. See Gordon v. Comm. First St. Bank , 587 N.W.2d 343, \n351 (Neb. 1998) . But at a minimum, it requires a plaintiff to establish two \nelements: \"the existence of an ulterior purpose and an act in the use of the \nprocess not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceeding.\" Id. The \nStrongs have not identified any ulterior motives or irregular process, or any \nfacts that support even an inference of this element of their abuse of process \nclaim.  \n\"Dereliction of duty\" might be construed as a claim for malpractice, or \nbreach of a fiduciary duty. But the facts alleged appear to refer to Southlaw's \nfailure to properly train or oversee Shannon, and are presented as a theory of \nwhy Southlaw should be le gally responsible for Shannon's actions. It's a theory \nof liability, but is not a standalone legal theory to afford  relief.  \nNor can any of the facts alleged support a claim for malpractice or breach \nof a fiduciary duty. There's no indication that Shannon or Southlaw breached \nany duty, fiduciary or otherwise, owed to an adverse party in a foreclosure \naction. See Sickler v. Kirby , 805 N.W.2d 675, 691 (Neb. 2011)  (starting point \nfor determining an attorney's duty to a third party is whether the third party \nwas an intended beneficiary of an attorney's service); Miller v. Farmers and 8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 12 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>13 \n Merchants Bank , No. A -15-459, 2016 WL 2978594, at *4 ( Neb.  Ct. App. May \n17, 2016)  (no fiduciary relationship between a mortgagor and mortgagee).  \nFinally, there's no basis to infer that the defendants did anything wrong \nwhen they ignored the Strong's request to release the lien. The defendants are \nfree to exercise their legal rights granted by the judgment in their favor, which \nincludes legal action  related to the judgment lien. The Strongs have failed to \nstate a claim regarding the alleged \"failure to release the lien\" or the alleged \nfailure to respond to the Strongs' letter regarding the lien.  \n4. UNSUPPORTED CLAIMS  \nTo support their lacking legal theories, the Strongs cited to several cases \nthe Court is unable to find. Strangely, while the case names the Strongs cite \nexist, the actual citation is completely different. For example, the Strongs cite \nUnited States v. Bortnovsky , 820 F.3d 572 (2d Cir. 2016) , filing 13 at 1 , but the \nappropriate case citation for that case name is (presumably) 683 F. Supp. 449 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1988) , and the citation provided directs to United States v. \nTagliaferri , 820 F.3d 568 (2d. Cir. 2016) . And neither case supports the \nStrongs' purported legal proposition. While once might be a mistake, the \nStrongs' briefing has several similar errors (mismatched case names and \ncitations irrelevant to the legal proposition purported).  \nThe Court is highly suspicious that the Strongs utilized generative \nartificial intelligence in drafting their complaint and briefs , which is known to \nresult in the sort of fictional or \"hallucinatory\" citations the Strongs provide. \nSee, e.g., Mata v. Avianca, Inc. , 678 F. Supp. 3d 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2023) . The \nStrongs should take notice of the fact that such conduct, if repeated, could \nsubject them to sanctions, even as pro se  litigants. See Rubio v. D.C. , No. 23 -\ncv-719, 2024 WL 4957373, at *4 (D.D.C. Dec. 3, 2024) ; Vargas v. Salazar , No. 8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 13 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>14 \n 4:23-CV-4267, 2024 WL 4804091, at *3 (S.D. Tex. Nov. 1, 2024) ; Martin v. \nHawai'i , No. 24 -cv-294, 2024 WL 3877013, at *2 (D. Haw. Aug. 20, 2024) . Even \npro se  litigants are bound by Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b) , see Carman v. Treat , 7 F.3d \n1379, 1382 (8th Cir. 1993) , and citing imaginary  law violates that rule, see Park \nv. Kim , 91 F.4th 610, 615 (2d Cir. 2024) .  \nAnd even if the Strongs' cited cases or statutes existed, or said what they \nare purported to say, the Strongs cannot survive the defendants' motion to \ndismiss. The Strongs are not permitted to shop around the same set of facts to \ndifferent courts or judges  in the hopes of getting a different answer. And there \nare no facts that support even an inference of wrongdoing on the part of the \ndefendants. The present lawsuit is just another attempt to delay the inevitable \nlegal outcome: removing the Strongs from the ir Gretna property. None of the \nStrongs' arguments indicate that they are entitled to remain in a home for \nwhich they have not paid.  \nIV. SANCTIONS  \nIt's clear the Strongs are uninterested in ceasing their malicious and \nvexatious litigation. The defendants have requested that this Court sanction \nthe Strongs to prevent them from filing more meritless lawsuits.4 A district \ncourt is vested with discretion to impose sanctions upon a party under its \ninherent disciplinary power. Bass v. Gen. Motors Corp. ¸150 F.3d 842, 851 (8th \nCir. 1998). But there is a strong policy against depriving a party of his day in \n \n4 That said, it's unclear to the Court how, exactly, the Strongs are still residing in the Gretna \nproperty. See filing 7 -1 at 2 . The defendants represented that the lender purchased the \nproperty at a judicial foreclosure sale. See filing 7 -1 at 11 . It's unclear if the defendants have \nattempted to remove the Strongs from the property. Sanctions are likely unwarranted if these \nor future defendants fail to demonstrate sufficient efforts to exercise their rights.  8:24-cv-00352-JMG-JMD     Doc # 24     Filed: 01/15/25     Page 14 of 16 - Page ID #\n<pageID>15 \n court. Id. A party's affinity for litigation, standing alone, does not provide a \nsufficient reason for filing restrictions. Ruderer v. U.S. , 462 F.2d 897, 899 (8th \nCir. 1972) . \nThat said, if a court determines that a party is acting in bad faith, or if a \nparty has already been afforded a full opportunity to present his claims and \nfurther suits on these claims would uselessly consume the Court's time, filing \nrestrictions may be ap propriate. See id. ; Chambers v. NASCO, Inc. , 501 U.S. \n32, 43 (1991) . Such restrictions must be narrowly tailored to afford a party the \nright to access the courts. See Bass , 150 F.3d at 851 ; Van Deelen v. City of \nKansas City , 262 Fed. App'x 723, 724 (8th Cir. 2007) .  \nAt this point  . . . the Court will not impose filing restrictions on the \nStrongs. However, if they continue to pursue claims with the intent to delay, \nhinder, or harass those attempting to exercise their legal rights with regard to \nthe Gretna property, this Court will strongly consider both monetary sanctions \nand narrowly -tailored filing restrictions. See Chambers , 501 U.S. at 45 .  \n Accordingly,  \n \nIT IS ORDERED:  \n1. Shannon and Southlaw's motion to dismiss and for sanctions \n(filing 7 ) is granted in part.  \n2. Rushmore Loan and Rushmore Servicing's motion to join the \nmotion to dismiss ( filing 12 ) is granted.  \n3.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Jae Lee, a New York attorney, filed a lawsuit against Delta Air Lines, alleging racial discrimination involving a seat dispute on a flight. The court, after reviewing procedural history and evidence, granted Delta's motion for summary judgment, dismissing claims under federal and New York law, including an asserted claim under § 1981, with prejudice. The case does mention a concern that some of the Plaintiff's legal references were generated by AI (ChatGPT), leading to hallucinations or non-existent case citations, but the claim itself did not involve AI or automated systems in its central facts or issues.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Plaintiff could amend her complaint after the deadline and whether her allegations of racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 against Delta Air Lines held merit to avoid summary judgment.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court overruled the Plaintiff's objections to the magistrate’s report and recommendation, adopted the report in full, and granted Delta's motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint was denied, and the § 1981 claim was dismissed, as was the entire case, for being moot due to a lack of remaining claims.\n\n4. **ELI5**: Imagine you make a complaint that someone treated you unfairly at work based on your race, but you don't share enough detail when you explain it to the judge. When you try to change your complaint later, after the deadline, the judge says it's too late to change, and even if your story was detailed enough, the other person gave a good reason for their action. So, your case gets dismissed because it doesn't strongly hold up. Also, the judge gets worried because some of the laws you talked about in your story seem to come from a make-believe source, like someone wrote them using a story-making robot and confused real with fake.",

KUNTZ, II, United States District Judge: MEMORANDUM & ORDER \n20-CV-0 1705 (WFK) (LGD) \nOn April 6, 2020, Jae Lee (\"Plaintiff'), a practicing New York attorney proceedingpro se, filed \na complaint against Delta Air Lines, Inc. (\"Delta\"), John Doe, 1 and Jane Doe (collectively, \n\"Defendants\"), alleging Delta employees racially discriminated against her on a Delta flight in \nviolation of federal and New York law. ECF No. 1. On August 29, 2022, following discovery \nand with Delta's summary judgment motion pending, Plaintiff filed a motion to amend her \nComplaint. ECF No. 58.2 The Court referred Plaintiffs motion to amend the Complaint to \nMagistrate Judge Lee G. Dunst for a Report and Recommendation (\"R&R\"), which Judge Dunst \nissued on March 14, 2023. ECF No. 72. Plaintiff timely filed objections to the R&R on March \n28, 2023. ECF No. 73. For the following reasons, the Court OVERRULES Plaintiffs \nobjections, and ADOPTS the R&R. Furthermore, after considering the parties' fully briefed \nsummary judgment arguments, the Court GRANTS Defendant Delta's motion for summary \njudgment, ECF No. 55, as to Plaintiffs purportedly asserted claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 \nagainst all Defendants. With no remaining causes of action, Plaintiffs Complaint is \nDISMISSED as moot. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close the case. \nREPORT & RECOMMENDATION \nI. BACKGROUND \nThe R&R provides a comprehensive description of the facts of this case and therefore the \nCourt will not recite them at length. See R&R at 2-4. The relevant procedural developments are \nas follows. \n1 Plaintiff misspelled John Doe as \"JONE\" Doe in the caption of the Complaint. See Complaint, ECF No. 1. \nPlaintiff correctly refers to \"John Doe\" in the body of the Complaint, id, which the Court uses as well. \n2 After the Court's referral, Magistrate Judge Lee G. Dunst set a new briefing schedule and ruled Plaintiffs initial \nmotion seeking leave to amend the Complaint, ECF No. 58, as moot. Pursuant to the briefing schedule, Plaintiff \nfiled on October 7, 2022 a new motion seeking the same relief to amend the Complaint, ECF No. 70, to which the \nR&R, and this Order, make reference. \n1 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 1 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>On September 8, 2020, previously-assigned Magistrate Judge Steven Tiscione set a \ndiscovery schedule in this action.3 ECF No. 12. December 4, 2020 was the \"[d]eadline for \nmotions to join new parties or amend pleadings.\" Id. By the deadline, Plaintiff made no motions \nto join new parties or amend the pleadings. Judge Tiscione granted several extensions of \ndiscovery, ECF Nos. 21, 31, 37, ultimately setting a final discovery deadline of March 31, 2022. \nECFNo. 40. \nAfter the completion of discovery, Delta requested leave to file summary judgment. ECF \nNo. 50. The Court granted Delta's request and set a briefing schedule for the parties to file \nsummary judgment submissions by August 26, 2022. ECF No. 51. Delta timely filed its \nsubmissions for summary judgment. ECF Nos. 55-57. Plaintiff filed a motion to amend her \nComplaint on August 29, 2022-three days after the summary judgment submission deadline \nand over twenty months after the December 4, 2020 deadline to join new parties or amend \npleadings. ECF No. 58.4 In her motion, Plaintiff sought to substitute two named individuals for \nthe two Doe defendants, add factual allegations and three causes of action under unspecified \nstate law, and withdraw four causes of action. See ECF Nos. 58, 58-1, 70. The Court referred \nPlaintiffs motion to amend the Complaint to Judge Dunst for a Report and Recommendation. \nECFNo. 62. \nOn March 14, 2023, following briefing by the parties on Plaintiffs motion, Judge Dunst \nissued the R&R, recommending the Court grant in part and deny in part Plaintiffs motion. R&R \nat 1. Specifically, Judge Dunst recommends denying Plaintiffs request to amend the Complaint \nby adding new defendants and factual allegations and granting Plaintiffs motion to withdraw the \nComplaint's four causes of action. Id. at 24. Judge Dunst further recommends dismissing those \n3 On June 14, 2022, the case was reassigned to Judge Dunst. See June 14, 2022 Notice of Reassignment. \n4 Plaintiff also filed a motion for leave to file a sur-reply in connection with Delta's motion for summary judgment, \nECF No. 59, which the Court granted, ECF No. 62. \n2 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 2 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>four causes of actions with prejudice. Id. On March 28, 2023, Plaintiff timely filed objections \nand asked this Court to reject the R&R and grant her request to file an amended Complaint. ECF \nNo. 73. \nII. DISCUSSION \nA. Standard of Review \nIn reviewing a report and recommendation, a district court \"may accept, reject, or \nmodify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.\" 28 \nU.S.C. § 636(b )(1 )(C). Parties must serve and file any written objections to the proposed \nfindings and recommendations within fourteen days of being served with a copy of such \nproposed findings and recommendations. Id. A district judge \"shall make a de novo \ndetermination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations \nto which objection is made.\" Id. Objections to a report and recommendation must be \"specific \nand are to address only those portions of the proposed findings to which the party objects.\" \nPhillips v. Reed Grp., Ltd., 955 F. Supp. 2d 201, 211 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (Owen, J.) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). \"Where 'the objecting party makes only conclusory or \ngeneral objections, or simply reiterates the original arguments, the Court will review the report \nand recommendation strictly for clear error.\"' Norman v. Metro. Transp. Auth., 13-CV-1183, \n2014 WL 4628848, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2014) (Matsumoto, J.) (quoting Zaretsky v. Maxi­\nAids, Inc., 10-CV-3771, 2012 WL 2345181, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. June 18, 2012) (Feuerstein, J.)). \nAs Judge Dunst noted, a pro se litigant typically receives \"special solicitude\" because he \nor she \"generally lacks both legal training and experience and, accordingly, is likely to forfeit \nimportant rights through inadvertence if he [ or she] is not afforded some degree of protection.\" \nTracy v. Freshwater, 623 F.3d 90, 101 (2d Cir. 2010); see also R&R at 10. Nonetheless, the \nCourt agrees with Judge Dunst that Plaintiff does not receive special solicitude because she \"is \n3 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 3 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>an attorney practicing law in New York State and has been authorized to do so for nearly two \ndecades.\" R&R at 10. \nB. Analysis \n1. Denial of Plaintiff's Amended Complaint \nPlaintiff objects to Judge Dunst's recommendation that the Court deny Plaintiff leave to \nfile an amended complaint. ECF No. 73 at 4. The Court agrees with Judge Dunst that Plaintiff's \nrequest fails under both the more stringent Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16 standard and the \nmore lenient Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 standard. See Sacerdote v. New York Univ., 9 \nF.4th 95, 115 (2d Cir. 2021) (\"The ability of a plaintiff to amend the complaint is governed by \nRules 15 and 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which, when read together, set forth \nthree standards for amending pleadings that depend on when the amendment is sought.\"). \na. Rule 16 \nAs an initial matter, the Court agrees with Judge Dunst' s analysis of Sacerdote that Rule \n16 applies where, as here, \"motions to amend pleadings or join additional parties [are] filed after \na stated deadline for such 'motions.\"' R&R at 8. Under Rule 16, the \"period of 'liberal' \namendment ends if the district court issues a scheduling order setting a date after which no \namendment will be permitted.\" Sacerdote, 9 F.4th at 115. \"It is still possible for the plaintiff to \namend the complaint after such a deadline, but the plaintiff may do so only up a showing of the \n'good cause.'\" Id Judge Dunst correctly found that Plaintiff failed to establish good cause for \ndelay in filing an amended complaint, as required by Rule 16. Plaintiff was aware of the \nproposed additions to her Complaint \"nearly two months before the December 4, 2020 \namendment deadline and over twenty-two months before Plaintiff first moved to amend.\" R&R \nat 12. Plaintiff's new factual allegations and state law claims were based on conduct she \nallegedly experienced firsthand and could have asserted in her initial Complaint. Id at 13. \n4 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 4 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>In her objections, Plaintiff fails to mention Rule 16 or explain why it should not apply in \nlight of Judge Dunst' s analysis of Sacerdote. Plaintiff provides only conclusory statements that \nSacerdote \"establishe[s]\" that \"this lenient standard [under Rule 15] should apply.\" ECF No. 73 \nat 2. Plaintiff attempts to bolster her argument by citing additional purported Second Circuit \ncaselaw, specifically Cablevision Sys. Corp. v. Wisznia Architecture & Dev., LLC, 715 F.3d 175 \n(2d Cir. 2013) and Marrero Pichardo v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 46, 55-56 (2d Cir. 2004). Id. This \nCourt could not find a Second Circuit case under the name of \"Cablevision Sys. Corp. v. Wisznia \nArchitecture & Development, LLC.\" 5 Instead, the reporter number and year are similar to a \nSixth Circuit case-Flagg v. City of Detroit, 715 F.3d. 165 (6th Cir. 2013). However, Flagg \nmakes no mention of Rule 15, Rule 16, or amending pleadings. Furthermore, Flagg contains \nnone of the facts Plaintiff alleges. Compare Flagg, 715 F.3d 165 with ECF No. 73 at 2. \nMarrero Pichardo is an existent Second Circuit case; however, it deals with a habeas petition in \nthe immigration context and, as Delta correctly noted, \"does not discuss ... any of the issues \nraised in Plaintiffs Objections.\" ECF No. 74 at 1. Indeed, Marrero Pichardo makes no mention \nof either Rule 15 or Rule 16. 374 F.3d 46 (2d Cir. 2004). Plaintiff also cites two district court \ncases that address Rule 15: Aboah v. Fairfield Healthcare Servs., Inc., 20-CV-00763, 2022 WL \n443253, at *3 (D. Conn. Feb. 14, 2022) (Nagala, J.) and Scott v. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., \n300 F.R.D. 193, 198 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (Netbum, M.J.). ECF No. 73 at 2. Plaintiff cites these \ncases for their recitations of the Rule 15 standard without explaining why that standard, rather \nthan the standard contained in Rule 16, should apply. Id. The Court is unpersuaded by \nPlaintiffs conclusory statements that Rule 15 prevails over Rule 16 in this case. Additionally, \nthe Court maintains serious concern that at least one of Plaintiffs cited cases is non-existent and \nmay have been a hallucinated product of generative artificial intelligence, particularly given \n5 Delta also was unable to find this case. See ECF Nos. 74, 76. \n5 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 5 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>Plaintiffs recent history of similar conduct before the Second Circuit. See Park v. Kim, 91 F.4th \n610, 612 (2d Cir. 2024) (\"We separately address the conduct of Park's counsel, Attorney Jae S. \nLee. Lee's reply brief in this case includes a citation to a non-existent case, which she admits \nshe generated using the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT.\"). \nb. Rule 15 \nPlaintiff objects to Judge Dunst's holding that Plaintiffs motion to file an amended \ncomplaint \"fails to satisfy Rule 15 ... because it would impose prejudice and cause undue \ndelay.\" R&R at 19; see ECF No. 73 at 4-7. Even if Rule 15 applied, Plaintiffs objections to \nJudge Dunst's analysis are without merit. \nPlaintiff begins her objections to Judge Dunst's Rule 15 analysis by repeating, nearly \nverbatim, her reasoning from her motion to amend the Complaint. Compare ECF No. 70 at 2 \n(discussing United States ex rel. Raffington v. Bon Secours Health Sys. Inc., 285 F. Supp. 3d 759, \n765 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (Gorenstein, M.J.)) with ECF No. 73 at 5 (same). In light of the fact that \nPlaintiff \"simply reiterates [her] original arguments,\" the Court finds Judge Dunst committed no \nclear error in dismissing Plaintiffs Rule 15 arguments in the R&R. Norman v. Metro. Transp. \nAuth., 13-CV-1183, 2014 WL 4628848, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 15, 2014) (Matsumoto, J.) \n(internal citation omitted). \nPlaintiff also returns to Marrero Pichardo as a purportedly similar case in which the \nSecond Circuit held that the \"district had erred in denying the motion [to amend the complaint] \nand noting that the new causes of action and joinder of additional defendants were not futile.\" \nECF No. 73 at 5. Not so. Marrero Pichardo is inapposite because it discusses the filing of \namended habeas petitions as opposed to amended complaints pursuant to Rules 15 and 16. 374 \nF.3d 46 (2d Cir. 2004). Moreover, in that case the district court granted the plaintiffs request to \namend his habeas petition because his counsel \"had misconstrued the underlying facts\" before \nlater denying the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his habeas petition. Id \n6 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 6 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>at 50. Without mention of Rule 15, the Second Circuit in Marrero Pichardo reversed the district \ncourt's denial of reconsideration where the plaintiff sought to submit only one new claim based \non recent caselaw, not multiple \"new causes of action\" or \"additional defendants.\" \nPlaintiff points to another Second Circuit case-Ricciuti v. New York City Transit \nAuthority-in attempting to highlight a reversal of a district court's denial of the plaintiffs \nmotion to amend the complaint after the defendant filed for summary judgment because, \naccording to Plaintiff, the \"district court had erred in finding undue delay.\" ECF No. 73 at 5; see \nalso Ricciuti v. NYC Transit Auth., 941 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1991). Plaintiff again \nmischaracterizes this case. The district court in Ricciuti did not make an undue delay finding and \ninstead dismissed the complaint \"for failure to state a claim.\" 941 F.2d at 120. \nPlaintiff objects to Judge Dunst's finding of undue delay by noting she and a deponent \nseparately suffered injuries and pandemic-related illnesses. ECF No. 73 at 6. But Plaintiff \nprovided no explanation for how these facts, if true, caused Plaintiff to wait over twenty months \nfrom the December 4, 2020 deadline to seek leave to file an amended complaint. These injuries \nand illnesses do not change the fact that Plaintiff could have asserted her proposed new \nallegations and state law claims \"when she commenced this litigation over two years before \nseeking to amend.\" R&R at 16. Judge Dunst also noted that Delta disclosed the identities of the \ntwo employees Plaintiff seeks to add as new defendants \"nearly two months before the December \n4, 2020 amendment deadline and over twenty-two months before Plaintiff first moved to amend.\" \nId. at 12. Plaintiff did not inform the Court at or soon after the amendment deadline that she \nintended to add named defendants, factual allegations, or causes of action but was facing delays \ndue to injury or illness. Plaintiffs objections do not dissuade the Court that Judge Dunst was \ncorrect in concluding that \"these circumstances reflect undue delay.\" Id. at 16. \nPlaintiff also argues Defendants do not face undue prejudice because, according to \nPlaintiff, \"no additional discovery is necessary for the new causes of action, as they merely \n7 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 7 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>clarify and correct errors and inaccuracies.\" ECF No. 73 at 7. However, as Judge Dunst wrote, \n\"Plaintiff ignores that discovery 'is not a one-way street designed to allow plaintiffs to collect \nevidence in support of their claims. It is also a mechanism for defendants to accumulate \nevidence to defend themselves and to test the evidence of their opponents.'\" R&R at 18 (quoting \nFioranelli v. CBS Broad, Inc., 15-CV-952, 2019 WL 1059993, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 2019) \n(Broderick, J.). Although Plaintiff may be finished with discovery, she does not speak for \nDefendants. Facing new factual allegations, new claims, and newly named defendants, \nDefendants would likely reopen discovery and commence new motion practice, as noted by \nJudge Dunst. R&R at 16-18. Accordingly, Plaintiffs objections do not raise any new issues \nthat disturb Judge Dunst' s finding that \"allowing Plaintiff to file the [proposed amended \ncomplaint] would clearly prejudice Delta\" given that discovery is closed and Delta already \nmoved for summary judgment. Id at 17. \n2. Dismissal With Prejudice of Plaintiffs Withdrawal \nClaims \nPlaintiff objects to Judge Dunst's recommendation that the Court \"dismiss Plaintiffs \nwithdrawal claims in the proposed amended complaint with prejudice.\" ECF No. 73 at 7. The \nCourt agrees with Judge Dunst that dismissal with prejudice of the four causes of action Plaintiff \nseeks to withdraw \"is proper and in the interest of judicial economy.\" R&R at 19. \nPlaintiff argues Judge Dunst erred in citing two cases to support dismissing the \nwithdrawn claims. ECF No. 73 at 7. The first case Plaintiff takes issue with is Kilpakis v. \nJPMorgan Chase Fin. Co., LLC, 229 F. Supp. 3d 133, 140 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (Spart, J.). ECF No. \n73 at 7. Plaintiff states the district court in that case \"actually granted leave to file the proposed \namended complaint and granted the withdrawal claims.\" Id Judge Dunst does not deny this, nor \nis it incongruous with his conclusions. See R&R at 19-20 (describing Kilpakis as \"granting \nmotion to amend to the extent plaintiff sought to withdraw her New York Fair Credit Reporting \n8 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 8 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>Act claim\") ( emphasis added). Judge Dunst cites Kilpakis to highlight an example of a district \ncourt granting a motion to amend a complaint/or the purpose of withdrawing claims. \nNext, Plaintiff states Judge Dunst's citation to Kwan v. Schlein, 634 F.3d 224,230 (2d \nCir. 2011) was erroneous because \"the Kwan case did not involve a motion to amend the \ncomplaint or withdraw claims.\" ECF No. 73 at 7. Plaintiff misconstrues Kwan and Judge \nDunst's reasoning. The defendants in Kwan sought leave from the district court to \"dismiss their \ncounterclaims voluntarily.\" Kwan, 634 F.3d at 228. Because Plaintiff failed to specify whether \nshe seeks to dismiss her claims with or without prejudice, Judge Dunst properly cited Kwan to \noutline the \"[t]wo lines of authority\" and their respective elements for determining when \ndismissal of claims with or without prejudice is proper. R&R at 20 (citing Kwan, 634 F.3d at \n230). While Kilpakis and Kwan do not contain all the same facts as the instant case, these cases \nare not analyzed in isolation. Taken together with the other citations in section III(C) of the \nR&R, these cases undermine Plaintiffs allegation that \"there appears to be no proper legal \nauthority or reasoning to dismiss the withdrawal claims with prejudice if the amended complaint \nis not permitted.\" ECF No. 73 at 7; see R&R at 20-24. \nAccordingly, the Court agrees with Judge Dunst that dismissal with prejudice of the four \ncauses of action Plaintiff seeks to withdraw is warranted. R&R at 20-24 (finding four of the five \nZagano factors weighed in favor of dismissal with prejudice); see Zagano v. Fordham Univ., 900 \nF.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir. 1990). \nCLAIM UNDER 42 U.S.C. § 1981 \nI. SUMMARY JUDGMENT \nIn adopting the R&R, the Court dismisses all causes of actions explicitly listed in \nPlaintiffs Complaint. However, Plaintiff asserts that, because the preliminary statement in her \nComplaint referenced a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, ECF No. 1 at 1, this too should be \n9 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 9 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>considered as a cause of action. ECF No. 60 at 10-19. Delta maintains that Plaintiff has not \nproperly pled a claim under§ 1981, but nonetheless addresses the claim on the merits in its \nsummary judgment papers. While the Court is skeptical that this claim has been properly pled, 6 \nit decides the issue on the merits as fully briefed by the parties. See Memorandum of Law in \nSupport of Delta's Motion for Summary Judgment at 15-21, ECF No. 55-9; Plaintiffs \nMemorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment at 10-19, \nECF No. 60; Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Delta's Motion for Summary \nJudgment at 7-21, ECF No. 56-7; Plaintiffs Sur-Reply Memorandum of Law in Further \nOpposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 66.7 After careful consideration of the \nissues, the Court holds that, even if Plaintiff listed § 1981 as a fifth cause of action with factual \nallegations properly attributed, Plaintiffs § 1981 claim does not survive summary judgment. \nA. Background \nThe Court has considered the parties' Local Rule 56.1 Statements, declarations, \ndeposition testimony, and all other evidence pertaining to Delta's motion for summary judgment. \n6 Judge Dunst treats Plaintiff as having asserted a § 19 81 claim because, according to Judge Dunst, \"the parties' \nsummary judgment briefmg treats the Complaint as having asserted a Section 1981 cause of action.\" R&R at 6 n.9. \nThe Court disagrees with Judge Dunst's assessment and his description of the parties' briefmg. Delta does not treat \nthis claim as properly pled, instead arguing that \"Plaintiff only referenced [42 U.S.C. § 1981] in the Preliminary \nStatement of her Complaint with no further citation.\" Reply Memorandum of Law at 7-8, ECF No. 56-7. Further, \nthe general pleading rules require \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to \nrelief.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). A single mention of the statute in the preliminary statement with no other mention \nin the body of the complaint or as one of the enumerated causes of action is likely insufficient to satisfy Rule 8. See \nConcey v. New York State Unified Ct. Sys., 08 Civ. 8858, 2011 WL 4549386, at *21 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2011) \n(Gardephe, J.) (\"Plaintiff also cites Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000(d) in the preliminary statement of his Amended \nComplaint, but he does not plead a Title VI violation in the body of the Amended Complaint, nor does he state a \nTitle VI cause of action. Accordingly, there is no Title VI claim in this case.\"). Nonetheless, \"[a] plaintiff may also \nassert a discrimination claim against an individual under§ 1981 or the [New York State Human Rights Law, or \n\"NYSHRL\"] based on roughly this same standard.\" Jackson v. Battaglia, 63 F. Supp. 3d 214,222 (N.D.N.Y. 2014) \n(Hurd, J. ). Plaintiffs third cause of action is pursuant to the NYSHRL, and the associated factual allegations are \nsufficiently similar for the purposes of a§ 1981 claim. ECF No. 1 at 8. Moreover, the parties have fully briefed the \nissue, so the Court addresses the arguments on the merits. \n7 On September 7, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiffs request to file a sur-reply in opposition to Delta's motion for \nsummary judgment by Friday, September 16, 2022 at 5:00 P.M. ECF No. 64. Plaintiff filed two sur-replies on \nSeptember 16, 2022 at 5:18 P.M., ECF No. 66, and 6:22 P.M., ECF No. 67. The Court denied Delta's request to \nstrike Plaintiffs sur-replies, ECF Entry on September 20, 2022; however, the Court need not consider Plaintiffs \nsecond sur-reply, ECF No. 67, which the Court did not grant. \n10 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 10 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>Where facts in a party's Rule 56.1 Statement are supported by citations to evidence and denied \nby conclusory statements without citations to conflicting evidence, the Court finds such facts to \nbe admitted. See E.D.N.Y. Local Civ. Rules 56.l(c)-(d). The Court finds the following facts to \nbe undisputed and construes such facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, the non-moving \nparty. \nOn August 28, 2019, Plaintiff traveled on a first-class ticket with Delta from Charlotte, \nNorth Carolina to New York City, New York. Rule 56.1 Statement of Material Facts in Support \nof Delta's Motion for Summary Judgment ,r,r 1-2, ECF No. 55-8. At the airport in Charlotte, \nPlaintiffs flight was delayed. Id. ,r 3. Plaintiff received from Delta an earlier flight with a first­\nclass seat. Id. ,r 6. During the boarding process, a Delta Gate Agent learned there was a seat \nduplication issue with Plaintiffs seat. Id. ,r,r 34-35. The Delta Gate Agent informed Plaintiff \nthat her seat had been reassigned and she would no longer be seated in first class; however, \nPlaintiff refused to vacate her seat. Id. ,r,r 40-42. The Delta Gate Agent then spoke with her \nsupervisor about the seat duplication issue regarding Plaintiff and another passenger. Id. ,r,r 42, \n49-51. The supervisor spoke to Plaintiff as well as the other passenger, who agreed to travel in \ntheir previously assigned seat. Id. ,r,r 55-57. Plaintiff remained in her first-class seat and \ncontinued on the flight to her destination in New York City. Id. ,r,r 64-65. \nOn April 6, 2020, Plaintiff filed the instant action, alleging Defendants engaged in \"racial \ndiscrimination and wrongful profiling of a peaceful Asian-American passenger\" when a Delta \nGate Agent allegedly told Plaintiff to vacate her seat for a white passenger. ECF No. 1 at 1. On \nJuly 8, 2022, Delta served a motion for summary judgment, arguing it is entitled to judgment as a \nmatter oflaw as there are no genuine disputes regarding any material facts. ECF Nos. 52, 55. \n11 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 11 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Delta's summary judgment motion as to the \npurported§ 1981 claim against all Defendants.8 \nB. LegalStandard \nSummary judgment is appropriate where \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to \ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no \ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a \nmatter oflaw.\" Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). \"An issue of fact is genuine \nif 'the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.' ... \nA fact is material if it 'might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.'\" Roe v. \nCity of Waterbury, 542 F.3d 31, 35 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 \nU.S. 242, 248 (1986)). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the Court must \"construe \nthe facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and must resolve all ambiguities and \ndraw all reasonable inferences against the movant.\" Brod v. Omya, Inc., 653 F.3d 156, 164 (2d \nCir. 2011) (quoting Williams v. R.H Donnelley, Corp., 368 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir. 2004)). The \nmovant has the burden of showing the absence of a disputed issue of material fact, after which \nthe burden shifts to the nonmoving party to present specific evidence showing a genuine dispute. \nSee Brown v. Eli Lilly & Co., 654 F.3d 347, 358 (2d Cir. 2011). \nC. Discussion \nA claim of racial discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 requires showing: \"(1) plaintiffs \nare members of a racial minority; (2) defendants' intent to discriminate on the basis of race; and \n(3) discrimination concerning one of the statute's enumerated activities.\" Brown v. City of \nOneonta, 221 F.3d 329, 339 (2d Cir. 2000). \"Those enumerated activities include the rights 'to \n8 The purported§ 1981 claim is dismissed as to all Defendants. Plaintiff does not differentiate her claim between \nthe three Defendants. Moreover, Plaintiffs claim would suffer the same infirmities as to Defendants John and Jane \nDoe. \n12 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 12 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of \nall laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property.\"' Id. ( quoting 42 U.S.C. § \n1981(a)). Claims under§ 1981 are analyzed using the burden-shifting framework established in \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), which the Second Circuit has \ninterpreted to mean that \"once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination, the \nburden shifts to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the \nemployer's action against the employee. If the employer does so, then the burden shifts back to \nthe employee to show that the employer's articulated reason is pretext for discrimination.\" Carr \nv. NYC. Transit Auth., 76 F.4th 172, 177 (2d Cir. 2023) (quoting Truitt v. Salisbury Bank & Tr. \nCo., 52 F.4th 80, 86-87 (2d Cir. 2022)). \"Although the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting \nframework was originally introduced for the purpose of analyzing employment discrimination \nclaims under Title VII, it has been similarly employed by plaintiffs alleging intentional \ndiscrimination under Section 1981.\" Bary v. Delta Airlines, Inc., CV-02-5202, 2009 WL \n3260499, at *8 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2009) (Trager, J.). \nIn her Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that the Delta Gate Agent \"yelled\" at Plaintiff to \n\"move to an economy seat so that the white girl can sit in your seat. Or, you must get off and \nwait for the next flight.\" ECF No. 1 at 3. Delta agrees there was initially an issue regarding \nPlaintiffs seat, but asserts a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. Specifically, Delta claims the \nseat issue stemmed from the Delta Gate Agent's \"erroneous duplicate seating assignment.\" ECF \nNo. 55-9 at 19. Citing the Delta Gate Agent's deposition testimony and Delta's Passenger Name \nRecord (\"PNR\"), which catalogs passenger ticketing data, Delta explains that the Delta Gate \nAgent made the duplicate seat assignment before she physically met Plaintiff or was otherwise \naware of Plaintiffs race. Id.; Exhibit D, Loret Dep. at 80:5-81:12, ECF No. 55-6; Exhibit 3, \nPNR at 6, ECF No. 56-6. See Texas Dep 't of Cmty. Affs. v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 257 (1981) \n(\"[T]o satisfy this intermediate burden [of the McDonnell Douglas test], the [defendant] need \n13 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 13 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>only produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that \nthe ... decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus.\"). \nEven assuming, arguendo, that Plaintiffs allegations sufficiently carry her primafacie \nburden, the Court finds Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that Delta's proffered non­\ndiscriminatory reason for the events was, in fact, pretextual. In her Opposition, Plaintiff stated­\nwithout citation-that the Delta Gate Agent provided the duplicate ticket \"to the white passenger \nAFTER Plaintiff went [through] the boarding gate,\" ECF No. 60 at 17-18, and that \"[t]his was \ndone intentionally as one cannot accidentally issue a ticket,\" id. at 18. An unsupported assertion \nthat the Delta Gate Agent provided the duplicate ticket to the white passenger after Plaintiff \nboarded does not refute Delta's evidence showing that the Delta Gate Agent entered the \nerroneous duplicate assignment into the computer system before being aware of Plaintiffs race. \nFurthermore, Plaintiff provides no explanation for her conclusory statement that it is not possible \nto accidentally issue a ticket. Schwapp v. Town of Avon, 118 F.3d 106, 110 (2d Cir. 1997) \n(\"[E]ven in the discrimination context, a plaintiff must provide more than conclusory allegations \nof discrimination to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\"). \nInstead, Plaintiff submits a new affidavit as part of her Opposition, ECF No. 60-3; \nhowever, a substantial portion of the information provided in the new affidavit contradicts \nPlaintiffs statements in her earlier deposition. See ECF No. 56-7 at 9-10 (listing examples of \ncontradictions). For example, in her new affidavit, Plaintiff wrote for the first time that the Delta \nGate Agent \"sneered, saying ASIAN! first class?\" and told Plaintiff \"no no no no you shouldn't \nseat at the first class. You should go to an economy seat.\" ECF No. 60-3 ,r 10. However, in her \ndeposition, Plaintiff said the Delta Gate Agent and her supervisor did not make any racially \nderogatory remarks to her. Plaintiffs Dep. at 39:15--41:5, 52:17-53:3, ECF No. 55-4. Similarly, \nPlaintiff alleges in her new affidavit that the Delta Gate Agent \"grabbed [her] neck, arms and \nshoulders to forcedly remove [her]\" from her seat, ECF No. 60-3 ,r 16, while she testified during \n14 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 14 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>her deposition she \"believe[s]\" that the Delta Gate Agent \"touched my-my body somewhere,\" \nPlaintiffs Dep. at 43:25-44:1, ECF No. 55-4, then that the Delta Gate Agent touched her arm, \nid. at 45:5, and then that she did not \"remember exactly what part of my body\" the Delta Gate \nAgent touched, id at 45: 1 7-18. The Court does not credit Plaintiffs new affidavit. See Mack v. \nUnited States, 814 F.2d 120, 124 (2d Cir. 1987) (\"It is well settled in this circuit that a party's \naffidavit which contradicts his own prior deposition testimony should be disregarded on a motion \nfor summary judgment.\"). \nIn her Opposition and Sur-Reply, Plaintiff submits only one other affidavit besides her \nown, specifically a deposition from non-party witness Sheri Critchfield, who was a flight \nattendant on the same flight. See ECF Nos. 60-2, 60-4. However, three months before Plaintiff \nserved her Opposition, Judge Tiscione ordered that \"Plaintiff is precluded from offering the \npurported deposition [ of Ms. Critchfield] upon written questions for any purpose in this \nlitigation.\" ECF No. 49. Judge Tiscione found that Plaintiffs purported deposition failed to \ncomply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure both because (1) \"there was no deposition \nofficer present to swear the witness, take the witness' verbatim testimony, and certify in writing \nthat the witness was duly sworn and that the deposition accurately records the witness' \ntestimony\" and (2) because \"Plaintiff. .. depr_iv[ ed] Defendants of the opportunity to provide their \nown written questions.\" Id. Judge Tiscione added \"[t]o the extent that Plaintiff seeks to convert \nthe improper deposition into an affidavit from the witness, such a request is denied because the \ndocument does not conform to the requirements for a sworn affidavit.\" Id. Plaintiff attempts to \nshoehorn in the exact materials Judge Tiscione prohibited. The Court, therefore, disregards the \npurported affidavit and deposition of Ms. Critchfield. \nPlaintiff argues her case is similar to the decision in James v. American Airlines, Inc., in \nwhich the court denied a motion to dismiss a racial discrimination claim against the airline \ncompany under§ 1981. 247 F. Supp. 3d 297 (E.D.N.Y. 2017) (Chen, J.). Plaintiff states \"as \n15 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 15 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>James Court concluded that when Defendants forced the plaintiff to move via threats, \nharassment, and abuse, Defendant altered the contractual conditions between Plaintiff and \nDefendants. Thus, the Plaintiff's right to enjoy all benefits was affected, as is the case here.\" \nECF No. 60 at 19. The Court disagrees with Plaintiff's comparison. In James, the court found \nthat the airline altered plaintiff's contractual conditions not only by forcing her to move seats, but \nalso by prohibiting her from \"cursing whereas the white woman's cont[r]act with American \nwas not so conditioned.\" James, 247 F. Supp. 3d at 305. In the instant case, Defendants did not \nplace a new condition, such as a no cursing requirement, on Plaintiff as compared to the white \npassenger. Moreover, Defendants also did not force Plaintiff to move seats. The Court agrees \nwith Delta that \"Plaintiff never alleges that she was denied boarding; that she was forced to \nchange her seat; or that she had to fly in any class other than first-class in her originally assigned \nseat on the flight to New York's LaGuardia Airport.\" ECF No. 55-9 at 18. Unlike in James, \nPlaintiff's contractual conditions were not altered. \nPlaintiff fails to rebut Delta's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the ticketing \nissue-namely, that the seat assignments were erroneously duplicated. Instead, she falls back on \nconclusory statements, such as her statement that the Delta Gate Agent \"intentionally issued a \nduplicate 1 C seat assignment of Plaintiff's seat to the young white passenger. Defendants \nshowed intentional racial discrimination intent here.\" ECF No. 60 at 7. The Court is \nunpersuaded by such statements and finds that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact. \nSee Kulakv. City of New York, 88 F.3d 63, 71 (1996) (holding that \"conclusory statements, \nconjecture, or speculation by the party resisting the motion will not defeat summary judgment\") .. \nFor the foregoing reasons, Delta's motion for summary judgment as to the purportedly \nasserted§ 1981 claim, ECF No. 55, is granted. The purported§ 1981 claim is dismissed as to all \nDefendants because Plaintiff does not differentiate her claim between the three Defendants and \nbecause the claim would suffer the same infirmities as to Defendants John and Jane Doe. \n16 Case 2:20-cv-01705-WFK-LGD     Document 79     Filed 03/22/24     Page 16 of 17 PageID #:\n<pageID>s/ WFKCONCLUSION \nUpon a careful review of Judge Dunst's R&R, ECF No. 72, and the objections filed \nthereto, ECF No. 73, and for the foregoing reasons, the Court ADOPTS the R&R. Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs motion seeking leave to amend the Complaint, ECF No. 70, is GRANTED in part and \nDENIED in part by denying Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint and dismissing the \nComplaint's four causes of action-for violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the \nFederal Aviation Law, the New York Executive Law, and the New York Civil Rights Law-with \nprejudice. Because the four withdrawn causes of action are dismissed with prejudice and \nsummary judgment of Plaintiffs purported ly asserted claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 is granted, \nthere are no remaining claims. Therefore, Plaintiffs Complaint is DISMISSED as moot. The \nClerk of Court is respectfully directed to close the case. \nDated: March 21, 2024 \nBrooklyn, New York ~ \n~ HON.WILLIAM F.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves K.P., a minor with disabilities, who sought to use a hand-held calculator during a computerized MAP test, a measure devised by the Northwest Evaluation Association (NWEA), arguing that her rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) were violated. Although the AI or automated system aspect is not explicitly discussed, the computerized MAP test, which features an on-screen calculator for specific questions only, establishes the context for the requested accommodation. The court upheld the defendant's decision, denying a preliminary injunction for the use of the hand-held calculator, partly reasoning that such accommodation could potentially skew test validity and results.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the refusal to allow K.P. to use a hand-held calculator during a standardized test violated her rights under the IDEA and ADA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, agreeing with the magistrate judge's recommendation. The court held that the refusal likely did not violate the IDEA because the lack of written notice did not cause substantive harm due to the parents' awareness of the testing conditions. Moreover, the court found the ADA claim unlikely to succeed, reasoning that allowing K.P. to use a hand-held calculator was not a reasonable accommodation as it would interfere with the integrity of the test designed to measure actual math computation skills.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A student named K.P. needed special help because she learns differently from other kids. Her school wouldn't let her use a regular calculator on a test because they thought it would make her scores unfair compared to other students. The test already had a digital calculator for some math questions. Her mom disagreed and took the school to court. The court sided with the school, saying that using the regular calculator would give her an unfair advantage because the test wanted to see how she solves math problems on her own.",

Guzmán\n)\nCITY OF CHICAGO SD #299, )\n)\nDefendant. )\nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER\nPlaintiff alleges that defendant violated the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\n(“IDEA”) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) by refusing to let her use a hand-heldcalculator while taking the Northwest Evaluation Association Measure of Academic Progress(“MAP”) test.  Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which the Court referred toMagistrate Judge Cole for a Report and Recommendation (“R&R”).  After briefing and argument,Judge Cole issued an R&R recommending that the motion be denied.  The case is before the Courton plaintiff’s objections to the R&R.  For the reasons set forth below, the Court overrules theobjections, adopts the R&R in its entirety, and denies plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction. \nFacts\nK.P. is an eighth grader who is eligible for special education services.  (Compl. ¶ 3.)  In\nJanuary 2013, the parties created an Individualized Education Plan (“IEP”) for K.P. that includes “useof a calculator” as a classroom mathematics accommodation, and states that K.P. will “participate inthe district [and state] assessments WITH ALLOWABLE accommodations/modifications that areCase: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 1 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>necessary to measure academic achievement and functional performance.”  (R&R at 3; see City\nMem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 10, 1/29/ 13 IEP at 7, 9.)  The 2013 IEP does not list a hand-\nheld calculator as an accommodation.  ( See generally  City Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex.\n10, 1/29/13 IEP.)\nSometime between January 2013 and July 2014, de fendant started requiring students to obtain\na threshold MAP score to qualify to take the en trance exams for selective enrollment high schools\nand using the test score as one-third of the 900 point selection rubric for those schools.  (R&R at 4.) The MAP test is taken on a computer, and for a portion of the math questions, an on-screen calculatorpops up for the student to use.  ( Id. at 3.)  For the rest of the ma th questions, however, the calculator\ndisappears, and the students must perform computations on their own.  ( Id.)\nThe Northwest Evaluation Association (“NWEA”), which created the MAP test, recognizes\ntwo kinds of accommodations:  (1) standard (also called allowable) accommodations; and (2) non-standard accommodations.  ( Id. at 4; see Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA\nAccommodations for MAP® Assessments at 1-2.)  Standard accommodations are those that “will beirrelevant to, or only minimally affect the validity of the student’s test score.”  (R&R at 4; see Def.’s\nMem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA Accommodations for MAP® Assessments at 1.) Non-standard accommodations are those that “have the potential  to bias the students’ test score,” and\ninclude “[u]sing a calculator for questions that do not have an on-screen calculator.”  (R&R at 4; see\nDef.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA Accommodations for MAP® Assessmentsat 2) (emphasis original).  The NWEA does not preclude schools from making non-standardaccommodations during MAP tests if, for example, an IEP requires it.  ( See Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s\nMot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA Accommodations for MAP® Assessments at 2.)  “However, [the\n2Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>school] leadership has the responsibility for . . . interp ret[ing] . . . the test results” and “track[ing] non-\nstandard accommodations so they can be factored in interpretations.”  ( Id.)  Further, the NWEA states\nthat “[t]he greater the use of non-standard accommodations . . . , the weaker the validity of theinference that can be drawn from the student’s score,” which “should be considered when interpretingtest scores or using them to make important educational decisions.”  ( Id.)\nIn May 2014, after discovering that the use of hand-held calculators was generally not\npermitted during the MAP test, K.P.’s mother wrote a letter to defendant asking whether K.P. would\nbe allowed to use one pursuant to her IEP.   (R&R at 5.)  Defendant did not respond to her letter,  butshe was contacted shortly thereafter about updating K.P.’s IEP.  ( Id.)  The parties met in July and\ncreated a new IEP that lists both “use of a calculator” and “[u]se [of a] hand held calculator” asclassroom mathematics accommodations, but also states that K.P. will take district and stateassessments “WITH ALLOWABLE accommodations/modifications.”  ( Id. at 3-4; see City Mem.\nOpp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 11, 7/16/14 IEP at 6-9.)\nIn September 2014, K.P.’s mother asked defendant to confirm that K.P. would be allowed to\nuse a hand-held calculator during the math portion of  the MAP test, which K.P. was scheduled to take\non October 4, 2014.\n1  (R&R at 6.)  Defendant told her that  K.P. would not be allowed to do so, and\nthis suit followed.\n1Defendant agreed to postpone the test until after this Court’s ruling on the objections to\nthe R&R.  ( See id. at 9 n.5.) \n3Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>Discussion\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(a) instructs the Court to make a de novo determination\nof those portions of the R&R to which plaintiff objects.  Id.  The Court may “accept, reject, or\nmodify” the R&R, “receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge withinstructions.”  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).\nPlaintiff objects to the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that she is unlikely to succeed on her\nclaim that defendant violated the IDEA by failing to give her parents prior notice of the removal ofthe hand-held calculator accommodation from her IEP.  ( See Compl., Count I); 20 U.S.C. §\n1415(b)(3)(A) (requiring a school to give “[w]ritten prior notice to the parents of the child, . . .whenever [it] . . . propose[s] to in itiate or change” an IEP).  As an initial matter, the Magistrate Judge\nsaid it was not clear that there had actually been a change in plaintiff’s IEP, “given [its] wording . .\n. [,] its explicit limitation to ‘ALLOWABLE’ accommodations, [and] the NWEA guidelines onnon-standard accommodations.”  (R&R at 8.)  Even if there had been one, however, Judge Cole saidK.P.’s parents had actual notice of the alleged change, and thus the lack of written notice neitherprejudiced them nor violated the IDEA:\n. . . .  As far as the notice requirement, there is no harm, no foul because, as is clear\nfrom the plaintiffs’ submissions, they were well aware that K.P. would not be allowedthe hand-held calculator accommodation on portions of the Test where there is noon-screen calculator.  They have identified no prejudice resulting from lack of written\nnotice.  Nor have they cited any case law in support of injunctive relief for the failureto provide written notice.  They’ve filed suit, have had the testing schedule altered toallow for adjudication of their Americans With Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claim, andwill have their day in court without harm to K.P. \n(Id. at 9) (emphasis original). \nPlaintiff contends that this conclusion is erroneous because even a  non-prejudicial  violation\nof the notice provision is actionable.  The Court disagrees.  The purpose of the IDEA’s notice\n4Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>provision is “to ensure that the parents of a child with a disability are both notified of decisions\naffecting their child and given an opportunity to object to these decisions.”   C.H. v. Cape Henlopen\nSch. Dist. , 606 F.3d 59, 70 (3d Cir. 2010).  “Thus in cases where a violation of a notification\nrequirement does not actually impair the parents’ knowledge of, or participation in, educationaldecisions, the violation is not a substantive harm under the IDEA.”  Id.; see K.A. ex rel. F.A. v. Fulton\nCnty. Sch.

Dist. , 507 F.3d 1060, 1065 (7th Cir. 2007) (stating,  in the context of a school’s failure\nto hold a second IEP meeting, that “this procedural violation does not rise to the level of a denial of\na free appropriate public education . . . . [because the] parents’ rights were [not] in any meaningfulway infringed”).  Such is the case here.  Therefore,  the Court agrees with Magistrate Judge Cole that\nplaintiff does not have a likelihood of success on the merits of her IDEA claim.\nJudge Cole also concluded that plaintiff is not likely to succeed on her ADA claim because\nshe did not show that the accommodation she seeks is reasonable:\nAllowing K.P. to use a calculator to answer questions that are designed to assess her\nability to perform math calculations is not an accommodation that in the plaintiffs’words “level the playing field.”  Quite the contrary.  It would permit K.P. to replaceher allegedly limited computational skills with a mechanical tool of infinite capacity\n5Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>(at least in the context of this case) that likely exceeds the computational capabilities\nof perhaps all – and certainly most – non-disa bled students.  That is not a reasonable\naccommodation but a substitution of artificial intelligence for the very skill the Testseeks to measure.\nPlaintiffs allow that K.P.’s use of a hand-held calculator throughout the entire math\ntest will lead CPS to invalidat e the results, but insist that should . . . that occur that\nwill raise an issue that may be “ultimately be decided in this forum or elsewhere.”(Dkt. # 7-1, at 6). Implicit in this argument is a recognition that the Test will beinvalidated, thereby ensuring future litigation over the permissibility of thatinvalidation. But, an accommodation that serves to scrap the results of a three hourtest – and prompts additional litigation – does not qualify as “reasonable.”Accommodations are not reasonable if they impose undue financial andadministrative burdens.\n(R&R at 10-11) (footnotes and citations omitted). \nPlaintiff contends that she offered evidence, the declarations of her mother, J.P., and her\nlearning disabilities specialist, Katherine Siavelis, to show that her use of a hand-held calculatorwould not render her test results invalid, but Judge Cole erroneously refused to consider them.  ( See\nPl.’s Objs. at 4; R&R at 6-7 n.4 (stating that he disregarded the declarations because plaintiff\nsubmitted them for the first time on reply and the relevant portion of J.P.’s declaration wasinadmissible).)  Even if Judge Cole had considered the declarations, however, it would not havehelped plaintiff’s case.  Siavelis’ declaration does not address the validity issue at all, and J.P.’sdeclaration only addresses it through inadmissible hearsay.  ( See Pl.’s Reply, Ex. 4, J.P. Decl. ¶¶ 34-\n35 (quoting a passage from an article published by an education consortium); see generally id. , Ex.\n5, Siavelis Decl.).)  Because the declarations would not have bolstered plaintiff’s proof even if JudgeCole had considered them, his refusal to do so was not erroneous.  \nPlaintiff also argues that there is no basis for the finding that K.P.’s use of a hand-held\ncalculator would, in fact, render the test results i nvalid.  (Pl.’s Objs. at 7.)  Once again, the Court\ndisagrees.  The record shows that the MAP test’s cr eator:  (1) deems the use of a hand-held calculator\n6Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>to be a non-standard accommodation, i.e., one that has the potential to bias the score; (2) cautions\nschools that “the greater the use of non-standard acco mmodations . . . , the weaker the validity of the\ninference that can be drawn from the student’s score,” and discourages them from relying on suchinferences “to make important educational decisions”; and (3) makes schools responsible forinterpreting MAP test results and factoring the use of non-standard accommodations into thoseinterpretations.  (R&R at 4; see Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’s Mot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 6, NWEA\nAccommodations for MAP® Assessments).  It further shows that defendant, the party vested withthe authority to and responsibility for interpreting the test results, deems MAP scores obtained by astudent who uses a hand-held calculator throughout the test to be invalid.  (Def.’s Mem. Opp’n Pl.’sMot. Prelim. Inj., Ex. 4, Barker Decl. ¶¶ 1, 13-14 (testimony of defendant’s Chief AccountabilityOfficer that, based on the NWEA guidance,“[i]f defe ndant learn[s] that a student used a non-standard\naccommodation, his/her score will be invalidated” and will not be used for determining eligibility forselective enrollment high school testing or admissions). )  In short, Judge Cole’s conclusion that the\naccommodation plaintiff seeks is unreasonable because  it would invalidate he r MAP test results is\nfully supported by the record.\nFinally, plaintiff objects to Judge Cole’s determination that the public interest disfavors\ninjunctive relief because K.P.’s use of a hand-held  calculator would give her more time to complete\nthe test than other students.  (Pl.’s Objs. at 3; see R&R at 16.)  Plaintiff asserts that the MAP test is\nnot timed, and thus the “advantage” identified by the Magistrate Judge is illusory.  Even if plaintiff’s\nassertion about the test is true, and she cites no evidence to support it, that fact would not changeJudge Cole’s conclusion about the public interest factor.  Rather, as the R&R makes clear, Judge\n7Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>Cole’s conclusion was based on the overall advantage over other students that the requested\naccommodation would give K.P.:\n[I]f plaintiffs’ contention is accepted, while other students are working through\nmathematical calculations in their head as best as their capabilities will permit, withinevitable mistakes, K.P. need only turn to her calculator to achieve likely perfectresults.  Moreover, because of the increased speed with which the calculator willenable her to go through the problems, K.P. will have more time than other studentsto answer the more difficult questions as she progresses through the phases of theTest, thereby effectively multiplying K.P.’s extra time accommodation as well.\nThe only sticking point might be if the plaintiffs’ contention – which is unsupported\nby any evidence – that incorrect answers on the calculation questions will rob K.P.of her opportunity to answer questions about mathematical concepts is correct.  Evenif it is, though, there is an inequity when the other students are considered.  Supposethere is an “adaptive” basketball skills competition that includes a dunk portion andthree-point shooting portion.  For every successful dunk, a player gets 5 three-pointshot attempts. One player – who has no problem shooting long range – has a handicapthat prevents him from jumping and he demands and receives a ten-foot ladder for thedunk portion of the Test.  The accommodated player is guaranteed not only a perfect\nscore on the dunk contest, but far more three-point attempts that the other players.That’s not a “level playing field,” and the public interest in fairness to the otherplayers – the other students here – is compromised.     \n(R&R at 16-17.)  Because the time element was not determinative of the public interest inquiry,\nJudge Cole’s alleged error is not a basis for rejecting his conclusion.\n8Case: 1:14-cv-07296 Document #: 33 Filed: 02/25/15 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>Conclusion\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court overrules plaintiff’s objections to Magistrate Judge\nCole’s R&R, adopts the R&R [21] in its entirety, and denies plaintiff’s motion for a preliminaryinjunction [4].\nSO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case is about Harshkumar Patel, an Indian national residing in the U.S., who filed for U Nonimmigrant Status and employment authorization after being a victim of a crime, but experienced significant delays in processing his applications. Patel sued the USCIS Director for this delay, seeking a timely resolution under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court dismissed his complaint due to the lack of jurisdiction, as the discretion over such delays in immigration application processes by the USCIS is not subject to judicial review. Artificial intelligence (AI) or automated systems are not explicitly mentioned in this case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court has jurisdiction to review and compel the USCIS to expedite its adjudication of Patel's immigration application processes, particularly the discretion in processing U Visa-related applications and Employment Authorization Documents.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it lacks jurisdiction to review the decision-making pace of the USCIS regarding the processing of Patel's applications, as it pertains to the agency's discretionary authority, which is shielded from judicial review under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you applied for a special permit because you helped the police catch a bad guy, and because of that, you hoped to get permission to work in the U.S. But the people in charge of giving out those permits are taking a long time, and you're tired of waiting. So, you went to a judge and asked them to make those people hurry up. The judge said, \"Sorry, I can't help you because those people have the right to take their time if they want to; it's not something I can tell them to do faster.\"",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA \n \nHARSHKUMAR PATEL,  \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \n v.  \n DIRECTOR, U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND \nIMMIGRATION SERVICES,  \n \nDefendant.   \n \n8:25CV59 \n \n \nMEMORANDUM \nAND ORDER \n  \nPlaintiff Harshkumar Patel (“Patel”) is an Indian national who has resided in the \nUnited States for several years.  Patel was the victim of an armed robbery in January 2024.  \nOn October 24, 2024, he filed an I- 918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (“I-918 \nPetition”) with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”).  See \nCaballero- Martinez v. Barr, 920 F.3d 543, 545 (8th Cir. 2019) (explaining a U Visa “is a \ntype of non-immigrant visa available to crime victims who assist law enforcement”); 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U)(i), 1184(p).  That day, Patel also filed a Form I-765 Application for Employment Authorization (“I-765 Form”). \nHe has since been waiting for a determination.  Patel filed suit (Filing No. 1) against \nthe Director of the USCIS (the “Director”)\n1 on February 10, 2025.  According to his pro se \ncomplaint,2 he has been “without a bona fide determination, work authorization, or \ndeferred action” for months following the submission of his I-918 Petition and I-765 Form.   \n \n1Angelica Alfonso-Royals is currently serving as the Acting Director of the USCIS.  \n2As other judges of this Court have recognized, Patel’s complaint is just one of over \none-hundred nearly-identical pro se  form complaints that have been filed in this Court in \nthe past few months.  See Monroy v. Director, USCIS, No. 8:25CV74, 2025 WL 1267767 \nat *1-*2 (D. Neb. May 1, 2025). 8:25-cv-00059-RFR-MDN     Doc # 18     Filed: 06/11/25     Page 1 of 8 - Page ID #\n<pageID>2 \n He asserts  that delay is unlawful and harmful.  Patel’s complaint  sets forth one cause \nof action under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 551 et seq., claiming \nthe circumstances surrounding USCIS’s failure to act in his case so far constitutes “unreasonably delay . . .  warrant[ing] mandamus” relief,  Telecomms. Rsch. and Action \nCtr. v. FCC, 750 F.2d 70, 79 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  He specifically asks the Court to order the \nUSCIS “to make bona fide determinations and decisions on the pending work authorization \napplications within 14 days.”  \nNow before the Court is the Director’s March 27, 2025, Motion to Dismiss (Filing \nNo. 5) Patel’s complaint for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  \nIn her facial attack on the Court’s jurisdiction, the Director argues the Court is barred  from \nconsidering Patel’s claim under  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  See Carlsen v. GameStop, \nInc., 833 F.3d 903, 908 (8th Cir. 2016) (explaining a court “ must distinguish between a \nfacial attack and a factual attack on jurisdiction” (quoting Osborn v. United States, 918 F.2d 724, 729 n.6 (8th Cir. 1990))) .  That subsection provides that “no court shall have \njurisdiction to review . . . any [] decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary \nof Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in”  \ntheir discretion.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  The Director avers the USCIS’s decisions \nconcerning Patel’s request for a bona fide determination (“BFD”) and employment authorization documents (“EAD”) —including over “the precise pace of adjudicating” \nthose requests—are discretionary and, thus , not subject to review.  \nOn May 1, 2025, Patel filed a belated response (Filing No. 8) opposing dismissal.  \nSee NECivR 7.1(b)(1)(B) (generally giving a party fourteen days to oppose a motion to \ndismiss).  Somewhat confusingly , and contrary to his complaint, Patel argues he only \nchallenges “BFD delays” not “BFD EAD delays.”  The Director  moved to strike (Filing \nNo. 9) his response a week later based on it being untimely and failing to include a requisite certificate of compliance.  See NECivR 7.1(d)(4) (requiring the author of a brief to certify \nthe number of words the brief contains and the role of any generative artificial intelligence 8:25-cv-00059-RFR-MDN     Doc # 18     Filed: 06/11/25     Page 2 of 8 - Page ID #\n<pageID>3 \n programs in its preparation), (5) (“Any brief not in compliance with this subsection may \nbe stricken, with or without further notice, in the sole discretion of the court.”).  Patel \nopposed that motion as well (Filing No. 13). \nThe Court held a hearing with the parties on May 22, 2025.  At that time, Patel \ninformed the Court —as he did in his brief opposing the government’s motion to strike—\nthat he did not receive a copy of the government’s motion to dismiss until the deadline for a response had passed.\n3  Based on Patel’s explanation, the Court informed the parties it \n \n3Patel’s explanation addressed other questions the Court had over the origins and \ncircumstances of these “pro se” filings.  As he explained, the form complaint utilized by \nPatel and over one-hundred other litigants was prepared and sold by Pro Se Pro, a company \nbased in Isle of Palms, South Carolina.  Some of the Court’s initial concern over these \nfilings came from the fact that those pleadings all provided the same address in Dover, \nDelaware, for the service of future filings despite the fact that each plaintiff provided their home address in their complaint.  Given what was discussed at the hearing, it seems the \nservice of documents to that address likely caused the plaintiffs’ delays in responding to \npending motions to dismiss. \n \nWhile those questions were answered, new ones arose.  To start, although the use of \nform complaints may be appropriate at times, so-called “ghostwriting” by an attorney  \nwithout attribution is a violation of Nebraska Rule of Professional Conduct § 3-501.2(c).  \nSee NEGenR 1.8(a) (adopting the Nebraska Rules of Professional Conduct “as the rules of \nthis court”).   That rule also applies to Pro Se Pro’s preparation of substantive responses to \nthe Director’s motions to dismiss.   \n \nOne of the apparent founding members of Pro Se Pro is an attorney who has \nappeared in this Court in similar cases.  And as an attorney admitted to practice in this  \nCourt, he is bound by the Nebraska Rules of Professional Conduct.  See id.; see also S.C. \nApp. Ct. R. 5.5(a) (“A lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction or assist another in doing so.”).  On \nthe other hand, if non-attorney employees of Pro Se Pro  have prepared the detailed \nresponses to the Rule 12(b)(1) motions filed in these cases, that practice would likely raise \nunauthorized-practice concerns.  See, e.g., Neb. Sup. Ct. R. § 3-1001 (defining the “practice \nof law” as “the application of legal principles and judgment with regard to the circumstances or objectives of another” including the “drafting . . . of legal documents \nwhich affect the legal rights” of a person). \n 8:25-cv-00059-RFR-MDN     Doc # 18     Filed: 06/11/25     Page 3 of 8 - Page ID #\n<pageID>4 \n intended to deny the Director’s motion to strike.  The Court further considered  both parties’  \narguments following the hearing.  \nIn ruling on the Director’s facial attack, “the court restricts itself to the face of the \npleadings, and the non- moving party receives the same protections as it would defending \nagainst a motion brought under Rule 12(b)(6).”  Carlsen, 833 F.3d at 908 (quoting Osborn , \n918 F.2d at 729 n.6).   That means the Court accepts all of the well-pleaded factual \nallegations in Patel’s complaint as true and only considers the information in the complaint, \n“materials that are ‘necessarily embraced by the pleadings[,]  and exhibits attached to the \ncomplaint’”  Id. (quoting Cox v. Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., 685 F.3d 663, 668 (8th \nCir. 2012)).  \n“The APA ’s right to judicial review ,” including in cases of unreasonable delays , \n“does not apply when ‘statutes preclude judicial review.’”  Thigulla v. Jaddou, 94 F.4th \n770, 774 (8th Cir. 2024) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1)).   As the Court has explained \nthoroughly in previous immigration-delay cases, “federal courts have an important role to \nplay under” the Immigration Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq., but \n“‘Congress has sharply circumscribed judicial review of the discretionary-relief process’  \nunder [8 U.S.C.] §§ 1182 and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).”  Boulay v. Jaddou, 700 F. Supp. 3d 753, \n757 (D. Neb. 2023) (quoting Patel v. Garland, 596 U.S. 328, 332 (2022)).  The \n“presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action” informs the proper \ninterpretation of those statutes.  Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 251 (2010)  (interpreting \nthe scope of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)).   Only where there is “‘clear and convincing \nevidence’ to dislodge the presumption” does the Court interpret the jurisdiction- stripping \nstatutes to bar judicial review of a claim under the APA.  Id. at 251-52. \n \nDespite its concerns, the Court will fully consider both parties’ briefs and rule on \nthe motion to dismiss based on those filings.   However, it advises the lay and lawyer \nmembers of Pro Se Pro  that they should heed the prohibitions of the Nebraska Rules of \nProfessional Conduct noted above.  8:25-cv-00059-RFR-MDN     Doc # 18     Filed: 06/11/25     Page 4 of 8 - Page ID #\n<pageID>5 \n The Court has applied these principles in finding it lacks jurisdiction  over claimed \ndelays in adjudicating I-601 Application s for Waivers of Grounds of Inadmissibility and I-\n601A Applications for Waivers  of Unlawful Presence.  See Boulay, 700 F. Supp. 3d at 755-\n58; Beltran v. Miller , 699 F. Supp. 3d 785, 791 -94 (D. Neb. 2023).  It has not always shared \nthe government’s at-times expansive view of the scope of the INA’s  jurisdiction-stripping \nprovisions.  See Boulay, 700 F. Supp. 3d at 757 (opining that “the word ‘judgment’ under \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)” could likely not “bear all the weight” the USCIS placed on it); Beltran, \n699 F. Supp. 3d at 793 (explaining how the government’s “broad interpretation of the \nstatutory language” in that case seemed  “to be a stretch”) .  But with respect to those \ndiscretionary forms of relief, it found certain provisions to be broad enough to encompass \nthe USCIS’s prioritization of certain applications for relief and decisions over how to \n“allocate its resources,” actions which affected the delays in those cases.  Beltran, 699 F. \nSupp. 3d at 793- 94; see also Chalamalesetty v. Jaddou, No. 4:22 -CV-3182, 2023 WL \n6387976, at *3 (D. Neb. Sept. 29, 2023) (concluding the USCIS’s “decision to do one thing, \nat a particular pace, instead of another thing is a discretionary decision insulated from \njudicial review”).  \nLooking at the statute that governs Patel’s claim, the same is true here.  See Kucana, \n558 U.S. at 237 (determining the words “specified under this subchapter” in § 1252(a)(2)(B) “ refer to statutory, but not to regulatory, specifications”); Rajasekaran v. \nHazuda, 815 F.3d 1095, 1099 (8th Cir. 2016) ( “If the statute specifies that the decision is \nwholly discretionary, regulations or agency practice will not make the decision \nreviewable.”  (quoting Abdelwahab v. Frazier , 578 F.3d 817, 821 n.6  (8th Cir.  2009))).  \nSection 1184(p)(6) provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security (the “Secretary”) \n“may grant work authorization to any alien who has a pending, bona fide application for \nnonimmigrant status under section 1101(a)(15)(U) of this title.”   That language stands in \nstark contrast to the mandatory “shall” associated with other duties of the government under the U-Visa program.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(3) (“[T]he Attorney General shall, \nduring the period those aliens are in lawful temporary resident status under that subsection, 8:25-cv-00059-RFR-MDN     Doc # 18     Filed: 06/11/25     Page 5 of 8 - Page ID #\n<pageID>6 \n provide the aliens with employment authorization.”), (4) (“In acting on any petition filed \nunder this subsection, the consular officer or the Attorney General, as appropriate, shall consider any credible evidence relevant to the petition.”) ; see also Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 430 (2009) (“ Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute \nbut omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” (quoting INS v. \nCardoza- Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 432 (1987)).  \nThe permissive language of § 1184(p)(6)—read in this context—makes clear that  \nthe decision to grant EADs to an individual with a pending I- 918 Petition is a matter \ngenerally committed to the Secretary’s discretion.  See Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, \n697 (2001) (explaining that “‘may’ suggests discretion” but not necessarily “unlimited discretion”); Thigulla, 94 F.4th at 775 (concluding the Attorney General was given \n“discretionary authority” since 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a) stated they “‘may’ adjust [one’s] status and ‘may’ prescribe regulations” in their discretion); see also Gonzalez v. Cuccinelli, 985 \nF.3d 357, 367-70 (4th Cir. 2021) (opining that the Secretary need not even implement the  \ntemporary work-authorization adjudications under § 1184(p)(6)).  The Court joins the other \njudges of this Court in reaching that conclusion.  See Barot v. Director, USCIS, No. \n8:25CV101, 2025 WL 1208968  at *2 (D. Neb. Apr. 25, 2025) (Gerrard, J.); Monroy, 2025 \nWL 1267767 at *8-9 (Buescher , J.); Reyes Olmos v. USCIS, No. 4:23C V3191, ___ F. Supp. \n3d ___, ___, 2025 WL 1582941  at *1-*2 (D. Neb. May 15, 2025) (Nelson, J.); Sonani v. \nDirector, USCIS, No. 8:25CV68 , 2025 WL 1489563 at *4-*5 (D. Neb. May 23, 2025) \n(Bataillon, J.).  \nPatel attempts to work around this patent discretion by asserting his complaints lie \nnot with delays to the adjudication of the EAD itself but with delays to the BFD  that \nprecedes it.  That’s tricky.  For one, the suggestion that Congress intended  for the first step \nof a wholly discretionary process to be nondiscretionary seems logically suspect.  Further, \n“[a]though the term ‘bona fide application’  appears in § 1184(p)(6), the statute does not 8:25-cv-00059-RFR-MDN     Doc # 18     Filed: 06/11/25     Page 6 of 8 - Page ID #\n<pageID>7 \n define ‘bona fide,’  ‘bona fide application,’  or otherwise dictate the process that the \nSecretary uses to determine whether to grant work authorization.”  Monroy, 2025 WL \n1267767 at *4; see also Barrios Garcia v. DHS, 25 F.4th 430, 443 (6th Cir. 2022) \n(observing that “the BFD process is not found in a regulation or a statute”) .  A reasonable \napplication of controlling authority guides that—under these circumstances—regulations  \nand agency policies may not carve out the discretion otherwise granted to the Secretary \nunder § 1184(p)(6) in implementing this EAD process.  See Rajasekaran, 815 F.3d at 1099; \ncf. Kucana, 558 U.S. at 237.  But cf. Barrios Garcia, 25 F.4th at 443 (finding § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not cover the “nonstatutory BFD process” and crediting the agency’s manual in finding the BFD EAD process to be nondiscretionary).  \nBecause § 1184(p)(6) gives the Secretary discretion over the EAD program for U-\nVisa applicants, the Court is barred by § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) from reviewing “decision or action” regarding that program.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   Stephen McCarthy, a physician assistant, had his Certificate of Registration (COR) revoked by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for prescribing controlled substances without required supervision from a physician. McCarthy contested the revocation, arguing that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) involved was unconstitutionally protected from removal and that the revocation was arbitrary and capricious. The court denied his petition, finding no substantial merit in his arguments and holding that McCarthy failed to demonstrate any link between the ALJ's removal protection and harm to him. Notably, McCarthy's defense relied on inaccurate AI-generated summaries of case law, which was addressed in court.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether the revocation of McCarthy's DEA registration by an ALJ, who was claimed to have unconstitutional removal protections, was arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion. Additionally, whether reliance on AI-generated, inaccurate legal summaries affected the proceedings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court upheld the DEA's decision to revoke McCarthy's COR, finding that McCarthy failed to establish any constitutional harm due to the ALJ's removal protections. The court also found that the DEA's decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious, as it was based on sufficient evidence of McCarthy's failure to comply with legal requirements for prescribing controlled substances. The AI-generated summaries McCarthy used to argue his case were dismissed as inaccurate and unreliable.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you're in school, and a teacher tells you that you can't play sports because you broke the rules by not having permission from your parents. You argue that the teacher can't be punished for their mistakes, and you say that other kids have gotten away with the same thing but later find out you got all that information from a computer program that made stuff up. The judges say, “Well, you didn't prove the teacher punished you wrongly, and using that fake info doesn't help, so the decision to stop you from playing stands.” This case was similar - McCarthy broke rules, tried to argue based on inaccurate information from an AI program, but the court stuck with the original decision to revoke his certification.",

Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 1      Date Filed: 07/21/2025 \n2 Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) revoking his Certificate of \nRegistration (COR) and denying any pending applications to modify or renew that COR.  He argues that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who recommended revocation was unconstitutionally protected from removal and that the ALJ’s decision adopted by the \nAdministrator was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion.  Because \nMcCarthy has failed to show the requisite link between any allegedly unconstitutional removal protections and his injury and because the revocation decision was neither arbitrary and capricious nor an abuse of discretion, we will deny the petition. \nI. BACKGROUND\n1 \n \nMcCarthy is a physician assistant who held a DEA COR allowing him to prescribe \nSchedule II through V controlled substances.  McCarthy prescribed controlled substances despite the fact that he was not being supervised by a physician with whom he had a \nwritten agreement as required by Pennsylvania law.  See 63 Pa. Stat. § 422.13(a), (e); 49 \nPa. Code § 18.152(a).  In response to his conduct, on April 21, 2023, the DEA issued McCarthy an Order to Show Cause why his continued registration was not inconsistent with the public interest. See  21 U.S.C. § 824.  Due to his apparent misconduct, the order \nproposed revoking McCarthy’s COR and denying any pending applications for modification or renewal of his registration.   \nOn August 31, 2023, a hearing was held before ALJ Paul E. Soeffing.  The DEA \npresented evidence that between August 24, 2022, and September 20, 2022, and again \n \n1 Because we write for the parties, we recite only the facts pertinent to our decision. Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 2      Date Filed: 07/21/2025 \n3 between October 6, 2022, and November 8, 2022, McCarthy issued approximately \nseventeen prescriptions for controlled substances while not covered by a written \nagreement.  McCarthy did not dispute this.  Instead, he argued that, during the time, he \nbelieved he was covered by a previous agreement with “Dr. F.”  Although that agreement \nwas inactivated in October of 2019 , McCarthy claimed that he believed this agreement \nwas still in place because he never received notice of its termination, because his lack of \ncommunication with Dr. F was not unusual so there was no reason to believe otherwise, and because the Pennsylvania Licensing System (PALS) did not show that the agreement \nwas inactive.  The ALJ rejected these arguments because McCarthy acknowledged that \nPALS was not always reliable and because the evidence indicated that the termination \nletter ending McCarthy ’s written agreement with Dr. F was provided to McCarthy, that \nMcCarthy and Dr. F were no longer employed by the same employer, that Dr. F and McCarthy spoke on only one occasion in 2019, and that McCarthy did not list Dr. F as \nthe supervising physician on the prescriptions he issued during the relevant time period.   \nThe ALJ concluded that the DEA had therefore proven its prima facie case that \nMcCarthy’s continued registration was inconsistent with the public interest.  \nAccordingly, the burden shifted to McCarthy to show that he could be entrusted with a \nCOR.  After considering McCarthy’s failure to unequivocally admit fault, his limited \nremedial action, the egregiousness of his conduct, and the need for deterrence, the ALJ \ndetermined that McCarthy had not met his burden and recommended that his COR be revoked and any pending applications for renewal or modification of his COR be denied.  \nThe Administrator of the DEA adopted the ALJ’s recommendation in its entirety and Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 3      Date Filed: 07/21/2025 \n4 ordered that McCarthy’s COR be revoked and any pending applications for renewal or \nmodification of his COR be denied.   \nMcCarthy timely petitioned for review.   \nII. DISCUSSION2 \n \nMcCarthy asks us to vacate the Administrator’s order asserting that the ALJ was \nunconstitutionally protected from removal and that the ALJ’s decision adopted by the \nAdministrator was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion.  We reject both arguments and will affirm.\n3 \n \n2  The DEA had jurisdiction pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §§ 823(g)(1) and 824(a) and 28 \nC.F.R. § 0.100(b).  We have jurisdiction pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 877.  We review \nquestions of constitutional law de novo.  Dinnall v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 247, 251 (3d Cir. \n2005).  “Agency decisions, such as the … Administrator’s Order, may be set aside only if \narbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law.”  \nHumphreys v. Drug Enf’t Admin., 96 F.3d 658, 660 (3d Cir. 1996) (citing 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A)).  Such agency decisions are entitled to “substantial deference” and “we must not simply substitute our judgment for that of the agency.”  Id. at 664.  Additionally, the \nagency’s findings of fact are “conclusive” “if supported by substantial evidence.”  21 U.S.C. § 877. \n3 McCarthy also raises an Appointments Clause challenge, asserting that the ALJ \nwas not appointed by the Attorney General as  he argues is required.  He did not raise this \nchallenge before the agency, and the parties dispute whether he can properly raise it now.  \nSee generally Carr v. Saul, 593 U.S. 83 (2021) (discussing issue exhaustion in \nadministrative adjudications and concluding that issue exhaustion did not apply to Appointments Clause challenges to the appointment of Social Security Administration \nALJs).  We assume without deciding that he can raise his Appointments Clause challenge now and reject it as factually incorrect.  Because this challenge was not raised before the \nagency, the initial record contained no information regarding who appointed the ALJ.  On \nappeal , the Government moved to supplement the record and provided a document \nshowing that the ALJ had been appointed by the Attorney General on December 1, 2020.  We now grant that motion, see Acumed LLC v. Advanced Surgical Servs., Inc., 561 F.3d \n199, 226 (3d Cir. 2009), and reject McCarthy’s Appointments Clause challenge, see  U.S. \nConst. art. II, § 2, cl. 2. Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 4      Date Filed: 07/21/2025 \n5 A. Removal Protections Challenge \n \nDEA ALJs are removable by the Attorney General “only for good cause \nestablished and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 7521(a).4  Members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, in turn, are removable by \nthe President, but “only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”  5 U.S.C. § 1202(d).  McCarthy argues, and the Government now concedes, that this structure amounts to unconstitutional “multilevel protection from removal” under Free \nEnter. Fund v. Pub . Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 484 (2010).  Of course, the \nGovernment’s concession does not govern our analysis.  Cf. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. \n(1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803).  Nonetheless, we need not resolve this thorny issue here because McCarthy cannot bring his removal-protection challenge. \nIn order to bring a re\n moval-protection challenge, a litigant “must show that the \nconstitutional infirmity actually caused harm.”  NLRB v. Starbucks Corp., 125 F.4th 78, \n88 (3d Cir. 2024) (petitioner failed to link removal-protection infirmity to an actual harm and therefore could not bring challenge); see also CFPB v. Nat’l Collegiate Master \nStudent Loan Tr., 96 F.4th 599, 607 (3d Cir. 2024) (“[A]ctions taken by an improperly \ninsulated director are not ‘void’ and do not need to be ‘ratified’ unless a plaintiff can show that the removal provision harmed him.” (quoting Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, \n259 (2021))).  Stated differently, a litigant must show a causal “link” between the \n \n4 “Section 7521 applies to any ALJs appointed under 5 U.S.C. § 3105.  DEA ALJs \nare appointed under 5 U.S.C. § 3105 pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 556(b)(3) and 21 C.F.R. \n§ 1316.42(f).”  Rabadi v. Drug Enf’t Admin, 122 F.4th 371, 375 n.5 (9th Cir. 2024). Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 5      Date Filed: 07/21/2025 \n6 asserted removal-protection-infirmity and an actual harm.  Nat’l Collegiate, 96 F.4th at \n615; see Starbucks Corp., 125 F.4th at 88–89.  McCarthy argues that the revocation of his \nCOR is a greater injury than the injury at issue in Starbucks, but he fails to address the \nrequisite causal link.  McCarthy does not show, or even argue, that his injury would have \nbeen lessened or eliminated if the ALJ did not have unconstitutional removal protections.  \nAccordingly, his removal-protection challenge fails.  See  Starbucks, 125 F.4th at 88; \nNat’l Collegiate, 96 F.4th at 615. \nB. Arbitrary and Capricious Challenge \n \nMcCarthy next argues that the Administrator’s decision to revoke his COR was \narbitrary and capricious or an abuse of discretion.  See  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  He \nconcedes that the “Administrator’s choice of sanction ‘is entitled to substantial \ndeference’” and that “[o]rdinarily, the mere unevenness in the application of a sanction \nwill not render its application in a particular case ‘unwarranted in law.’”  Opening Br. 25 (quoting Chein v. Drug Enf’t Admin., 533 F.3d 828, 835 (D.C. Cir. 2008)); see also Butz \nv. Glover Livestock Comm’n Co., 411 U.S. 182, 187 (1973).  Nonetheless, relying on \nD.C. Circuit case law, he contends that an agency abuses its discretion if the penalty it imposes is an unrecognized or unexplained “flagrant departure” from past practice and that the DEA’s actions here were such a departure.  Chein, 533 F.3d at 835 (quoting \nMorall v. Drug Enf’ t Admin., 412 F.3d 165, 183 (D.C. Cir. 2005)).  This standard seems \nto just be an application of the principle that agencies must “generally ‘display awareness’ of a change in [agency] position.”  N.J. Bd. of Pub. Utils. v. FERC, 744 F.3d Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 6      Date Filed: 07/21/2025 \n7 74, 104 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 5 56 U.S. 502, 515 \n(2009)).  \nTo make this point, McCarthy primarily relies on “summaries” of eight DEA \nadjudications.  McCarthy’s counsel now acknowledges that seven of these summaries \nwere inaccurate, that the eighth decision does not exist, and that the summaries and non-\nexistent decision were all generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI).  McCarthy’s counsel further acknowledges that he never took care to confirm the accuracy of the summaries or even that the decisions existed.\n5  Accordingly, we will not consider this portion of his \nbrief.6  Cf. Grant v. City of Long Beach, 96 F.4th 1255 (9th Cir. 2024) (striking brief and \ndismissing appeal for a similar issue).  \nMcCarthy cites two additional cases but neither supports his position.  In one case, \nthe DEA i\nmposed a sanction short of revocation because the respondent accepted \nresponsibility for her actions.  See  Jayam Krishna-Iyer, M.D., 74 Fed. Reg. 459, 463 \n(DEA Jan. 6, 2009).  Krishna-Iyer thus sits neatly in DEA’s framework where a sanction \n \n5 We ordered McCarthy’s counsel to provide the cases to the Court and explain if \nand how he verified the accuracy of his summaries.  In his response, McCarthy’s counsel \nacknowledged that he knew that he had submitted erroneous summaries and a non-existent case to this Court long before the filing of his response.  We are separately \nordering McCarthy’s counsel to show cause why he should not be sanctioned for his conduct, particularly for his lack of candor to the Court. \n6 McCarthy’s counsel also concedes that the Government has successfully rebutted \nthe eight summaries.  This provides us with another reason not to consider this portion of \nthe brief.  See  United States v. Batista, 483 F.3d 193, 199 n.4 (3d Cir. 2007) (noting that \nan argument was waived because it was conceded). Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 7      Date Filed: 07/21/2025 \n8 short of revocation can be imposed if a respondent accepts responsibility.7  But here the \nAdministrator found that McCarthy only partially accepted responsibility and that finding \nwas supported by substantial evidence due to, among other things, his attempts to justify his conduct and shift the blame to other parties.  Therefore, Krishna-Iyer does not reflect \nthat revocation of McCarthy’s COR was a flagrant departure from DEA practice. \nIn the other case, the DEA revoked the registrant’s COR, in part  because she failed \nto fully take responsibility for her actions, and the D.C. Circuit denied the petition for review.  See  St. Croix v. Drug Enf’t Admin., No. 21-1116, 2022 WL 2092177, at **1–2 \n(D.C. Cir. June 10, 2022) (per curiam).  This is consistent with the DEA’s treatment of McCarthy’s case, wherein he was found to only partially accept responsibility for his conduct.  McCarthy argues nonetheless that his behavior was less egregious than the \nconduct in St. Croix.  Assuming that is true, it only shows the range of conduct that DEA \ndetermines to be inconsistent with the public interest and justifying a revocation, not that revocation here is a flagrant departure from DEA practice. \nMcCarthy briefly makes a few additional arguments that all lack merit.  McCarthy \nargues that the Administrator failed to acknowledge the ways in which McCarthy did take responsibility.  The Administrator did consider McCarthy’s limited acceptance of responsibility, she just found it lacking.   \n \n7 McCarthy concedes that the DEA may look to the registrant’s acceptance of \nresponsibility in determining if continued registration is consistent with the public \ninterest.  Some DEA cases regarding the acceptance of responsibility focus on the fact \nthat the violation was intentional or knowing.   Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 8      Date Filed: 07/21/2025 \n9 McCarthy also argues that his punishment should not have been as severe because \nthe violations were “based on [his] misunderstanding” that he was still being supervised \nby Dr. F.  Opening Br. 29.  The Administrator considered this argument and determined that McCarthy’s asserted belief was not “reasonable,” App. 168.  This conclusion was \nsupported by substantial evidence as the Administrator explained that any \nmisunderstanding could have been avoided with “basic due diligence” and “proper and \nongoing communication” between McCarthy and his former supervising physician, App. 173.  In any case, under DEA precedent, unintentional misconduct can justify revoking a COR.  See  Fares Jeries Rabadi, M.D., 87 Fed. Reg. 30,564, 30,603 n.35 (DEA May 19, \n2022), petition for rev. denied, 122 F.4th 371 (9th Cir. 2024).  \nMcCarthy next argues that his COR should not have been revoked because the \nDEA failed \nto show that his misconduct resulted in the diversion of any prescribed drugs \nor in harm to any patients.  The Administrator considered this argument, and its rejection of this argument was not an abuse of discretion.  Agency precedent is clear that the DEA can find that continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest, even when a harm has not yet been realized.  See  Melanie Baker N.P., 86 Fed. Reg. 23,998, 24,009 \n(DEA May 5, 2021). \nMcCarthy next claims that revoking his “COR is not in the public interest insofar \nas he provi\ndes critical, specialized psychiatric care which is not easily replaceable.”  \nOpening Br. 31.  Again, the Administrator considered and rejected this argument consistent with DEA policy and practice.  See Brenton D. Wynn, M.D., 87 Fed. Reg. \n24,228, 24,258 n.KK (DEA Apr. 22, 2022).  In short, the Administrator considered and Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 9      Date Filed: 07/21/2025 \n10 rejected all of McCarthy’s mitigation arguments, and McCarthy fails to show how \nrejecting these arguments was arbitrary and capricious.  See Humphreys, 96 F.3d at 662–\n64 (holding Deputy Administrator’s decision arbitrary and capricious where he “fail[ed] to discuss the one and only defense raised by Humphreys” and explaining that “this is not \nsimply a case where we disagree with the Deputy Administrator’s application of relevant \nmitigating aspects of the statutory factors to settled facts”). \nFinally, McCarthy argues that the Administrator failed to consider sanctions less \ndrastic than revocation, such as a suspension of his COR or reprimand.  That is simply not true.  The Administrator considered lesser punishments but ultimately concluded that revocation was appropriate because McCarthy failed to show he could be trusted with a COR.\n8   \nIII. CONCLUSION \n \nFor the forgoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review. \n \n8 McCarthy raises three additional arguments that are all forfeited.  One is forfeited \nbecause it was raised in a footnote.  John Wyeth & Bro. Ltd. v. CIGNA Int’l Corp., 119 \nF.3d 1070, 1076 (3d Cir. 1997).  The others are  forfeited because they were raised for the \nfirst time in a reply brief.  Hoxworth v. Blinder, Robinson & Co., 903 F.2d 186, 204 n.29 \n(3d Cir. 1990). \n Case: 24-2704     Document: 52     Page: 10      Date Filed: 07/21/2025",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico granted a motion for reconsideration after previously dismissing the Plaintiffs' claims due to a perceived lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the IDEA. The Court recognized that recent Supreme Court precedent, Luna Perez v. Sturgis Public Schools, clarified that Plaintiffs are not required to exhaust administrative remedies for claims seeking compensatory damages. The initial motion to dismiss filed by Defendants was critically questioned by the court, suspecting it could have been drafted by either artificial intelligence or an attorney with insufficient understanding, due to its poor quality and misapprehension of procedural rules.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether administrative exhaustion under the IDEA is necessary for claims seeking compensatory damages and whether the initial dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was correct.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that claims for compensatory damages do not require administrative exhaustion under the IDEA, based on the recent Supreme Court decision in Luna Perez. It also found that Plaintiffs did not have fair notice that their complaint could be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6), given the inadequate argumentation from Defendants' motion.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone (the Plaintiffs) was told they couldn't complain about how their child with special needs was treated at school because they hadn’t followed some paperwork rules first. But then, a big new rule (from the Supreme Court) said they didn't have to follow those rules for some types of complaints, like if they were just asking for money because of the harm caused. Also, when the school tried to get their complaint thrown out, they did such a bad job explaining why that the court thought maybe a robot or somebody who doesn't know what they’re doing wrote their request. Because of this, the court decided to give the family another chance to make their case.",

Case 3:22-cv-01419-MAJ     Document 146     Filed 01/24/25     Page 1 of 9On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an Order to Show  Cause to Plaintiffs  \nreasoning that, because the Court had previously dismissed  Plaintiffs ’ Third -Party \nComplaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies , it would be “ prudent to confirm \nthe subject -matter jurisdiction for Plaintiffs ’ primary action .” (ECF No. 115 ). \nSpecifically, the Order directed Plaintiffs to show “why this action should not be dismissed \nfor lack of subject matter  jurisdiction due to the non -exhaustion of administrative \nremedies under the IDEA or why such exhaustion is not necessary in this case.” Id.  \nThe very  same day, Defendants filed a motion titled “Motion to Dismiss/Lack of \nJurisdiction as to All Defendants.”  (ECF No. 116 ). As the Court noted in its previous \norder, that Motion left “much to be desired by way of argumentation[.]” ( ECF No. 139 \nat 22 ). Indeed, the Motion appeared to conflate Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure, argued for dismissal “for lack of federal jurisdiction[,]” and cited \nto Rule 12(b)(6) as the governing standard. ( ECF No. 116 at 1 ).1 In their Response to the \nOrder to Show Cause, Plaintiffs argued  that the Court had subject matter jurisdiction \nbecause Plaintiffs’ claims did not fall within the ambit of the IDEA and Plaintiffs \naccordingly were not required to exhaust administrative remedies. (ECF  119).  \nIn a subsequent Opinion and Order, the Court ordered dismissal of Plaintiffs’ \nComplaint and dismissed the action in its entirety. ( ECF 139 ); (ECF 140 ).  T he Court \nreached that decision on the ground that Plaintiffs ’ failure to exhaust administrative \nremedies deprived the Court of subject matter jurisdiction to entertain their claims. ( ECF \n139). In addition, the Court found in dicta that, even if the Court did have subject matter \n \n1 The Motion , which was filed mere hours after the Court issued its Order to Show Cause, (ECF 115 ), \nprovided no substantive analysis of the facts of the case and consisted solely of legal boilerplate. Troublingly , \nthe Motion is composed of such fundamental misapprehen sions  of fact and law  that the Court is forced to \nspeculate whether it was composed either by artificial intelligence or by an attorney with an alarming lack \nof capacity. See also infra  Section IV.B.  Case 3:22-cv-01419-MAJ     Document 146     Filed 01/24/25     Page 2 of 9jurisdiction over Plaintiffs claims, P laintiffs had failed to state a claim for which relief \ncould be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On \nSeptember 20, 2024, Plaintiffs filed the instant Motion for Reconsideration. (ECF No. \n141).  \nIII. Standard of Review  \nGranting  a motion for reconsideration under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis \"an extraordinary remedy which should be used sparingly.\" Palmer v. Champion \nMortg ., 465 F.3d 24, 30 (1st Cir. 2006) . Courts have discretion to grant such motions only \nif the moving party demonstrates (1) a manifest error of law or fact, (2) newly discovered \nevidence, or (3) a significant intervening change in the law. FDIC v. Mapfre Praico Ins. \nCo. of P.R. , 638 F. Supp. 3d 102, 106 –07 (D.P.R. 2022).  “Unless the court has \nmisapprehended some material fact or point of law, such a motion is normally not a \npromising vehicle for revisiting a party ’s case and rearguing theories previously advanced \nand rejected.” Id. (citing In re Sun Pipe Line Co ., 831 F.2d 22, 24 –25 (1st Cir. 1987)).    \nIV. Analysis  \nAfter careful consideration of the Opinion and Order dismissing this action in its \nentirety, the Court finds that the Order  was premised on a  manifest  error of law. First, a s \nPlaintiffs argue forcefully in their Motion for Reconsideration, recent precedent from the \nUnited States Supreme Court establishes that Plaintiffs were not required to exhaust \nadministrative remedies with respect to all of their claims. Luna Perez v. Stu rgis Pub. \nSch. , 598 U.S. 142 (2023) . Second , the Court finds merit in Plaintiffs ’ contention that they \nwere  not sufficiently on notice that their Complaint would be scrutinized under Rule \n12(b)(6)  and therefore  dismissal of their action for failure to stat e a claim was premature \nabsent additional briefing from the parties. The Court will address each issue in turn.  Case 3:22-cv-01419-MAJ     Document 146     Filed 01/24/25     Page 3 of 9A. Subject Matter Jurisdiction  \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”  or “the Act” ) “provides \nfederal funds to assist states in educating children with disabilities [,] and conditions such \nfunding upon a State ’s compliance with extensive goals and procedures.” Roe v. Healey , \n78 F.4th 11, 15 –16 (1st Cir. 2023) (cleaned up)  (noting that, t o receive such funding, states \nmust guarantee to all children with disabilities a free and appropriate public education , \ncommonly referred to as a “FAPE ”). Parties must exhaust state -based  administrative \nremedies before filing a lawsuit in federal court alle ging violations of the IDEA. Id. \nGenerally, w here a party fails to exhaust administrative remedies as to a claim for relief \navailable under the IDEA, that  failure  deprives federal court s of jurisdiction to entertain \nthe claim. See Valentín -Marrero v. Puerto Rico , 29 F.4th 45, 53 n.4 (1st Cir. 2022) ; 20 \nU.S.C.  § 1415(l)  (before  filing a civil action under other federal laws “seeking relief that is \nalso available” under IDEA, “the procedures under [§ 1415](f) and (g) shall be \nexhausted.”).  \nOnly certain remedies are available to redress violations of the IDEA. The Act does \nnot pr ovide for compensatory damages, and § 1415(l) specifically instructs  that “[n]othing \n[in the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict” the ability of parties to seek “remedies” under \n“other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities.” The  Act’s \nadministrative exhaustion requirement is therefore not applicable to claims for \ncompensatory damages. See Luna Perez v. Sturgis Pub. Sch. , 598 U.S. 142, 147 (2023).  \nIn Fry v. Napolean Community Schools , the Supreme Court  held that, when \ndetermining whether a plaintiff’s claim falls within the ambit of the IDEA’s administrative \nexhaustion requirement, “a court should look to the substance, or gravamen, of the \nplaintiff’s complaint.”  580 U.S. 154, 165 (2017). In a footnote to that sentence, the Case 3:22-cv-01419-MAJ     Document 146     Filed 01/24/25     Page 4 of 9Supreme Court suggested  that the statute left ambiguous whether a plaintiff seeking \ncompensatory damages for harms that relate to the substantive requirements of the IDEA \nmust exhaust administrative remedies as to that claim for relie f: \nIn reaching these conclusions, we leave for another day a further question about \nthe meaning of § 1415(l): Is exhaustion required when the plaintiff complains of \nthe denial of a FAPE, but the specific remedy she requests —here, money damages \nfor emotiona l distress —is not one that an IDEA hearing officer may award?  \n \nId. at 165 n.4.  Six years later, in Luna Perez , the  Supreme  Court settled th e matter . \nExpressly referring to the question presented in note 4 of Fry as “the question we now \nface[,]” i.e. whether a plaintiff must exhaust administrative processes under the IDEA \nwhere they seek money damages for emotional distress arising from denial of a FAPE , “we \nansw er in the negative.” Luna Perez , 598 U.S. at 149–150. Thus, taking  Fry and Luna \nPerez  together, the central question is  whether the remedies sought by a plaintiff  are \nremedies that the IDEA provides. Where the remedies sought by a plaintiff are not \navailab le under the Act , administrative remedies need not be exhausted; accordingly, if a \nplaintiff brings a claim for backwards -looking monetary damages, it is immaterial  \nwhether the underlying harm involved the denial of FAPE.2 As noted above, \n \n2  This analysis does not disturb the Court’s Opinion and Order at ECF No. 114, where the Court \ndismissed the Plaintiffs’ Third -Party Complaint against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico \n(“Commonwealth”) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. After Defendants had filed a Counterclaim \nagainst Plaintiffs  for allegedly unpaid tuition, ECF No. 54, Plaintiffs filed a Third -Party Complaint against \nthe Commonwealth, alleging that the Commonwealth was obligated to indemnify Plaintiffs for any such \nunpaid tuition. ( ECF No. 77 ); (ECF No. 84 ). In the Opinion and O rder dismissing the Third -Party \nComplaint, the Court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the third -party claim because \nPlaintiffs had failed to previously exhaust their administrative remedies. (ECF No. 114 ). Repayment for \npreviously unpai d educational tuition is an equitable remedy provided by the IDEA. Forest Grove Sch. Dist. \nv. T.A. , 557 U.S. 230, 247 (2009) (concluding that the “IDEA authorizes reimbursement for the cost of \nprivate special -education services when a school district fails  to provide a FAPE and the private -school \nplacement is appropriate, regardless of whether the child previously received special education or related \nservices through the public school.”). As noted above, under  First Circuit precedent, Plaintiffs failure to  \nexhaust administrative remedies forms a categorical bar to the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over the \nThird -Party Claim. See Valentín -Marrero , 29 F.4th at  53 n.4 (noting that, under First Circuit precedent, \nwhere a party fails to previously exhaust administrative remedies as to a claim for relief available under the \nIDEA, that failure deprives a federal court of jurisdiction to entertain the claim).  Case 3:22-cv-01419-MAJ     Document 146     Filed 01/24/25     Page 5 of 9administrative exhaustion requirement is therefore not applicable to claims for \ncompensatory damages. See Luna Perez , 598 U.S. at 147.  \nIn the instant action, there is no doubt that Plaintiffs have stated a claim for \nbackward -looking compe nsatory damages. ( ECF No. 141 at 7 –12). Unlike a claim for \ncompensatory education, a form of relief that is available under the IDEA and consists  of \n“future special education and related services to ensure or remedy a past denial of a \nFAPE[,]” Doucette v. Georgetown Pub. Schs. , 936 F.3d 16, 32 (1st Cir. 2019), Plaintiffs ’ \nclaim for monetary relief seeks backward -looking compensation for past physical and \nemotional harms allegedly inflicted on D.A.L.P. See Roe v. Healey , 78 F.4th at 16 \n(“Reimbursement of educational expenses is limited to money spent by parents for \neducatio n-related expenditures that the state ought to have borne . Such reimbursements \nare distinct from damages.”)  (citations and quotations omitted) . Under Luna -Perez , those \nclaims need not be administratively exhausted. The Court therefore may properly exercise  \nsubject matter jurisdiction over all claims for compensatory damages brought by \nPlaintiffs.  \nThis remains true even where , as here,  a complaint commingles equitable and legal \nclaims for relief. In short, where a complaint sets forth allegations regarding the denial of \nFAPE and requests both equitable relief and compensatory damages, and all such  claims \nwere not administratively exhausted, the latter claims may survive a motion to dismiss \neven as the former claims are subject to dismissal. Luna  Perez , which  focuses our \nattention on “remedies”  rather than on “controversies,”  requires that exhaustion be \nanalyzed in this way on a claim -by-claim basis.  Indeed, other courts applying Luna  Perez  \nhave taken this approach to distinguishing equitable and legal claims for relief under the \nIDEA’s administrative exhaustion requirements . See Li v. Revere Loc. Sch. Dist. , No. 21 -Case 3:22-cv-01419-MAJ     Document 146     Filed 01/24/25     Page 6 of 93422, 2023 WL 3302062, at *13 (6th Cir. May 8, 2023)  (characterizing one count as a \nclaim for equitable relief and dismissing for failure to  exhaust administrative remedies, \nwhile  finding that  another count,  a claim for backward -looking compensatory damages \nbrought under § 1983, was not subject to dismissal on those grounds); see also Doe v. \nFranklin Square Union Free Sch. Dist. , 100 F.4th 86,  102 n.9 (2d Cir. 2024) ( Claims for \ncompensatory damages are not subject to administrative exhaustion requirements simply \nbecause a plaintiff “sought equitable relief at one point during the litigatio n[.] [W] here, \nas here, a plaintiff seeks both damages an d equitable relief, the failure to exhaust remedies \nunder the IDEA bars (or defers) only the equitable relief portion of the suit, not the \ndamages portion as well.”) ; cf. Doe v. Gavins , No. 22 -CV-10702 -ADB, 2023 WL 6296398, \nat *13 –14 (D. Mass. Sept. 27, 2023) (“ If it becomes clear as the case progresses that they \ndo in fact seek equitable remedies, such as educational reimbursement, in addition to or \ninstead of compensatory damages, the Court will re -evaluate whether exhaustion is \nrequired.”). Therefore,  all claims for equitable relief brought by Plaintiffs – including for \ncompensatory education – remain properly dismissed for failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies.  \nB. Failure to State a Claim for Which Relief May be Granted  \n \nIn the prior Opinion and Order,  (ECF No. 139 ), the Court reasoned that, even if \nit could  properly  exercise subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims, Plaintiffs had \nfailed to state a claim for which relief could be granted under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure. In the instant Motion for Reconsideration, (ECF No. 141 ), \nPlaintiff s argue that because of the serious deficiencies that characterized the Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss, they were  not properly on notice that their  claims were subject to \ndismissal on these grounds . (ECF No. 116 ). After careful consideration, the Co urt agrees.  Case 3:22-cv-01419-MAJ     Document 146     Filed 01/24/25     Page 7 of 9Before a Court may dismiss a claim  sua sponte , the parties must be on notice of \narguable deficiencies in the complaint and they must have an opportunity to amend or \notherwise respond. See Chute v. Walker , 281 F.3d 314, 318 –320 (1st Cir. 2002) (sua \nsponte dismissals under 12(b)(6) are appropriate in limited circumstances, but sua sponte \ndismissal was erroneous when plaintiff was not afforded notice and opportunity to amend \ncomplaint or otherwise respond ). Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss on the same \nday as the Court’s Order to Show Cause “as to why this action should not be dismissed for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the non -exhaustion of administrative remedies ,” \nand explicitly noted t hat the motion was based on the Court’s Order to Show Cause at ECF \nNo. 115.  (ECF No. 116  at 1 ). The motion did not develop any arguments about the \nsufficiency of the allegations set forth in the Operative Complaint. ( ECF No. 116 ). Rather, \nthe Motion appear ed to conflate Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, argued for dismissal “for lack of federal jurisdiction[,]” and cited to Rule \n12(b)(6) as the governing standard. ( ECF No. 116 at 1 ). Although Defendants ’ Motion to \nDismiss made general reference  to Rule 12(b)(6)  of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , \nit ran afoul of Rule 7(b)(1)(B) by failing to “state with particularity the grounds for seeking \nthe order” to dismiss for failure to state a claim , and provided no actual analysis of the \nallegations in the Operative Complaint under the Rule 12(b)(6) standard. Thus, in order \nto respond to the request for dismissal raised by Defendants ’ Motion, Plaintiffs were put \nin an untenable position of having to antic ipate arguments for dismissal that were never \nactually raised against  them . Thus, Plaintiffs were not on meaningful notice and did not \nhave a genuine opportunity to respond before the Court dismissed the matter under Rule \n12(b)(6).  \n Case 3:22-cv-01419-MAJ     Document 146     Filed 01/24/25     Page 8 of 9V. Conclusion  \n For the fo regoing reasons, the Court finds  that reconsideration is warranted. \nPlaintiffs Motion to Reconsider is GRANTED  as to Plaintiffs ’ claims for compensatory \ndamages.  Plaintiffs are hereby ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE  why, in light of  the reasons \nset forth at ECF No . 139 at Section IV. b, the Operative Complaint should not be dismissed \nunder Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted. Response \ndue by February 14, 2025.  \n IT IS SO ORDERED.  \n In San Juan, Pue rto Rico, this 24th day of January , 2025.  \n/s/ María Antongiorgi -Jordán   \nMARIA ANTONGIORGI -JORDAN   \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE   \n Case 3:22-cv-01419-MAJ     Document 146     Filed 01/24/25     Page 9 of 9",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves a dispute between Rebecca Brzeg and National Indoor RV Center, LLC (NIRVC) where the court granted motions allowing defense attorneys to withdraw their appearances and ordered them to pay plaintiff's attorney fees due to misconduct. The attorneys, representing NIRVC from the firm Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani, acted without proper authority in settlement negotiations and consistently disregarded court orders.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue in this case is whether the defendant's attorneys, Kelly V. Milam and Morgan C. Klutho, acted in bad faith and without proper authority in their conduct during settlement negotiations, and whether this misconduct warranted the imposition of sanctions and attorney fees.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the attorneys from Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani engaged in willful misconduct by ignoring court orders and negotiating settlements without client authority, thereby abusing the judicial process. As a result, the court granted the plaintiff's request for attorney's fees, totaling $15,610, to be paid by the attorneys' firm.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you are playing a board game, and someone keeps breaking the rules because they're not paying attention. Then, they try to make a deal that they're not allowed to make because they didn't ask their teammate first. The referee (judge) sees all this and decides that the player who broke the rules should pay a penalty (attorney fees) to the other team for wasting their time. The judge also lets the player leave the game (withdraw their attorney status) because they weren't following the rules anyway.",

Milam and Morgan C. Klutho, then counsel for Defendant, \nNational Indoor RV Centers, LLC  (\"NIRVC \") (Filing No. 67; Filing No. 75 ) and Plaintiff  Rebecca \nBrzeg 's (\"Brzeg \") Motion for Attorney's Fees  (Filing No. 121 ). The Court orally granted the \nmotions. ( Filing No. 131 ). In this Order, the Court issues its  findings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw, which support granting each of the motions.   \nI.  DISCUSSION  \nA. Motions to Withdraw  \nOn September  8 and September 12,  2025, c ounsels Kelly Milam ( \"Milam\" ) and Morgan \nKlutho ( \"Klutho\" ) with the firm Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani ( \"GRSM \") move d to withdraw \ntheir appearances on behalf NIRVC, asserting that \" NIRVC terminated GRSM 's representation of \nit as a party on September 2, 2025.\" ( Filing No. 75 ). NIRVC stated at the final pretrial conference \non October 29, 2025, that it withdrew its previous opposition to the motion and now has no \nobjection to the Court granting Milam's and Klutho's withdraw als. Accordingly, the Motions to Case 1:24-cv-00491-TWP-CSW     Document 132     Filed 10/31/25     Page 1 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n Withdraw were orally granted  at the October 29, 2025 pretrial conference, and t he appearances \nof attorneys Kelly Milam and Morgan Klutho are withdrawn .  \nB. Plaintiff 's Motion For Attorneys'  Fees  \nOn October 23, 2025, Brzeg moved the Court to award reasonable attorneys ' fees for her \ncounsel's hours and fees reasonably expended in litigating the Motion to Enforce Settlement and \nSettlement Agreement (Filing No. 62 ), including the  motion requesting an award of attorneys ' fees \n(Filing No. 121 ). While Brzeg  asks that Defendant NIRVC pay $15,610.00 in its reasonable \nattorneys' fees to Plaintiff 's counsel for litigating the Motion to Enforce  Settlement, the Court \ndetermines that the fees should be paid by NIRVC 's former counsel, Milam and Klutho, and their  \nfirm, Gordon Rees Scully Mansukhani.  \nIn Defendant 's Brief i n Opposition t o Plaintiff 's Motion f or Attorneys ' Fees, NIRVC argue s \nthe Court should not award attorneys'  fee to Brzeg  because t he facts here do not support the \nsanction of an attorneys ' fee award  (Filing No. 124 at 2 –3). The Court is not persuaded. The district \ncourt \" has inherent authority to manage judicial proceedings and to regulate the conduct of those \nappearing before it, and pursuant to that authority may impose appropriate sanctions to penalize \nand discourage misconduct.\" Ramirez v. T&H Lemont, Inc., 845 F.3d 772, 776 (7th Cir. 2016) \n(citing Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 46–50 (1991)). Sanctions imposed pursuant to the court's inherent authority must be premised on a finding that the culpable party willfully abused the judicial process or otherwise conducted the litigation in bad faith. Id.  \nThe record in this case shows that GRSM 's attorneys  willfully abused the judicial process \nand conducted the litigation in bad faith by not focusing efforts on this case, repeatedly \ndisregard ing Court orders, and then attempting to settle the case with no authority  to do so. Case 1:24-cv-00491-TWP-CSW     Document 132     Filed 10/31/25     Page 2 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n 1. GRSM 's Lack of Focus and Disregard of Court Orders  \nMilam appeared on behalf of NIRVC on November 13, 2024 ( Filing No. 25 ). On January \n13, 2025, the Magistrate Judge set a settlement conference for April 17, 2025 ( Filing No. 33 ). The \nOrder detailed  required deadlines and procedures relating to the settlement conference and put \nGRSM on notice that failure to comply with any of the Order 's provisions may result in sanctions. \nId. at 4. On March 7, 2025, Milam failed to appear for a telephonic status conference, and was \nordered to show cause for her  failure to appear ( Filing No. 36 ). In her Response to Order to Show \nGood Cause  (Filing No. 37 ), filed on March 15, 2025, Milam admitted that her failure to appear  \nwas \"embarrassing \" and apologized, but within weeks , she disregarded additional Court orders and \nprocedures.  \nOn April 16, 2025, the Magistrate Judge  ordered Milam and Klutho to show cause a second \ntime to address their efforts in this case ( Filing No. 43 ). Among other things, NIRVC  had not yet \nresponded to Brzeg's  settlement demand, despite being ordered to do so twice ( Filing No. 33 ; \nFiling No. 35 ) and despite a March 15, 2025 email from defense counsel stating that they would \nsend an update d counteroffer \"shortly\" ( Filing No. 43 at 2 ). Moreover, on April 15, 2025, per Court \norder, the  parties jointly reported their readiness for the settlement conference and that NIRVC \nintended to begin the settlement conference with a monetary offer. Id. Less than two hours later, \ndefense counsel sent an ex parte  communication to the Court that NIRVC would not be making a \nmonetary offer. Id.  Following these incidents, t he Magistrate Judge again put GRSM on notice that \nsanctions may be considered for \" inaccurate and misleading representations and for violations of \nthis Court 's previous orders \" and ordered lead defense counsel , Milam,  to attend the settlement \nconference in  person with NIRVC. Id.  at 2–3. Case 1:24-cv-00491-TWP-CSW     Document 132     Filed 10/31/25     Page 3 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n As the Magistrate Judge made clear, a settlement conference should be the culmination of \nmonths of focused efforts ( Filing No. 43 ). Milam undoubtedly did not focus her efforts in advance \nof the settlement conference.1 Klutho entered  her appearance on April 10, 2025, just one week \nbefore the settlement conference ( Filing No. 41 ). On April 17, 2025, Klutho  appeared in person \nfor the settlement conference—but in violation of the Court's order , Milam did not.  \nOn April 24, 2025, the Court issued another Order to Show Cause addressing counsel 's \nlack of preparation, inattention to settlement offers, and disregard of Court orders, including \nMilam's failure to attend the settlement conference on April 17, 2025 ( Filing No. 46 ). Not only did \nMilam disregard the order to appear, but she also failed to  notify the Court that she would be unable \nto appear  or request that her absence be excused . Id. As a result of Milam's failure to comply with \nCourt orders and lack of sufficient good cause  in her Response to Show Cause  (Filing No. 45 ), the \nCourt required Milam to file a verification that she reviewed the  Court's L ocal Rules and all orders \nentered in this case to discharge the show cause  order ( Filing No. 46 at 5 ). Milam attested to \nreviewing the L ocal Rules and made an affirmative commitment to comply with this Court's orders \nand directives ( Filing No. 50; Filing No. 53 ). \n2. Unauthorized Settlement  \nOn September 11, 2025, in Defendant's Morion to Extend Deadline to file its brief in \nsupport of opposition to plaintiff's motion to enforce settlement, GRSM's new counsel confirmed  \nthat \"Defendant never authorized any monetary settlement in this case \". (Filing No. 71 at ¶5 ).  \nWhile GRSM 's repeated failures to follow C ourt orders and focus on the case may have been poor \njudgment or negligence, participating in settlement negotiations when counsel knew it had no \n \n1 NIRVC 's internal counsel attested that she did not hear from Milam from the time she was  introduced as l ead counsel \non December 10, 2024,  until April 10,  2025,  and that she had her first call ever with Milam and Klutho on April 14, \n2025—only three days before the settlement conference ( Filing No. 76- 1 at 4 ). Case 1:24-cv-00491-TWP-CSW     Document 132     Filed 10/31/25     Page 4 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n authority to do so is willful bad conduct. Such conduct waste d not only the Court 's time, but also \nthat of opposing counsel. According to NIRVC , it never agreed to any settlement, or even \nsettlement negotiations , with monetary offers . (See Filing No. 76-1; Filing No. 76-2 ). In fact, \ninternal counsel for NIRVC declared in an email (dated August 5, 2025) with Milam copied, \" [y]ou \n(and others) may discuss numbers and potential liability all you want , but NIRVC will not consent \nto settle for even $1.\" ( Filing No. 76- 1 at 9 .) The record shows that since November 14, 2023, at \nthe latest, NIRVC had consistently told GRSM that it would not offer or agree to any monetary \nsettlement amount. Id.  at 3 (quoting email to GRSM from November 14, 2023: \" We are not \ninterested in settling this matter. \").  \nDespite k nowing that she did not have authority to engage in settlement negotiations, \nKlutho represented , by her actions , that GRSM had its client's authority to engage in settlement \nnegotiations, actively engaged in settlement neg otiations, and represented to Brzeg  that the case \nwas settled . Plaintiff 's counsel  had no reason to question Klutho's authority to discuss a monetary \nresolution or to believe that her communications leading up to the purported settlement \nagreement —memorialized in email communications—were unauthorized or contrary to her \nclient 's directives  (Filing No. 62-3 ). GRSM sent an email w ithout consent or authority to Brzeg , \nstating \"[p]er our conversation, we are settled for $[X].\" Id. Such conduct clearly shows an intent \nto deceive or gross negligence.  This conduct resulted in Plaintiff 's attorneys filing a Motion to \nEnforce the Settlement and incurring significant attorneys ' fees in seeking to enforce the \nsettlement.  \nAs the Court admonished Milam and Klutho at the pretrial conference on October 29, 2025, \nif GRSM did not have its  client 's authority to settle this case, its attorneys should have advised Case 1:24-cv-00491-TWP-CSW     Document 132     Filed 10/31/25     Page 5 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n opposing counsel and the M agistrate Judge of that  and should have not engaged in settlement \nconferences or settlement negotiations at all.  \nNIRVC itself has suggested the Court consider sanctions against GRSM , including \"paying \nthe purported settlement amount the GRSM Lawyers agreed to without Defendant 's knowledge or \nconsent and against its repeated, express authority to never settle the case .\" (Filing No. 69 at 4 ). \nNIRVC points out  that GRSM's attorneys' conduct  violat es the Indiana Rules of Professional \nConduct: \" A lawyer shall abide by a client 's decision whether to settle a matter .\" Id. at 3 ( citing \nInd. R. Prof. Cond. 1.2(a) (emphasis added) ). \nDespite professed  embarrassment2 for past misconduct , neither GRSM nor its attorneys , \nMilam and  Klutho, apologized to the Court or the parties for their repeated misconduct, including \ntheir unauthorized settlement negotiations and monetary settlement offers. The  Motions to \nWithdraw are devoid of any explanation or apology. ( See Filing No. 67; Filing No. 75 ). Neither \nMilam or Klutho showed remorse or offered an apology to the Court or the parties at the October \n29, 2025 final pretrial conference, which Milam and Klutho attended via videoconference.3  \nSanctions in the form of reasonable attorneys' fees are appropriate for GRSM, Milam, and \nKlutho's willful bad conduct and blatant  indifference towards th e Court's and the partie s' resources.  \n3. Reasonableness of Rates and Hours  \n\"A reasonable hourly rate is based on the local market rate for the attorney's services. \" \nMontanez v. Simon, 755 F.3d 547, 553 (7th Cir. 2014) . An attorney's \"market rate is the rate that \n \n2 In addition to Milam 's declared \"embarrassment \" to this Court for her failure to appear, just last week , GRSM \nprofessed  it was \" profoundly embarrassed\" for its attorneys ' misconduct involving artificial intelligence in another \nU.S. District Court. Gordon Rees Skully Mansukhani Response to Order to Show Cause, In the Matter of: Jackson \nHospital & Clinic, Inc., et al. , No. 25 -30256- CLF (October 23, 2025).   \n \n3 Milam did not even see fit to wear a suit jacket, and Klutho appeared only two minutes before the conference began, \nafter Milam (at the request of the Courtroom Deputy) called Klutho to ensure she would be attending. \n Case 1:24-cv-00491-TWP-CSW     Document 132     Filed 10/31/25     Page 6 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n lawyers of similar ability and experience in the community normally charge their paying clients \nfor the type of work in question.\" Bankston v. State of Ill., 60 F.3d 1249, 1256 (7th Cir. 1995)  \n(quotation omitted).  \nThe Court finds that Plaintiff 's counsel's hourly rates are reasonable and consistent with the \nhourly rates charged by other practitioners with similar experience. The Court also finds that the hours expended on this matter are reasonable considering the misrepresentations made by Defendant 's counsel on which Brzeg  relied.  Plaintiff's c ounsel provided detailed accounting of the \nhours worked in their  declarations ( Filing No. 122-1; Filing No. 122-2\n).  \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff 's Motion for Attorneys ' Fees was orally granted  at the October \n29, 2025 pretrial conference, and the Court orders  that Milam and Klutho 's firm, Gordon Re es \nScully Mansukhani , pay $15,610.00 as reasonable attorneys ' fees to Plaintiff 's counsel for \nlitigating the Motion to Enforce Settlement and Settlement Agreement ( Filing No. 62 ).  \nII.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court recommends dismissing Kimberly Hancock's complaint against the United States because it fails to state a claim. Hancock alleged that a government contractor, Crest Security, used her for an AI program, but she did not sufficiently establish any wrongdoing by the United States or any actionable claim. Additionally, her claim is barred by the statute of limitations since the alleged conduct occurred over 50 years ago.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's complaint sufficiently alleges a claim upon which relief can be granted against the United States.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court recommends dismissing the complaint because it fails to allege specific actions by the United States that could establish liability, fails to demonstrate any constitutional or statutory violations, and is barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone tells you they were wronged by a big company many years ago, but when they try to explain what happened, they can't really say how the company was involved or what rules were broken. The court needs a clear story before it can help. Here, Kimberly said a scary AI program did something wrong, but she didn't explain well enough how the big \"boss\" (like the government) is in trouble for it. Plus, she's bringing it up way too late, way longer than the rules usually allow. So, the court is saying, \"Sorry, we can't help with this one.\"",
    "full_text": "1 \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS  \nKIMBERLY D. HANCOCK,        Plaintiff,      v.     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,      Defendant.    \n               Case No. 25-1045-JWB-BGS \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \nFOR DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT \nPlaintiff Kimberly Hancock filed this action pro se1.  In conjunction with her federal court \ncomplaint (Doc. 1), Plaintiff filed a motion to proceed without prepayment of fees, which is a motion requesting leave for Plaintiff to proceed in forma pauperis  (“IFP”).  Doc. 3.  After review of \nPlaintiff’s complaint, however, the Court recommends  to the District Court that Plaintiff’s claims \nagainst Defendant be dismissed  for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \nI. Standard of Review for IFP Complaints  \nWhen a Plaintiff proceeds IFP, the court may screen the Complaint under 28 U.S.C. § \n1915(e)(2).  The court “shall dismiss” an in forma pa uperis case “at any time if the court determines \nthat … the action or appeal – (i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief \nmay be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief agai nst a defendant who is immune from such relief.”  \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2).  “When a plaintiff is pr oceeding in forma pauperis, a court has a duty to \nreview the complaint to ensure a proper bala nce between these comp eting interests.”  Mitchell v.  \nDeseret Health Care Facility , No. 13-1360-RDR-KGG, 2013 WL 5797609, at *1 (D. Kan. Sept. 30, \n \n1Plaintiff proceeds pro se.  The Court construes her filings liberally and holds her to a less stringent standard \nthan trained lawyers.  See Haines v. Kerner , 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972); Hall v. Bellmon , 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 \n(10th Cir. 1991).  But the Court does not assume th e role of advocate for the pro se litigant.  Hall, 935 F.2d at \n1110. Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 1 of 72 \n 2013).  The purpose of § 1915(e) is “the prev ention of abusive or capricious litigation.”  Harris v.  \nCampbell , 804 F. Supp. 153, 155 (D. Kan. 1992) (in ternal citation omitted) (discussing similar \nlanguage contained in § 1915(d), prior to the 1996 amendment).  Sua sponte  dismissal under § 1915(d) \nmay be appropriate when “on the face of the complain t it clearly appears that the action is frivolous \nor malicious.”  Hall v. Bellmon , 935 F.2d 1106, 1108 (10th Cir. 1991) (citing Henriksen v. Bentley , 644 \nF.2d 852, 854 (10th Cir.1981)). \nIn determining whether dismissal is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B), a plaintiff’s \ncomplaint will be analyzed by the Court under the same sufficiency standard as a Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  Kay v. Bemis , 500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. \n2007).  In conducting this analysis, the Court w ill accept as true all well-pleaded facts and draw all \nreasonable inferences from those fa cts in favor of a plaintiff.  See Moore v. Guthrie , 438 F.3d 1036, \n1039 (10th Cir. 2006). \nWhile a complaint generally need not plead detailed facts, it must give the defendant \nsufficient notice of the claims asserted by the pl aintiff so they may provide an appropriate answer.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a); Monroe v. Owens , 38 Fed. App’x. 510, 515 (10t h Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).  \nThis requires that a complaint contain three mini mal pieces of information: (1) a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is en titled to relief, (2) a short and plain statement of \nthe grounds upon which the court’s jurisdiction depend s, and (3) the relief requested.  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 8(a). \nBecause the court will liberally c onstrue the pleadings of a pro se  plaintiff, the court should \n“reasonably read the pleadings to state a valid cl aim on which the plaintiff could prevail … despite \nthe plaintiff’s failure to cite proper legal authori ty, his confusion of various legal theories, his poor \nsyntax and sentence construction, or his unfamiliarity with pleading requirements.”  Hall, 935 F.2d at \n1110.  The court cannot, however, become an advocate for the pro se  plaintiff.  Id. Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 2 of 73 \n A pro se  plaintiff’s complaint must still “set forth the grounds of plaintiff’s entitlement to \nrelief through more than labels, conclusions, and a fo rmulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of \naction.”  Fisher v. Lynch , 531 F.Supp.2d 1253, 1260 (D. Kan. 2008) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955,  1964–65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), and Hall, 935 F.2d at 1110 \n(holding that a plaintiff need not precisely sta te each element, but must plead minimal factual \nallegations on those material elements that must be proven)).  “In other words, plaintiff must allege \nsufficient facts to state a claim which is plausible – rather than merely conceivable – on its face.”  Id. \n(citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S. Ct. at 1974).  See also  Bemis , 500 F.3d at 1218 (stating that \nfactual allegations in the complaint must establish “above the speculative level” that plaintiff is entitled to relief). \nThe Court’s relaxed scrutiny of the pro se plai ntiff’s pleadings “does not relieve [him] of the \nburden of alleging sufficient facts on which a recognized legal claim could be based.”  Hall, 935 F.2d \nat 1110.  A pro se  plaintiff’s pleading conclusory statements  is insufficient to state a claim because \nno special legal training is required to “recount the facts surrounding his alleged injury[.]”  Id.  See \nalso Olson v. Carmack , 641 Fed. App’x. 822, 825 (10th Cir. 2016).  If this Court finds, after construing \nthe allegations in Plaintiff’s complaint liberally, th at Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which \nrelief may be granted, the court is compelled to recommend that the action be dismissed. \nII. Plaintiff’s Claims and Factual Allegations \nPlaintiff’s complaint does not contain much d etail, but from what the Court can ascertain, \nher allegations pertain to an artificial intelligence (“AI”) program run by a government contractor.  \nHancock alleges that Crest Security, who she identifi es as a defense contractor, left her inside of a \ncentral intelligence agency (“CIA”) container for pur poses of AI research.  She goes on to state that \nshe wants out of Crest’s AI program. \nHancock claims 1 billion dollars’ worth of damage s.  In support thereof, she states that was Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 3 of 74 \n put into custody by Crest Security on October 4, 1973 , at the time of her birth.  Allegedly, she was \nforcefully held in custody her entire life.  In addition to monetary damages, she seeks a “re-entry \nteam” for her future.  Doc. 1. \nIII. Analysis \nPlaintiff does not identify any specific claims .  However, in the form complaint, she checks \nthe box which indicates “[t]his cases arises because  of a violation of the civil or equal rights, \nprivileges, or immunities accorded to citizens of, or persons within the jurisdiction, of the United \nStates (28 U.S.C. § 1343)”.  As a pro se plaintiff, Ms. Hancock is held to a less stringent standard.  \nNonetheless, the Court will not supply additional facts  or guess what claims Plaintiff is trying to \nassert.  See Whitney v. State of N.M. , 113 F.3d 1170, 1173-74 (10th Cir.  1997).  With that in mind, \nPlaintiff’s complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and the undersigned \nrecommends  that Plaintiff’s complaint be dismissed  for the reasons stated below. \nA. Failure to State a Claim \n1. No allegations against the United States \n \nPlaintiff’s complaint names one Defendant: The United States of America.  She alleges no \naction or conduct on the part of the United States.  Her complaint is void of any mention of the United States and how it may have taken part in the underlying allegations.  In other words, the \ncomplaint presents no legal theory on how the United States is liable for the events described in the \ncomplaint.   Because Hancock's complaint does not allege facts implicating the United States, it \nwould be impossible for her to prevail on any claim asserted against it.  Brantley v. Radar , No. 25-\n2046-EFM-ADM, 2025 WL 388654, at *2  (D. Kan. Feb. 4, 2025).  This alone is fatal to Plaintiff’s \nclaims.2 \n \n2Often, a plaintiff is required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to bringing a lawsuit against the United \nStates.  See, e.g. , Lopez v. United States , 823 F.3d 970, 976 (10th Cir. 2016).   In many instances, the exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies is a jurisdictional requirement.  Compare Rowland v. Matevousian , 121 F.4th 1237, 1246 Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 4 of 75 \n 2. No Colorable Cause of Action \nPlaintiff indicates in her complaint that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1343.  Doc. 1, at 3.  “Section 1343 grants federal di strict courts jurisdiction to hear civil rights cases, \nbut this statute does not specifically provide a cause of action.”  See Smith v. G&W Foods , No. 20-\nCV-2517, 2021 WL 1546222, at *4 (D . Kan. Apr. 20, 2021).  Under this Title, a federal district court \nhas original jurisdiction over actions to “redress [ ] deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, \nordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any” Cons titutional or statutory right of a United States \ncitizen.  28 U.S.C. § 1343(a)(3). \nHere, Plaintiff’s complaint does not specify what constitutional, or statutory rights have been \nviolated by the United States or any other potential  defendant.  As already mentioned, the Court will \nnot guess what claims Plaintiff is attempting to a ssert.  Plaintiff makes va gue references to Crest \nSecurity and being subject to an “AI program.”  Arguably, the complaint could be construed as an attempt to bring a § 1983 civil rights claim.  However, the Plaintiff points to no constitutional violation which would be prosecuted under § 1983.   Simply put, Plaintiff does not supply any \nallegations supporting any actionable claim.  See Brantley , 2025 WL 388654, at *2 (recommending \ndismissal of complaint because plaintiff failed to make “factual allegations against any named \ndefendant that would support a claim”).  Therefore, the Court recommends  dismissal because \nPlaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \n \n(10th Cir. 2024) (holding that the admini strative exhaustion requirement unde r the FTCA is jurisdictional and \ncannot be waived), with Lincoln v. BNSF Ry. Co. , 900 F.3d 1166, 1185-86 (10th Cir. 2018) (holding that failure \nto exhaust administrative remedies under the ADA is not jurisdictional).  Either way, the failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies is often fatal to a lawsuit.  Kansas by & through Kansas Dep't for Child. & Fams. v. \nSourceAmerica , 874 F.3d 1226, 1250 (10th Cir. 2017).  To the extent  Hancock intended to bring a claim under \nthe Federal Tort Claims Act, the Court would lack subject-matter jurisdiction.  See Rowland , 121 F.4th at 1246 \n(10th Cir. 2024).  If there are other claims Hancock is att empting to bring, her failu re to exhaust could also \nprove fatal to her claims.   See, e.g. , Lincoln , 900 F.3d at 1185-86 (10th Cir. 2018).  The Court declines to \nrecommend dismissal on this basis because it is unclea r what claims Plaintiff is attempting to assert.  \nHowever, the Court notes that Hancock’s failure to ex haust any administrative remedies likely presents \nproblems if she wants to maintain a claim against the United States.  Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 5 of 76 \n B. Statute of Limitations has Expired \nThe Court also has concerns regarding the statu te of limitations.  Assuming that Plaintiff is \nattempting to bring a § 1983 claim, the statute of  limitations is determined by the relevant state \nstatute of limitations and tolling principles.  See Hardin v. Straub , 490 U.S. 536, 539 (1989).  “The \nforum state’s statute of limitations for personal injury actions governs civil rights claims under both 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and § 1983.  In Kansas, that is  the two-year statute of limitations in K.S.A. § 60-\n513(a).”  Brown v. Unified School Dist. 501, Topeka Public Schools , 465 F .3d 1184, 1188 (10th Cir. 2006) \n(citations omitted).  While state law governs the le ngth of the limitations period and tolling issues, \n“the accrual date of a § 1983 cause of action is a question of federal law.”  Wallace v. Kato , 549 U.S. \n384, 388 (2007).  Under federal law, the claim accrues “when the plaintiff has ‘a complete and \npresent cause of action.’”  Id. at 388.  In other words, “[a] § 1983 action ‘accrues when facts that \nwould support a cause of action ar e or should be apparent.’”  Fogle v. Pierson , 435 F.3d 1252, 1258 \n(10th Cir. 2006).  The Court may determine that pr oposed amendments are futile if it is clear from \nthe allegations that the action is barred by the statute of limitations.  See Fogle , 435 F.3d at 11 1258-\n59. \nHere, it is unclear when the statute exactly began to run, but the complained of conduct \noccurred more than 50-years ago.  Her complaint st ates that she was held by Crest Security in 1973 \nbut gives no other details other than to say it was pa rt of an “AI program.”  In Plaintiff’s motion for \nappointment of counsel, she indicates that she ha s been contacting attorn eys since at least 2018 \nwhich shows that she was on notice of the claims in  this suit and capable of advancing a lawsuit.  See \nDoc. 4.  At minimum, 6 years have passed since she was contacting attorneys regarding the underlying suit.  More than 50-years since the comp lained of conduct.  This is significantly more \ntime than any applicable statute of limitations.  Accordingly, the Court also recommends  dismissal \nbecause the statute of limitations has run. Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 8     Filed 04/29/25     Page 6 of 77 \n IV. Conclusion \nFor the reasons explained above, the Magistrate Judge recommends  that the District Judge \ndismiss  Plaintiff's complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 (e)(2)(B)(ii) because Plaintiff's complaint does \nnot state a claim upon which relief may be gran ted and the statute of limitations has run . \nIT IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED  to the District Court that Plaintiff’s complaint \n(Doc. 1) be DISMISSED  for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. \nIT IS ORDERED  that a copy of the recommendation shall be sent to Plaintiff via certified \nmail.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1), Fed R. Civ. P. 72, and D. Kan. Rule 72.1.4, Plaintiff shall \nhave fourteen (14) days after service of a copy of these proposed findings and recommendations to \nserve and file with the U.S. District Judge assigned to the case, any written objections to the findings \nof fact, conclusions of law, or recommendations of the undersigned Magistrate Judge.  Plaintiff’s \nfailure to file such written, specific objections with in the 14-day period will bar appellate review of \nthe proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the recommended disposition.  See Moore v. \nUnited States , 950 F.2d 656 (10th Cir. 1991). \nIT IS SO RECOMMENDED. Dated April 29, 2025, at Wichita, Kansas. \n \n/s/\n BROOKS SEVERSON   \nBrooks G.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii denied Plaintiff Sam Monet's motion for reconsideration and a second motion for judicial disclosure. The court found no grounds for reconsideration, rejecting claims of fraud, newly discovered evidence, and allegations that the court's decisions were influenced by artificial intelligence. The case did involve Plaintiff's unsubstantiated claim that a prior order was AI-generated, indicating an AI-related aspect to the case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Plaintiff was entitled to reconsideration of the court’s prior rulings and the disclosure of alleged ex parte communications due to supposed new evidence or potential fraud, including undocumented claims of AI involvement in court decisions.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motions, ruling that Plaintiff failed to provide new evidence, establish fraud, or justify reconsideration under Rule 60(b). Additionally, Plaintiff's allegations regarding AI and systemic corruption were deemed baseless. All claims in the case were resolved, and judgment was entered in favor of the defendants.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you get a bad grade on a test, and you ask the teacher to check it again because you think there's a mistake. But you don't have any new evidence to show why the grade should be changed, and you even suspect that a robot graded your test. The teacher looks at your case again and decides there's no reason to change your grade. In this court case, the plaintiff, like you with the grade, didn't give the court good reasons or evidence to change its previous decision, and the case ended without any changes.",

CIV. NO. 21-00368 LEK-KJM \n \n  \n \n \nORDER DENYING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR \nRECONSIDERATION OF ORDER FILED 10-31-2023 AND \nDENYING PLAINTIFF’S SECOND MOTION FOR JUDICIAL DISCLOSURE \n \n  On October 31, 2023 this Court filed the Order: \nDenying Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to \nCount V; Granting Defendant Gordon Wood’s Motion for Summary Judgment; and Granting Defendant Edward Underwood’s Motion for Summary Judgment (“10/31/23 Order”). [Dkt. no. 158.\n1] On \nNovember 28, 2023, pro se Plaintiff Sam Monet (“Plaintiff”) filed his motion for reconsideration of the 10/31/23 Order (“Motion for Reconsideration”).\n2 [Dkt. no. 161.] The Motion for \n \n 1 The 10/31/23 Order is also available at 2023 WL 7166479. \n \n2 This Court previously granted Plaintiff an extension of \nthe deadline to seek reconsideration of the 10/31/23 Order. See \n         (. . . continued) Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 1 of 11  PageID.<pageID>2 \n Reconsideration is suitable for disposition without a hearing \nand without further briefing. See Local Rule LR7.1(d); Local \nRule LR60.1. Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration is hereby denied for the reasons set forth below. Further, in light of the \ndenial of the Motion for Reconsideration, Plaintiff’s Second \nMotion for Judicial Disclosure (“Second Disclosure Motion”), [filed 12/4/23 (dkt. no. 163),] is also denied. \nDISCUSSION  \n  The parties and this Court are familiar with the \nfactual and procedural background of this case, and it need not be repeated here. I. Standards \n  Because the 10/31/23 Order was case dispositive, Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration is “governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 or 60, as applicable.” See Local Rule LR60.1. Because \nno judgment has been issued in this case, Fed. R. Civ. P. 60 applies. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) (“A motion to alter or amend \na judgment must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.”). Rule 60(b) states, in pertinent part: “On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its \nlegal representative from a final . . . order, or proceeding for \n \nMinute Order – EO: Court Order Granting Plaintiff’s Motion to \nExtend Time to File Motion for Reconsideration, filed 11/9/23 \n(dkt. no. 160) (extending the deadline from 11/14/23 to \n11/28/23). Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 2 of 11  PageID.<pageID>3 \n the following reasons: . . . or (6) any other reason that \njustifies relief.” The Ninth Circuit has stated: \nWe use Rule 60(b)(6) “sparingly as an equitable \nremedy to prevent manifest injustice.” United \nStates v. Alpine Land & Reservoir Co., 984 F.2d \n1047, 1049 (9th Cir. 1993). To receive relief under Rule 60(b)(6), a party must demonstrate \n“extraordinary circumstances which prevented or \nrendered him unable to prosecute [his case].” \n[Cmty. Dental Servs. v.] Tani, 282 F.3d [1164,] \n1168 [(9th Cir. 2002)] (citing Martella v. Marine \nCooks & Stewards Union, 448 F.2d 729, 730 (9th \nCir. 1971) (per curiam)).  \nLal v. California, 610 F.3d 518, 524 (9th Cir. 2010) (some \nalterations in Lal).   \n  As to motions for reconsideration in general, this \ndistrict court has stated: \nA motion for reconsideration must: \n(1) demonstrate reasons that the court should \nreconsider its prior decision; and (2) must set \nforth facts or law of a strongly convincing \nnature to induce the court to reverse its prior \ndecision. Fisher v. Kealoha, 49 F. Supp. 3d 727, \n734 (D. Haw. 2014). The Ninth Circuit has said that reconsideration may be appropriate if: (1) the district court is presented with newly \ndiscovered evidence; (2) the district court \ncommitted clear error or the initial decision was \nmanifestly unjust; or (3) if there is an \nintervening change in controlling law. See Sch. \nDist. No. 1J, Multnomah Cty., Or. v. ACandS, \nInc., 5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir. 1993). \n \n Mere disagreement with a previous order is \nan insufficient basis for reconsideration. \nFisher, 49 F. Supp. 3d at 735. This court \n“‘enjoys considerable discretion in granting or denying the motion.’” Allstate Ins. Co. v. \nHerron, 634 F.3d 1101, 1111 (9th Cir. 2011) Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 3 of 11  PageID.<pageID>4 \n (quoting McDowell v. Calderon, 197 F.3d 1253, \n1255 n.1 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc)). \n \nSmith v. Frink, Civil No. 20-00377 SOM-RT, 2020 WL 7130511, at \n*2 (D. Hawai`i Dec. 4, 2020).   \nII. Scope of the Motion for Reconsideration \n  The Motion for Reconsideration includes arguments that it was error to: deny him the opportunity to file a third amended complaint; grant immunity to Defendants Senator Sharon Moriwaki (“Moriwaki”) and State of Hawai`i Attorney General, in \nher official capacity (“Attorney General”); and deny his motion \nto disclose any ex parte communications with former Attorney General Clare Connors.\n3 See, e.g., Motion for Reconsideration at \n11, 31, 35. To the extent that Plaintiff seeks reconsideration of those rulings, his requests are denied as untimely.  A. Third Amended Complaint \n  On August 12, 2022, the magistrate judge issued an \nOrder Granting in Part and Denying in Part Plaintiff’s Motion \nfor Leave to File Third Amended Complaint (“8/12/22 Order”). \n \n3 Clare Connors was the Attorney General at the time of the \nevents that were the basis of Plaintiff’s claims in this case, and Plaintiff originally named Clare Connors, in her official \ncapacity, as a defendant in this case. See Complaint for \nDeclaratory, Compensatory and Injunctive Relief, and Civil Penalties, filed 8/30/21 (dkt. no. 1), at ¶¶ 149, 172. By the \ntime Plaintiff filed his First Amended Complaint, Clare Connors \nwas no longer the Attorney General, and Plaintiff named \n“Defendant Attorney General State of Hawaii” as a party instead. \nSee First Amended Complaint, filed 2/11/22 (dkt. no. 36), at \n¶ 27 (emphasis omitted). Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 4 of 11  PageID.<pageID>5 \n [Dkt. no. 74.] Plaintiff filed his Third Amended Complaint on \nAugust 22, 2022. [Dkt. no. 75.] The magistrate judge struck the Third Amended Complaint because Plaintiff did not comply with the terms of the 8/12/22 Order, but allowed Plaintiff to file \nanother third amended complaint by September 15, 2022. [EO, \nfiled 9/9/22 (dkt. no. 80).] Plaintiff filed another Third Amended Complaint on September 13, 2022. [Dkt. no. 82.] Because that version also failed to comply with the 8/12/22 Order, it was also stricken, and the magistrate judge denied Plaintiff leave to file another version of the third amended complaint. See Order Granting Defendants Edward Underwood and Gordon Wood’s \nMotion to Strike Third Amended Complaint Filed September 13, \n2022, filed 9/29/22 (dkt. no. 87) (“9/29/22 Order”). [Dkt. \nno. 87.] This left Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint, [filed 6/25/22 (dkt. no. 65),] as the operative pleading. See 9/29/22 \nOrder at 5.    Because the magistrate judge’s 9/29/22 Order was a nondispositive order, Local Rule 60.1 applies. See Local \nRule LR60.1 (setting forth the grounds upon which a motion for reconsideration of an interlocutory order may be brought). A \nmotion for reconsideration alleging “[m]anifiest error of law or \nfact” must be brought “within fourteen days after the court’s Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 5 of 11  PageID.<pageID>6 \n order is issued.”4 Id. Because Plaintiff filed the instant Motion \nfor Reconsideration more than fourteen days after the filing of \nthe 9/29/22 Order, the request for reconsideration of the 9/29/22 Order is untimely. Similarly, even if that portion of \nthe Motion for Reconsideration is construed as an objection to \nthe 9/29/22 Order, it is also untimely. See Local Rule 74.1(a) \n(“a party may object to a magistrate judge’s non-dispositive order . . . within fourteen (14) days after being served”).  B. Dismissal of Moriwaki and the Attorney General \n  Plaintiff’s claims against Moriwaki, in her individual \ncapacity, and the Attorney General were dismissed with prejudice. [Order Granting in Part and Denying in Part the State \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss [036] First Amended Complaint \nFiled February 11, 2022, filed 5/31/22 (dkt. no. 62) (“5/31/22 Order”), at 38.\n5] Plaintiff’s arguments in the instant Motion for \nReconsideration regarding the dismissal of Moriwaki and the Attorney General are based upon alleged errors of law and fact. See, e.g., Motion for Reconsideration at 31. He was therefore \nrequired to seek reconsideration within fourteen days after the \n \n4 The fourteen-day filing period does not apply to motions \nfor reconsideration asserting there is newly discovered evidence \nor an intervening change in the law. See Local Rule LR60.1. \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration, however, does not identify any newly discovered evidence or change in the law \nregarding the filing of his third amended complaint. \n \n5 The 5/31/22 Order is also available at 2022 WL 1748442. Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 6 of 11  PageID.<pageID>7 \n 5/31/22 Order was filed. Because Plaintiff failed to do so, the \nportion of the Motion for Reconsideration challenging the dismissal of Moriwaki and the Attorney General is denied as untimely. \n C. Disclosure Motion \n  On May 17, 2023, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Judicial \nDisclosure of Ex Parte Communications and Request for In-Person Hearing (“Disclosure Motion”). [Dkt. no. 136.] The magistrate judged denied the Disclosure Motion in an entering order filed on May 23, 2023 (“5/23/23 EO”). [Dkt. no. 140.] The Motion for Reconsideration’s arguments regarding the denial of his Disclosure Motion are based upon alleged errors of law and fact. \nSee, e.g., Motion for Reconsideration at 34. Because Plaintiff \nfailed to either seek reconsideration of the 5/23/23 EO or \nappeal within fourteen days after it was served, the portion of the Motion for Reconsideration challenging the 5/23/23 EO is denied as untimely.  D. Summary \n  The only timely requests for reconsideration or \nappeals in Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration are his \nrequests for reconsideration of rulings in the 10/31/23 Order. \nAny requests for reconsideration or appeals presented in the Motion for Reconsideration that address any order prior to the 10/31/23 Order - including any requests for reconsideration or Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 7 of 11  PageID.<pageID>8 \n appeals not specifically mentioned in this Order - are denied as \nuntimely. III. Requests for Reconsideration of the 10/31/23 Order  \n  Plaintiff argues there has been “[f]raud upon the \nCourt,” and that “new evidence is available[.]” [Motion for \nReconsideration at 1.] However, Plaintiff does not identify any new evidence, and instead he cites exhibits that are already available to this Court when it issued the 10/31/23 Order. Cf. \nMotion for Reconsideration at 23 (“All of this filed documentation was available to this court . . . .”). Plaintiff also presents no evidence of fraud. He merely speculates that Defendant Edward Underwood (“Underwood”) lied in his \ndeclaration, see id. at 5, but he does not provide any evidence \nto support that allegation. Plaintiff also states he “dispute[s] \nthe factual accuracy of Paragraphs 7(a), 7(b), 7(c), 9(b), and 10 of Corey Fujioka’s declaration.” [Id. at 12.] The 10/31/23 \nOrder acknowledged there were some disputes of fact and that this Court could not weigh the credibility of the conflicting statements on summary judgment. This Court granted summary judgment to Underwood and Defendant Gordon Wood (“Wood”), \nconcluding that, even viewing the record in the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiff as the nonmoving party, Underwood and Wood were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See, e.g., \n10/31/23 Order 38-39 & n.18. Plaintiff’s Motion for Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 8 of 11  PageID.<pageID>9 \n Reconsideration does not establish either fraud upon the Court \nor the existence of newly discovered evidence.   Plaintiff raises other unsubstantiated arguments, including that: the 10/31/23 Order was not written by this Court \nand was instead generated using artificial intelligence; and the \n10/31/23 Order is evidence of systemic corruption and racism. See, e.g., id. at 2, 31-35. These baseless allegations do not \nconstitute grounds for reconsideration of the 10/31/23 Order. Plaintiff’s arguments regarding the grant of summary judgment in favor of Underwood and Wood merely express Plaintiff’s disagreement with this Court’s rulings, and his disagreement is not grounds for reconsideration of the rulings in the 10/31/23 \nOrder. See Fisher, 49 F. Supp. 3d at 735. \nIV. Summary and the Second Disclosure Motion \n  Plaintiff has failed to establish any ground that \nwarrants reconsideration of the 10/31/23 Order, and he has failed to raise a timely challenge to the other orders that he addresses in the Motion for Reconsideration. The Motion for Reconsideration must therefore be denied in its entirety. In light of the denial of the Motion for Reconsideration, there are \nno remaining claims in this case, and Plaintiff is not entitled \nto any disclosures. Plaintiff’s Second Disclosure Motion must also be denied. Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 9 of 11  PageID.<pageID>10 \n CONCLUSION  \n  For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s November 28, \n2023 Motion for Reconsideration of Order Filed 10-31-2023 is HEREBY DENIED. In light of the denial of Plaintiff’s Motion for \nReconsideration, Plaintiff’s Second Motion for Judicial \nDisclosure, filed December 4, 2023, is also DENIED.   There being no remaining claims in this case, the Clerk’s Office is DIRECTED to enter judgment and close the case immediately. Judgment is to be entered as follows: -in favor of Defendants Edward Underwood and Gordon Wood, \npursuant to the Order: Denying Plaintiff’s Motion for \nPartial Summary Judgment as to Count V; Granting Defendant \nGordon Wood’s Motion for Summary Judgment; and Granting \nDefendant Edward Underwood’s Motion for Summary Judgment; [filed 10/31/23 (dkt. no. 158)]; \n \n-in favor of Defendants Senator Sharon Moriwaki and Attorney \nGeneral of the State of Hawai`i, pursuant to the Order \nGranting in Part and Denying in Part the State Defendants’ \nMotion to Dismiss [036] First Amended Complaint Filed \nFebruary 11, 2022; [filed 5/31/22 (dkt. no. 62);] and  \n \n-in favor of Defendants State of Hawai`i, Hawai`i Department of \nLand and Natural Resources, and Division of Conservation \nand Resources Enforcement, pursuant to the Order Granting \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss [001] Complaint Filed \nAugust 30, 2021, [filed 1/11/22 (dkt. no. 33)]. \n   IT IS SO ORDERED. \n  \n  Case 1:21-cv-00368-LEK-KJM   Document 164   Filed 12/05/23   Page 10 of 11 \nPageID.<pageID>11 \n  DATED AT HONOLULU, HAWAII, December 5, 2023. \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSAM MONET VS.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court dismissed William Lorenzo Coleman's § 1983 complaint against the City and Borough of Juneau, along with individual defendants, including police officers, for failing to meet the necessary pleading requirements. Coleman, representing himself, alleged violations of his constitutional rights stemming from an unlawful arrest and events that transpired in September 2020, but did not effectively articulate these claims or establish connections between the defendants' actions and the alleged violations. No AI, ML, or automated systems are referenced in this case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff’s complaint adequately states a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by sufficiently alleging facts that demonstrate a violation of constitutional rights by defendants acting under the color of state law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Coleman's complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because it lacked necessary detail, logical structure, and clarity. The court dismissed the complaint without prejudice, granting Coleman leave to amend his complaint to address the deficiencies.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're trying to tell a story about why someone did something wrong to you, but your story is super messy and hard to follow. You also don't explain clearly who did what or why it's a problem. The judge told Coleman that his story (complaint) about how the police and the city wronged him wasn't clear enough and gave him a chance to rewrite it in a clearer, more organized way.",

Procedural History \nOn April 11, 2023, William Lorenzo Coleman, a self-represented prisoner \n(hereinafter “Plaintiff”), filed a Prisoner’s Complaint under the Civil Rights Act, 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 (hereinafter “Complaint”), a Civil Cover Sheet, a Prisoner’s Application \nto Waive Prepayment of the Filing Fee, an Unissued Summons, a General Affidavit, \nand a Certification/Proof of Service.2  Subsequently, Plaintiff filed Exhibit A, a copy \n \n1 See Local Rule 7.5.  \n2 Docs. 1-6. \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 1 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v.

In this screening, a court shall dismiss the case \nat any time if the court determines that the action:  \n(i) is frivolous or malicious; \n(ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or \n(iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such \nrelief.4 \nTo determine whether a complaint states a valid claim for relief, courts \nconsider whether the complaint contains sufficient factual matter that, if accepted \nas true, “state[s] a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”5  In conducting its \nreview, a court must liberally construe a self-represented plaintiff’s pleading and \ngive the plaintiff the benefit of the doubt.6   \n \n3 Doc. 8.   Exhibit A documents a Misdemeanor Criminal Complaint related to Plaintiff’s \nComplaint. Plaintiff states his charges were dismissed on July 15, 2021; however, the Docket \navailable to the Court suggests his charges were dismissed June 1, 2021.  The Court also \nnotes that Plaintiff had a non-criminal case involving a “Pedestrian Signal Infraction,” which \nappears related to Plaintiff’s Complaint.  This non-criminal case was recently closed, and a \ndefault judgment was entered against Plaintiff after he failed to appear in February 2023.  \nSee City and Borough of Juneau vs. Coleman, William Lorenzon , 1JU-22-01564MO, \nhttps://records.courts.alaska.gov/eaccess/searchresults.page?x=xbx0Z1uOUNUihiy1ooB3E\n7YezI9PVJTfxU3Shmes8kHVlJax8XzgAGyNsef2fedw6yWiVIEV1xMdh4W9kOLj3g. \n4 28 U.S.C. § 1915A. \n5 Ashcroft v.

Claim One is made against \nall defendants and alleges that Defendant Reid subjected Plaintiff to excessive force \nand violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and \nseizure. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Reid stopped and frisked him \nwithout legal justification, and planted incriminating evidence on Plaintiff.22  \nPlaintiff also appears to assert Defendant Reid invaded his right to privacy as well.23 \nWithout greater explanation, Plaintiff merely states that Defendant Reid “knew or \nshould have known his actions were violative of rights guaranteed to the plaintiff \nbeing in a protect[ed] class group as an African American.”24 Plaintiff further claims \nthat Defendants acted in both their individual and official capacities in violating \nPlaintiff’s rights.25 \n In Claim Two, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Juneau violated Plaintiff’s \nFourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by failing “to train, supervise, and \ndiscipline police officers from committing the unwarranted batteries and using \nexcessive force, or allowing such activities, against civilian[] citizens such as \nplaintiff.”26 Plaintiff concedes that “the actions of Defendants were done under state \nlaw.”27 \n Plaintiff asserts a claim of battery under Alaska law against all Defendants for \nClaim Three.28 Plaintiff faults Defendants for placing him in a court holding cell \n \n21 Id.  \n22 Id. at 10.  \n23 Id.  \n24 Id.  \n25 Id. at 11.

After Claim Three, but before Claim Four, Plaintiff includes a section called \n“Newly Discovered Impeachment Evidence of the State Witness [Defendant] Reid.”  Plaintiff \nmaintains that Defendant Juneau fired Defendant Reid and “placed him under police \nprotection based on the wrongful death complaint of Mr. [] Spring …. Stemming from an \nincident that occurred on or about September 26, 2020.”  Doc. 1 at 16.  Plaintiff also asserts \n“Defendants are liable to the Estate of Cody Eyre for common law torts under Alaska law, \nincluding ass[a]ult and battery.”  Id.  The Court is unclear who these parties are and their \nrelationship to Plaintiff’s allegations.  Plaintiff does references in this portion of his \nComplaint a policy, practice and custom by Defendants of failing “to investigate, discipline, \nreprimand or instruct their officers in any way”  and claims “Defendant Officers’ actions \nwere a direct and proximate cause of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff.”  Id.   The Court \nassumes that Plaintiff included the information about Mr. Spring and the Estate of Eyre to \ndemonstrate that Defendant Reid has a pattern of “malicious and unconstitutional” \nbehavior.    \n31 Id. at 17.  \n32 Id.  \n33 Id. at 9.  \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 6 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v.

Civil Rights Claims Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nSection 1983 is a federal statute that “is not itself a source of substantive \nrights,” but provides “a method for vindicating rights [found] elsewhere.”34  \nConstitutional rights are those conferred by the United States Constitution to \nindividual citizens.  Section 1983 can be used as a mechanism for enforcing the rights \nguaranteed by a particular federal statute only if (1) the statute creates enforceable \nrights and (2) Congress has not foreclosed the possibility of a § 1983 remedy for \nviolations of the statute in question.35  Section 1983 does not provide a cause of \naction for violations of state law.36  In order to plead a proper § 1983 claim, a plaintiff \nmust allege plausible facts that if proven would establish each of the required \nelements of:  “(1) a violation of rights protected by the Constitution or created by \nfederal statute, (2) proximately caused (3) by conduct of a ‘person’ (4) acting under \ncolor of state law.”37   \nSection 1983 also requires that a defendant must be “acting under the color of \nstate law.”38  The question of whether a person who has allegedly caused a \nconstitutional injury was acting under the color of state law is a factual \ndetermination.39  A defendant has acted under color of state law where he or she has \n“exercised power ‘possessed by the virtue of state law and made possible only \nbecause the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.’”40   \n \n34 Graham v. Connor , 490 U.S. 386, 393-94 (1989) (quoting  Baker v. McCollan , 443 U.S. 137, \n144 n.3 (1979)). \n35 Blessing v. Freestone , 520 U.S. 329, 340-41 (1997); Dittman v.

City and Borough of Juneau, et al.  \n1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR  8  \n This essential element of the statute limits who may be a proper defendant \nunder § 1983.  For instance, private citizens, state governmental agencies, and states \nare generally not proper defendants in a § 1983 action.41 States have sovereign \nimmunity due to the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which makes \nthem immune from suit unless that immunity is waived.42 “States or governmental \nentities that are considered ‘arms of the State’ for Eleventh Amendment purposes \nare not ‘persons’ under § 1983.”43   \nIV. Pleading Requirements for Causes of Action Raised by Plaintiff  \nPlaintiff does not meet the basic pleading requirements to sufficiently state a \nclaim under § 1983, therefore the Court dismisses Plaintiff’s Complaint.  However, \nthe Court grants Plaintiff leave to amend to bring his complaint into compliance with \nthe applicable law and rules. The Court also provides guidance for claims made \nunder § 1983 and specifically for any First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth \nAmendment claims that Plaintiff may be attempting to allege.44  \na. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 8 directs that a complaint shall include “a short \nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief[.]”  \nPlaintiff’s Complaint fails to meet this basic standard.   Plaintiff’s allegations are \nnon-linear and rambling, include irrelevant narrative, are conclusory, and leave the \nCourt with either no way of determining who Plaintiff is attempting to sue, or how \n \n41 See 42 U.S.C. § 1983; Flint v. Dennison ,488 F.3d 816, 824-25 (9th Cir. 2007); Hale v. \nArizona, 993 F.2d 1387, 1398 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc).  \n42 In re New York , 256 U.S. 490, 497 (1921) (holding federal courts may not hear suits against \na state brought by their own citizens, “because of the fundamental rule of which the \n[Eleventh] Amendment is but an exemplification.”); see also Hans v. Louisiana , 134 U.S. 1, \n15 (1890). \n43 Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Nat’l Lab ., 131 F.3d 836, 839 (9th Cir. 1997); quoting Will v. \nMich. Dep’t of State Police , 491 U.S. 58, 70 (1989)). \n44 The Court is not providing guidance on potential Eighth Amendment claims.  It appears \nas if Plaintiff was a pre-trial detainee at the time of the events in his Complaint.  Accordingly, \nthe Fourteenth Amendment applies, not the Eighth Amendment, which may be raised only \nby convicted criminals. \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 8 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v. City and Borough of Juneau, et al.  \n1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR  9  \n any individuals Plaintiff does identify violated his constitutional rights.  As a result, \nthe Court orders dismissal of Plaintiff’s Complaint with leave to amend.  \nRather than identifying each claim clearly and separately and stating the \nunderlying facts that support each claim, Plaintiff’s Complaint lists statutes and \nConstitutional Amendments at the beginning of his Complaint and then proceeds \nwith 20 pages of occasionally repetitive narrative and conclusory allegations.45  For \nexample, Plaintiff states generally that Defendants violated his First, Fifth and Sixth \nAmendment rights.46   However, in none of the specific claims made by Plaintiff is \nthere mention of any such violations or conduct that could reasonably be interpreted \nto include such violations.  In addition, as detailed below, Plaintiff names unknown \ndefendants in his complaint, but fails to provide any information describing what \nthose unknown defendants did.  Plaintiff’s Complaint also alleges dates that are \ninconsistent or contrary to the public record and speaks on at least two occasions of \n“Artificial Intelligence” relating to his right hand.47 \nFinally, Plaintiff’s Complaint makes multiple inconsistent demands for \ndamages.  In his general claims Plaintiff seeks $50,000 to $250,000 in compensatory \ndamages, and the same amount in punitive damages.48  However, after specific \nClaims One and Two, Plaintiff request those amounts for each violation, and \nincreases the punitive request for Claim Two to $1,000,000.49  Claims Three and \nFour are similarly inconsistent with Plaintiff’s original request, as his Prayer for \nRelief, which seeks compensatory damages “in excess of $100,000” and punitive \ndamages in an amount “to be proven at trial.”50       \n \n45 See Pettit v. State of New Mexico , 375 F. Supp. 2d 1140, 1150 (D. N.M. 2004) (listing dozens \nof statutes is insufficient to state a claim). \n46 Doc. 1 at 4. \n47 Id. at 4, 9.

Defendants \nAs detailed in his Complaint, Plaintiff alleges acts against him and identifies \n12 potential defendants.  However, Plaintiff does not sufficiently articulate the \nconnection between those defendants and the harms he claims to have suffered. \nRather, Plaintiff’s Complaint, as best the Court can understand it, fails to provide the \nnecessary detail required for claims under § 1983 to connect the defendants accused \nwith the harms alleged and relief requested.54 \ni. The City and Borough of Juneau  \nPlaintiff lists The City and Borough of Juneau as a defendant.  A local \ngovernmental entity, such as a city or county, may be a proper defendant in a § 1983 \naction.55  However, a local government entity is not liable under § 1983 simply \nbecause its employees violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.56   \n \n51 McHenry v.

Instead, Plaintiff makes naked assertions that \nDefendant Reid and other unknown John Doe defendants acted pursuant to “normal \npractice and procedure,” and that Defendant Juneau failed to train, supervise, and \ndiscipline police officers.61  Such naked assertions do not make Defendant Juneau a \nproper defendant in this case. \nPlaintiff’s Complaint may be asserting either the existence of a policy of \ninadequate training or supervision or the existence of a custom of tolerance or \n \n57 Villegas v.

To the \nextent that Plaintiff includes this information to establish a pattern of conduct by \nDefendant Reid or a custom and practice within the City and Borough of Juneau, \nPlaintiff must allege facts that Defendant Reid acted pursuant to either (1) an \nexpressly adopted official policy, or (2) a longstanding practice or custom. Plaintiff \nmust articulate specifically what that policy or custom is and how Defendant Reid’s \nactions constitute sufficient duration, frequency and consistency such that the \nconduct has become a traditional method of carrying out policy”63 as opposed to a \nsingle incident of unconstitutional activity, or even a series of “isolated or sporadic \nincidents,” which are insufficient to impose liability under § 1983.64   \nPlaintiff does not do that in his Complaint. Instead, Plaintiff merely takes issue \nwith how an officer or officers acted during his arrest without specifying any specific \npolicy or custom of training that was inadequate.  This deficiency warrants \ndismissal.  \nii. John Does 1-10 \nThe caption of Plaintiff’s Complaint lists “John Does 1-10.”  In a § 1983 suit, \nthe “plaintiff may refer to unknown defendants as \nDefendant John Doe 1, John Doe 2, John Doe 3, and so on, but he must [also] allege \nspecific facts showing how each particular Doe defendant violated his rights.”65  It \n \n62 Id.  \n63 Trevino v.

The Court is unable to \ndiscern who the “John Does” are that Plaintiff is seeking to sue. Plaintiff describes \nacts by Defendant Reid and speaks generally throughout the Complaint of \nDefendants in the plural but provides no information that would allow the Court or \npotential defendants to identify these unknown “John Does” through discovery or to \nassess their liability.

Accordingly, \nthe claims against “John Does 1-10” are deficient and are dismissed. However, the \nCourt grants Plaintiff leave to amend his Complaint as to these “John Does” with \nspecificity. \niii. Juneau Police Officer Reid \nGenerally, police officers are considered state actors for purposes of § 1983. \nPlaintiff broadly faults Defendants, including Defendant Reid for violating his rights \nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as well as his First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and \nFourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution.71 To the best of \nthe Court’s interpretation, Plaintiff faults Defendant Reid in a variety of claims \nstemming from a “vindictive prosecution and battery that occurred with an unlawful \narrest on September 25, 2020 in the City and Borough of Juneau Alaska.”72  In \naddition, Plaintiff alleges Defendant Reid planted fabricated evidence and refused \nhim medical assistance in a retaliatory and discriminatory manner.73 \nWhile Plaintiff raises many different claims against Defendant Reid, he does \nnot meet the required elements for those claims. Each claim has different pleading \nrequirements.  The Court attempts below to identify each of the deficiencies in \nPlaintiff’s Complaint as they relate to Defendant Reid.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiff must more clearly indicate whether he wishes to sue \nDefendant Reid in his individual or official capacity and seek the corresponding form \nof relief.  In a § 1983 action, a defendant may be sued in either an individual or an \nofficial capacity.  For a defendant to be individually liable under § 1983, that \n \n71 Doc. 1 at 4.  \n72 Id. at 2.  \n73 Id. \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 14 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v. City and Borough of Juneau, et al.  \n1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR  15  \n defendant must personally participate in an alleged rights deprivation.74  “In a \n§ 1983 action, the plaintiff must also demonstrate that the defendant’s conduct was \nthe actionable cause of the claimed injury.”75  A defendant sued in their individual \ncapacity may be held liable for money damages.76    \nAlternatively, in a § 1983 action, a plaintiff may sue a defendant in an official \ncapacity as an alternate way of pleading a claim against the governmental entity for \nwhich that individual is an officer or employee.77  A plaintiff suing a defendant in \ntheir official capacity is not required to allege the “named official’s personal \ninvolvement in the acts or omissions constituting the alleged constitutional \nviolation.”78  Instead, a plaintiff must only (1) “identify the law or policy challenged” \nand (2) “name the official within the entity who can appropriately respond to \ninjunctive relief.”79  However, a defendant sued in their official capacity may not be \nsued for damages, only for injunctive relief.80 \nIt should be noted that some of Plaintiff’s claims against Defendant Reid \nappear to be outside the applicable statute of limitations.  Section 1983 does not \ncontain its own statute of limitations. Rather, federal courts “apply the forum state’s \nstatute of limitations for personal injury actions, ... except to the extent any of these \nlaws is inconsistent with federal law.”81  In Alaska, the statute of limitations for a \ntort action against a peace officer is two years.82 \nHowever, the statute of limitations can be tolled while claims challenging an \nunconstitutional conviction or sentence are challenged in state court.

City and Borough of Juneau, et al.  \n1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR  16  \n opens two main avenues to relief on complaints related to imprisonment:  a petition \nfor habeas corpus and a civil rights complaint.83 Claims challenging “the fact or \nduration of the conviction or sentence” are within the core of habeas, while claims \nchallenging “any other aspect of prison life” are properly brought as civil rights \nactions.84 “[H]abeas is the exclusive vehicle for claims brought by state prisoners \nthat fall within the core of habeas corpus, and such claims may not be brought in a \n§ 1983 [civil rights] action.”85  \nIn Heck v. Humphrey , the Supreme Court held that “in order to recover \ndamages for [an] allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for \nother harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or \nsentence invalid, a § 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has \nbeen reversed on direct appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a \nstate tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a \nfederal court's issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2254.”86  “A claim for \ndamages bearing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that has not been ... \ninvalidated is not cognizable under § 1983.”87  “Thus, when a state prisoner seeks \ndamages in a § 1983 suit, the district court must consider whether a judgment in \nfavor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or \nsentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can \ndemonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.”88 \nIn Roberts v. City of Fairbanks ,  the Ninth Circuit, pointing to the Supreme \nCourt's holding in Heck, held that “a § 1983 action challenging a conviction or \nsentence does not ‘exist[ ]’ until the conviction or sentence is \n \n83 See Muhammad v.

Plaintiff did not file the present Complaint until April 11, 2023, more than two \nand half years later.  Any claims by Plaintiff regarding his short detention in jail, and \nany other claims that would not necessarily have invalidated his pending charges  \nshould have been brought within the two-year statute of limitations and are now \ntime barred.   \nHowever, Plaintiff’s claims regarding unconstitutional seizure, wrongful \narrest, and vindictive prosecution could not have been brought under § 1983 while \nhis criminal case was pending.91  Therefore, the stature of limitations was tolled as \nto those claims and did not start running until his charges were dismissed on June 1, \n2021.92   Accordingly, because Plaintiff filed this action on April 11, 2023,  his claims \nthat could have invalidated his charges do not appear to be time barred. \nc. First Amendment Claims \nNone of Plaintiff’s specific claims allege a violation of his First Amendment \nrights.  Nonetheless, Plaintiff does make a general claim of such a violation.  Viewing \nhis complaint liberally, Plaintiff may be asserting that that Defendant engaged in \nunlawful retaliation against him in violation of his First Amendment rights.  The \nCourt has identified in Plaintiff’s Complaint only two allegations in support of this \npossible claim. First, that Defendants refused to render medical assistance to him;93 \n \n89 Roberts v. City of Fairbanks , 947 F.3d 1191, 1200 (9th Cir. 2020); Rosales-Martinez v. \nPalmer, 753 F.3d 890, 896 (9th Cir. 2014). \n90 Id.  \n91 Claims that may have invalidated his pending charges could have been brought under \nhabeas while Plaintiff was “in custody.” See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241(c), 2254(a), 2255. \n92 As previously noted, Defendant states his charges were dismissed on July 15, 2021, \nhowever the Docket available to the Court suggests his charges were dismissed June 1, 2021. \n93 Doc. 1 at 2. \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 17 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v.

Discrimination \nTo prove discrimination in violation of § 1983 under the Fourteenth \nAmendment’s Equal Protection Clause, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the \nindividual  defendant acted with the intent to discriminate,154 and allege facts \nshowing how those defendants caused or personally participated in causing the \nharm alleged in the complaint.155  For such claims, proof of invidious discriminatory \npurpose is required for a claim of racial discrimination.156  \nLike Plaintiff’s First Amendment retaliation claim, Plaintiff offers sparce facts \nrelated to his discrimination claim. As the Court reads Plaintiff’s Complaint, he \nmakes three assertions.  First, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants profiled and harassed \nPlaintiff “on a number of occasions over a period of time stemming to the present.”157 \nSecond, Plaintiff states that Defendants refused to render medical assistance to him \nas a form of discrimination.158 Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants knowingly, \nwillingly, and intentionally covered up a pedestrian car accident in a road \nconstruction zone as a form of discrimination, thereby causing Plaintiff’s soft tissue \nright knee injury.159 \nPlaintiff’s Complaint in its current form is insufficient.  This is so because \nPlaintiff’s Complaint merely offers “naked assertions [about his discriminatory \ntreatment that are] devoid of further factual enhancement.”160  Plaintiff must plead \nfacts supporting the required elements and indicate what type of discrimination he \nfaced to sufficiently plead his Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection \n \n154 Daniels v.

Supplemental Jurisdiction and State Law Claims \nIn his Third and Fourth Claims, Plaintiff raises claims under Alaska State Law. \nSpecifically, in Claim Three, Plaintiff raises a battery claim against all Defendants \nstemming from his underlying criminal charges. Plaintiff claims that Defendants \nacted “violently, forcefully and without consent by placing plaintiff in a Court \nholding cell” with a pre-existing soft-tissue injury without providing medical \nattention first after a pedestrian-car accident.161 Battery claims are not found in the \nConstitution, nor as federal statutory rights. Instead, these claims are tort claims \nground in state law and most typically addressed in Alaska state court. \nSimilarly, Plaintiff’s Fourth Claim of Intentional Infliction of Emotional \nDistress against all Defendants is also ground in state law and most typically \naddressed in Alaska state court. Plaintiff claims he feared for his life after “being \nhandcuffed in the back seat of a police car with no identifiable voice” on September \n25, 2020.162  Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress claims are not found in the \nConstitution, nor as federal statutory rights.  Although AS 09.10.070(a) does not \nexplicitly include claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress, it includes \n“libel, slander, assault, battery, ... personal injury,” and other torts like intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress. \nIn civil actions in which federal district courts have original jurisdiction, “the \ndistrict courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so \nrelated to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part \nof the same case or controversy.”163 But a district court may decline to exercise \nsupplemental jurisdiction over a claim if “the district court has dismissed all claims \n \n161 Id. at 14.   \n162 Id. at 17.  \n163 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). \nCase 1:23-cv-00002-SLG-KFR   Document 10   Filed 08/25/23   Page 32 of 351 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n Screening Order  \nColeman v.

Plaintiff’s Complaint fails to sufficiently \narticulate the necessary facts for the Court to conclude that there is a claim against \nthe named defendants upon which relief can be granted.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Margaret L. Gauthier filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and stay of a receivership order, both initially and as amended. Her submissions contained significant miscitations, which the court attributed to potential misuse of AI software for drafting. The court denied the motions, finding Gauthier failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, favorable balance of equities, or public interest. AI was involved in the case as the alleged source of errors in Gauthier's legal submissions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Margaret L. Gauthier demonstrated sufficient cause for the issuance of a temporary restraining order and stay of the receivership order, considering errors in her legal filings purportedly influenced by AI-generated content.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Gauthier's amended emergency motion for a TRO and stay of receivership order, ruling that she failed to establish the necessary factors for such relief, including the likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm. Additionally, the public interest and balance of equities did not favor her request.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're playing a game, and one player wants to pause everything because they think they can win if the rules are clarified. However, their arguments are filled with mistakes, some possibly from a computer helper they used. The referee (court) checks and decides the game continues because the player didn't convincingly show they would win, they'd be harmed without a pause, or that pausing would be fair for everyone. The computer's role in making mistakes in the player's reasons didn't help their case either.",

On November 22, 2024, the Court issued an order \ndenying the Defendant’s emergency motion  without prejudice .  Order on Emergency Case 2:23-cv-00380-JAW     Document 91     Filed 11/26/24     Page 1 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n Mot. for Stay of Receivership Order and Mot. for Temporary Restraining Order (ECF \nNo. 85)  (Order on Def.’s First Emergency Mot. ). \nIn reviewing Ms. Gauthier’s emergency motion, the Court noticed the motion \ncontained numerous and egregious misquotations and miscitations.  Order to Show \nCause at 3-6 (ECF No. 83).  The errors did not appear to be typographical , and the \nCourt suspected they may owe to the Defendant’s reliance on Artificial Intelligence \nsoftware  in drafting  her motions.  Id. at 7-8.  Upon further review, the Court found \nthis was not the first time Ms. Gauthier  included miscitations in her submissions.  \nId. at 6-7.  On Novem ber 22, 2024, the Court ordered Ms. Gauthier to show cause \nwithin seven days as to why she should not be subject to sanctions and a Cok filing \nrestriction for these alarming  miscitations.  Id. at 8-10.   \nOn November 2 4, 2024, Ms. Gauthier submitted an amended emergency \nmotion for TRO and stay, which she avers “corrects the errors in Defendant’s original \nsubmission, ensures that all cited authorities are verified, and demonstrates the \nnecessity of granting the requested relief.”  Def.’s Am. Emergency Mot. for TRO  and \nStay of Receivership Order (ECF No. 87) ( Def.’s Am. Emergency Mot. ).  The amended \nemergency motion “renew[s] [the Defendant’s] request for a temporary restraining \norder based on new and verified  arguments.”  Id. at 1.  \nAs the Court explained  in its order denying Ms. Gauthier’s first emergency \nmotion for TRO and stay,  “[a] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic \nremedy that is never awarded as of right.”  Peoples Fed. Sav. Bank v. People’s United \nBank , 672 F.3d 1, 8- 9 (1st Cir. 2012)  (quoting Voice of the Arab World, Inc. v. MDTV Case 2:23-cv-00380-JAW     Document 91     Filed 11/26/24     Page 2 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n Med. News Now, Inc. , 645 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2011)) .  “In order for a court to grant \nthis type of relief, a plaintiff ‘must establish [1] that he is likely to succeed on the \nmerits,  [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary \nrelief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that the injunction is \nin the public interest.”  Id. (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. \n7, 20 (2008)).   “The party seeking the preliminary injunction bears  the burden of \ndemonstrating that these four factors weigh in its favor.”  Esso Standard  Oil Co. v. \nMonroig -Zayas, 445 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2006).  “[T]rial courts have wide discretion \nin making judgments regarding the appropriateness of” preliminary injunctive relief.  \nSanchez v. Esso Standard Oil Co. , 572 F.3d 1, 14 (1st Cir. 2010).  \nThe Court denied Ms. Gauthier’s first emergency motion upon concluding that \nthe Defendant had not met her burden to show any of these four factors weighed in \nher favor.  Order on Def.’s First Emergency Mot. at 8-14.  On the question of Ms. \nGauthier’s likelihood of success on the merits, the Court directed the Defendant to its sixty -five-page omnibus order, issued on November 19, 2024.  Omnibus Order (ECF \nNo. 78).  In her first emergency motion, Ms. Gauthier  had proffered her likelihood of \nsuccess on the mer its based on alleged jurisdictional and standing defects.   Def.’s First \nEmergency Mot. at 4 -5.  The Court concluded in its order on Ms. Gauthier’s first \nemergency motion that it had already addressed these legal claims  in its omnibus \norder and that this factor did not weigh in the Defendant’s favor.  Order on Def.’s First Emergency Mot. at 9-11.  The  Court also concluded Ms. Gauthier had not shown \nshe stood to suffer irreparable harm from the receivership order, noting “[t] he record Case 2:23-cv-00380-JAW     Document 91     Filed 11/26/24     Page 3 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n contains little indication of any specific irreparable harm that is likely to result if the \nCourt denies the motion for a TRO and stay” and “[t]he Court has a hard time seeing \nhow Mr. Campo’s authority as receiver could cause irreparable damage not \nredress able through money damages.”  Id. at 12.  Finally, t he Court determined  the \nbalance of the equities and the public interest, the latter not addressed by Ms. \nGauthier in her first emergency motion, did not cut in the Defendant’s favor.  Id. at \n13-14. \nThe Court comes to the same conclusion in response to the Defendant’s \namended emergency motion for TRO and stay.  First, the Court again concludes the \nDefendant has not shown her likelihood of success on the merits.  In her amended motion, the Defendant avers “there is insufficient evidence that the Plaintiff holds \nthe necessary legal interest to appoint a receiver an d take control of Defendant’s \nproperty.”  Def.’s Am. Emergency Mot. at 3 (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment , 523 U.S. 83, 101 (1998)).  The Court has addressed Ms. Gauthier’s \narguments regarding standing multiple times , concluding the Plaintiff has complied \nwith its pretrial obligations pursuant to Bank of America, N.A. v. Greenleaf , 2014 ME \n89, 96 A.3d 700.  See, generally, Omnibus Order; Order on Def.’s First Emergency Mot. \nat 8 -11.  Ms. Gauthier’s newly cited case, Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnvironment , does not address or allude to receivership appointments  and thus fails \nto provide a cognizable basis for the Court to change its conclusion in its order on the \ncurrent motion .   Case 2:23-cv-00380-JAW     Document 91     Filed 11/26/24     Page 4 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n More to the point, Ms. Gauthier seems stuck on her view that because she \nbelieves UMB does not have ownership of both the N ote and Mortgage for the loan in \nthis case, UMB does not have standing, and this Court is without jurisdiction \npursuant to Greenleaf .  Thus, Ms. Gauthier insists that the Court should dismiss the \nforeclosure complaint for lack of jurisdiction, and for support  she cites Steel Co. ’s \nadmonition that a court should not entertain “hypothetical jurisdiction” because \n“[h]ypothetical jurisdicti on produces nothing more than a hypothetical judgment.”  \n523 U.S. at 101.   \nThe problem with Ms. Gauthier’s often repeated argument is that UMB \ncontends that it has ownership and possession of the N ote and Mortgage in this case , \nand w hen Ms. Gauthier raised the question, Attorney Longoria filed affidavit s to \nconfirm that UMB possesses both  the Note and the M ortgage.  Aff. of Note Holder \n(ECF No. 27); Aff. in Resp. to Order to Clarify (ECF No. 35).  Based on these affidavits, \nthere is sufficient evidence before the Court so that it is well satisfied it has not \nassumed “hypothetical jurisdiction.”  Steel Co. , 523 U.S. at 101.   \nAs the Court has previously explained to Ms. Gauthier, UMB ’s affidavits carry \nthe day for the moment , and the Court will not dismiss the case on her say -so.  \nHowever, UMB still has the obligation to demonstrate that it has the ownership interest in both the promissory N ote and M ortgage in order to prevail at trial.  \nGreenleaf , 2014 ME 89, ¶ 9 (“Because foreclosure regards two documents —a \npromissory note and a mortgage securing that note—standing to foreclose involves \nthe plaintiff’s interest in both the note and the mortgage”).  To resolve this issue, the Case 2:23-cv-00380-JAW     Document 91     Filed 11/26/24     Page 5 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n Court has directed the Clerk of Court to schedule a trial and the docket states that \n“[t]he matter will be placed on the February 2025 trial list.  Ready for trial on \n2/3/2025.”  Notice (ECF No. 84).  At trial, UMB will be put to its proof, and if it fails \nto bear its burden of proof under Greenleaf , its foreclosure will fail.  But in view of \nAttorney Longoria’s affidavits, the Court’s assertion of jurisdiction based on the \ncurrent evidence is not the assertion of hypothetical jurisdiction.  To the contrary , the \nCourt’s refusal to accept continued jurisdiction would be t o assume (contrary to the \ncurrent evidence)  a hypothetical lack of jurisdiction.  Once again, t hese issues will be \nresolved at trial.   \nTurning to the risk of irreparable harm, the Court again come s to the same \nconclusion as in its order on Ms. Gauthier’s first emergency motion.  In her amended \nemergency motion, the Defendant asserts she stands to suffer irreparable harm because “[t]he receivership causes the following unnecessary and negative impacts”: \nloss of control over p roperty, tenant disruption, and reputational damage.  Def.’s Am. \nEmergency Mot . at 5-6.  She claims  “[c]ourts routinely recognize that the deprivation \nof property rights constitutes irreparable harm because monetary damages cannot \nadequately compensate for  such losses.”  Id. at 5 (citing Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347, \n373 (1976)).   \nThis citation is inapposite because the passage in Elrod that Ms. Gauthier cites \nlimits its holding to the risk of irreparable harm stemming specifically from a \nviolation of First Amendment rights.  Elrod , 427 U.S. at 373 (“The Court of Appeals \nheld . . . ‘Inasmuch as this case involves First Amendment rights of association which Case 2:23-cv-00380-JAW     Document 91     Filed 11/26/24     Page 6 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n must be carefully guarded against infringement by public office holders, we judge \nthat injunctive relief is clearly appropriate in these cases.’ . . ..  We agree.”).  Based \non a facially different context and underlying claim, t he Court does not believe Elrod  \nis relevant or persuasive to Ms. Gauthier’s case.  \nIn her amended emergency motion, Ms. Gauthier argues the balance of the \nequities favors the issuance of a TRO and stay.  Def.’s Am. Emergency Mot. at 6.  She \ncites SEC v. American Board of Trade, Inc. , 830 F.2d 431, 436 (2d Cir. 1987) , for the \nassertion  that “[c]ourts have recognized the importance of issuing TROs to stay \nreceiverships where jurisdictional and procedural issues remain unresolved” and \nstates , in that case,  “the court highlighted the need for strict scrutiny of receiverships \nto prevent unwarranted interference with property. ”  Def.’s Am. Emergency Mot. at \n6.  Ms. Gauthier’s characterization of the law  is incorrect.  The Second Circuit, which \ndoes not bind this Court, observed “courts have consistently held that such power [to appoint trustees or receivers] exists . . . where necessary to prevent the dissipation of \na defendant’s assets pending further a ction by the court.”   SEC v. Am. Bd. of Trade, \nInc., 830 F.2d at 436.  The Second Circuit additionally held that “[a]lthough we have \nwarned that ‘the appointment of trustees [or receivers] should not follow requests by \nthe SEC as a matter of course,’ . . . a district court’s decision to appoint a trustee or \nreceiver may be disturbed on appeal only if the district court has abused its \ndiscretion.”  Id.  (alteration in original).   Simply put, this case does not stand for the \npropositions Ms. Gauthier claims.  Furthermore, f or the same reasons the Court \ndiscussed in its order on the Defendant’s first emergency motion, see Order on Def.’s Case 2:23-cv-00380-JAW     Document 91     Filed 11/26/24     Page 7 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n First Emergency Mot. at 13- 14, the Court  conclude s Ms. Gauthier has not met her \nburden to establish the balance of the equities tilts in her favor.  \nFinally, t he Court conclude s the public interest does not favor a TRO or stay.  \nMs. Gauthier did not address the public interest in her first emergency motion but \nraises new arguments in her amended emergency motion.  In her amended motion, \nthe Defendant argues “[t]he public interest is best served by ensuring the fair and \nlawful resolution of disputes.”  Def.’s Am. Emergency Mot. at 7.  She proceeds to cite \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 429 (2009) , for the proposition that “the Supreme Court \nhas recognized  that preserving the status quo is an important consideration in \ngranting relief pending resolution of the merits” and in support of her argument that “[g]ranting the TRO would maintain the current state of affairs, preventing further \nharm to Defendant’s property rights and tenant relationships while the Court \nconsiders the underlying jurisdictional issues.”  Id.   \nThe Court finds this a n unhelpful interpretation of Nken.  In that case, the \nSupreme Court differentiated a stay from injunctive relief and held “[a] stay ‘simply \nsuspend[s] judicial alteration of the status quo,’ while injunctive relief ‘grants judicial \nintervention,’” Nken , 556 U.S. at 429 (quoting Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, \nInc. v. NRC , 479 U.S. 1312, 1313 (1986) ), and “[b]y seeking an injunction, applicants \nrequest that I issue an order altering the legal status quo,” id. (quoting Turner Broad.  \nSys., Inc. v. FCC , 507 U.S. 1301, 1302  (1993) (emphasis in original)).  In support of \nher argument that the public interest tilts in her favor, Ms. Gauthier additionally \nmisquotes United States Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization , 487 Case 2:23-cv-00380-JAW     Document 91     Filed 11/26/24     Page 8 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n U.S. 72, 76 (1988); the language Ms. Gauthier includes in quotation marks  that \n“[f]ederal courts have ‘the inherent and legitimate authority . . . to issue process only \nin aid of [their] jurisdiction ,’” Def.’s Am. Emergency Mot. at 7, does not appear in the \nSupreme Court’s decision.   \nThe Court DENIES  the Defendant’s Amended Emergency Motion for \nTemporary Restraining Order and Stay of Receivership Order (ECF No. 8 7).   \nSO ORDERED.  \n \n     /s/ John A.

The plaintiff, representing himself, claims Spotify is infringing his patent for a \"User-Defined Internet Jukebox.\" The dispute centers around Spotify's objections to Tijerino's discovery requests, which Tijerino argues are vague and boilerplate.

ECF No. 22 at 1.  \nOn March 3, 2025, Plaintiff propounded his fi rst set of requests for admission, \ninterrogatories, and requests for production.  EC F No. 42-3.  On April 2, 2025, Defendant served \nits responses with objections.  ECF No. 42-4.  On April 3, 2025, Plaintiff served a “meet-and-\nconfer letter,” asserting Defenda nt did not timely and adequate ly respond to his requests for \nadmission and that its objections in general are boilerp late and requesting s upplemental responses \nto all his discovery requests by April 10, 2025.  EC F No. 42-5.  Plaintiff did not explain why any \nparticular response was deficient nor did he attempt to schedule a conference.  \nOn April 11, 2025, the parties appear to have at tempted to confer only  as to Interrogatory \nNos. 1 and 2.  See ECF Nos. 44-2 at 5-6.  Plaintiff apparently  used an artificial intelligence program \nduring the conference to respond, ca using Defendant to have diffic ulty understanding his position, \nso the parties agreed that Defe ndant would send a further breakdow n of its objections by April 14, \n2025, after which Plaintiff would provide  specific responses to them.  See ECF No. 44-2 at 4-5 \n(Plaintiff’s email agreeing with Defendant’s summ ary of the April 11th conference).  However, on \nApril 12, 2025, Plaintiff filed his Motion to Compel Discovery Re sponses and to Deem Requests \nfor Admission Admitted or Compel Amended Response.  ECF No. 42.   \nIn his motion, Plaintiff argues that Defendant ’s responses to his requests for admission \ninclude qualified denials and  improper objections as they are boilerplate and vague.  ECF Nos. 42 \nat 2; 42-2 at 2.  Likewise, he argues Defendant’s  responses to his requ ests for production and \ninterrogatories include general and boilerplate obj ections.

ECF No. 44 \nat 14-15.  It argues Plaintiff fail ed to meet-and-confer  in good faith as re quired by Rule 37(a)(1) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure because Plaintiff was not prepared for the April 11, 2025, \nconference and only discussed Interrogatories Nos.  1 and 2, which they did not reach an impasse \non either.  Id.  Defendant further argues the motion does not specifically and i ndividually identify \neach discovery request in dispute and explain why Defendant’s respons es are deficient.  Id. at 15. \nDefendant also argues the motion is meritless as to the requests for admission because, after \npreserving its objections, it specifica lly admitted or denied every re quest, and as to the requests \nfor production and interrogatories because its objections are specific to each request and valid.  Id. \nat 16-17.  Defendant requests an award of the at torneys’ fees it incurred in opposing the motion \npursuant to Rule 37(a)(5)(B).  Id. at 17-18.  \nIn Reply, Plaintiff reiterates his argument th at Defendant’s objections  to his requests for \nadmission are improper.  ECF No. 45 at 4.  He also  argues he complied with Rule 37(a)(1)’s meet-\nand-confer requirement and that Rule 37 does not require him to explain why boilerplate objections \nmade to each request are deficient.  Id. at 4-5.  He argues Defendant  agreed it would not be \nproviding supplemental clarification as to the requests for admission.  Id. at 5.  Attached to the \nReply, Plaintiff provides his e xplanations as to why each of De fendant’s discovery responses are \ndeficient.  ECF No. 45-3.  II. APPLICABLE LAW \nA. Scope of Discovery \nRule 26 authorizes the partie s to “obtain discovery regard ing any nonprivilege d matter that \nis relevant to any party’s cla im or defense and proportional to th e needs of the case, considering \nthe importance of the issues at stake in the action , the amount in controversy, the parties’ relative Case 2:24-cv-02290-ILRL-DPC     Document 78     Filed 07/07/25     Page 3 of 144 \n access to relevant information, the parties’ resour ces, the importance of the discovery in resolving \nthe issues, and whether the burden or expense of  the proposed discover y outweighs its likely \nbenefit.  Information within th is scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be \ndiscoverable.”  F ED. R. C IV. P. 26(b)(1).  Rule 26(b)(2)(C) mandates that the Court limit the \nfrequency or extent of discovery otherwise allowe d if it determines: (1) the discovery sought is \nunreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or can be obtained from some other source that is more \nconvenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;  (2) the party seekin g discovery had ample \nopportunity to obtain the informatio n; or (3) the proposed discovery is outside the scope of Rule \n26(b)(1).2   \nThe relevancy evaluation necessarily begins with an examination of the pending claims \nand defenses.3  The threshold for relevance at the discovery stage is lower than the threshold for \nrelevance of admissibility of evidence at the trial stage.4  This broader scope is necessary given the \nnature of litigation, wh ere determinations of re levance for discovery pur poses are made well in \nadvance of trial.  Facts that are not considered in determining the u ltimate issues may be eliminated \nin due course of the proceeding.5  At the discovery stage, releva nce includes “[a]ny matter that \nbears on, or that reasonably could le ad to other matter that could b ear on, any issue that is or may \nbe in the case.”6  Discovery should be allowed unless the party opposing discovery establishes that \nthe information sought “can have no possible bearing on the claim or  defense of the party seeking \n \n2 FED.

F ED. R. C IV. P. 36(a)(1)(A).  The Fifth Circuit has \nexplained that Rule 36 allows litigants to requ est admissions as to a broad range of matters, \nincluding ultimate facts, as well as  applications of law to fact.24  Requests for admission are \nproperly used for facts or facts as applied to law, but not for pure legal conclusions.25  A legal-\nrelated request for admission must  connect the relevant legal pr oposition to specific facts and \ncircumstances of the case.26   \nRule 36 instructs litigants how to answer and object to requests for admission:   \nIf a matter is not admitted, the answer must  specifically deny it or  state in detail \nwhy the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly \nrespond to the substance of the matter; and when good fa ith requires that a party \nqualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the answer must specify the part \nadmitted and qualify or deny the rest. Th e answering party ma y assert lack of \nknowledge or information as a reason for failing to adm it or deny only if the party \nstates that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the informa tion it knows or can \nreadily obtain is insufficient to  enable it to admit or deny. \n \n \n22 Am.

When the court must resolve a dispute that  the parties themselves could have resolved, it \nmust needlessly expend resources that  it could better utilize elsewhere.”44  \n To ensure compliance with Rule 37(a)(1), this Court expressly requires the parties to \nprovide detailed informati on in the required Rule 37 certification, specifying:  \n(1) how the required conference was scheduled,  \n(2) who participated in the conference,  (3) the date and time of the conference,  (4) whether the conference was c onducted by phone or in person,  \n(5) the duration of the conference,  \n(6) the specific topics that were addressed at the conference, and  \n(7) whether any issues were resolved by the parties, a nd, if so, the terms of the \nresolution.\n45   \n \nThese instructions further direct that the “mee t and confer [must be] either in person or by \ntelephone, not simply via email exchange.”46  The conference requirements are no “empty \n \n43 See Williams v.

ECF No. 42-8.  However, based on \nDefendant’s summary of the conference and Plaint iff’s agreement with same, Plaintiff did not \nconfer in good faith as he was not prepared for the conference, choosing to outsource his positions \nto artificial intelligence.  See ECF No. 44-2 at 4-5.  Further, it viol ates the spirit of Rule 37 to agree \nto continue to try to resolve the discovery disput es after an initial conference and then immediately \nfile a motion the next day, as Plaintiff did.  Even if Plaintiff had co nferred in good faith, the \nconference only briefly addressed In terrogatories Nos. 1 and 2.  The failure to engage in a fulsome \nmeet and confer on each  disputed response, including the re quests for admission, prior to filing \nthe discovery motion constitutes sufficient  reason in itself to deny the motion.50  \n Courts have found technical compliance with Rule  37(a)(1) can be overridden when the \ncircumstances warrant, such as the futility of a conference or the discove ry’s potential impact on \npending deadlines.51  Plaintiff’s agreement to provide speci fic responses to Defendant’s objections \n \n47 Riverbend Env’t Servs., LLC v.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Plaintiff Tianqi Zhao, a former Ph.D. candidate in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's (RPI) Computer Science program, alleged racial discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, following disciplinary actions against her that led to her suspension and subsequent withdrawal from the program. The court dismissed the complaint because Zhao did not sufficiently demonstrate that RPI's actions were motivated by discriminatory intent related to her race or nationality. The case involved AI through an externship with IBM's Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration, which was canceled following Zhao's suspension.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether RPI's disciplinary actions against Zhao were motivated by racial discrimination, thus violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Zhao's complaint was dismissed because she failed to plausibly allege that RPI's actions were motivated by discriminatory intent related to her race or national origin. The court found her claims insufficient under Title VII as they did not establish a direct connection between the alleged adverse actions and racial bias.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of a school disciplining a student for breaking rules. The student says the punishment was unfair and based on her race. However, the court decides that there's not enough evidence showing the school punished her because of her race rather than her actions. So, her complaint is thrown out because she didn't provide enough proof that the school's actions were racially motivated.",

INTRODUCTION \nOn May  27, 2024, pro se Plaintiff Tianqi Zhao commenced this action against Defendant \nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute  (“RPI”), alleging a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, \n42 U.S.C. §§ 2000(e)1–3; Dkt. No. 1 (“Complaint”). On August 30, 2024, Defendant moved to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint and  to stay discovery pending the outcome of the motion to \ndismiss . Dkt. No. 10-1. (“Motion”). Plaintiff filed a response, Dkt. No. 20 (“Response”), and \nDefendant filed a reply, Dkt. No. 22. \nFor the reasons that follow, Defendant ’s motion to dismiss  is granted  and the motion to \nstay discovery is denied as moot.  II. BACKGROUND The following facts are set forth as alleged in the Complain t, as well as  the exhibits \nattached  to it, and papers  submitted in response to Defendant’s Motion. \nPlaintiff was a Ph.D. candidate in Defendant’s Computer Science doctoral program . \nCompl. ¶ 3. As part of her enrollment, Plaintiff was awarded tuition remission and an academic stipend. Dkt. No. 20-7 at 1 . In her admission letter , Defendant  “committed to supporting Case 1:24-cv-00703-LEK-MJK     Document 23     Filed 08/13/25     Page 1 of 92 [Plaintiff’s] academic studies . . . with financial support for up to a total of 4 years.” Id. \nDefendant noted, however, that “[a]ll  financial support is contingent upon [Plaintiff’s]  status as  a \nfull time student”  and “[t]he continuation of [Plaintiff’s financial support] is based on an annual \nreview of [Plaintiff’s] academic progress and completion of [her] duties.”  Id. \nDuring the 2021- 2022 academic year , Plaintiff  served as a Teaching Assistant . Resp. at 2. \nShe “was paid by [ Defendant ] on a bi -weekly  basis.” Id.  In March  2022, Plaintiff accepted an \nexternship with IBM  through Defendant ’s Artificial Intelligence Research Collaboration . Dkt. \nNo. 20- 6. The externship was to be performed at the direction of IBM , but a stipend was \nprovided by D efendant . Id. Her offer  letter stated that “[f]inancial support is contingent on \nsatisfactory academic performance in your assistantship duties and compliance with all \napplicable Rensselaer policies and procedures.” I d. \nOn April 27, 2022, Plaintiff was placed on probation. See Dkt. No. 20- 1 at 1. On May 25, \n2022, Plaintiff was placed on  interim suspension and instructed to comply with the “Persona Non \nGrata issued [] by the Department of Public Safety.” Dkt. No. 20- 5 at 1. Defendant explained that \nthe “disruptive nature of [Plaintiff’s] behavior [wa]s escalating,” which “constitue[d]  a threat of \ndanger to the security, health, or safety of the Rensselaer  community .” Id. On May 27, 2022, \nDefendant cancelled Plaintiff’s externship with IBM. Dkt. No. 20- 4. Defendant explained that \n“[the] interim suspension means, unfortunately, that [Plaintiff is] not in compliance with the policies and procedures” set forth in her externshi p offer letter. Id. ; see also  Dkt. No. 20- 6. \nPlaintiff posits that th is disciplinary action  was prompted by “ an anonymous complaint \nfor harassment ” filed by a staff member at the Defendant’s Dean of Students Office or the \nStudent Success Office.  Compl. ¶ 8.  Case 1:24-cv-00703-LEK-MJK     Document 23     Filed 08/13/25     Page 2 of 93 Defendant then initiated disciplinary proceedings against Plaintiff, which lasted three \nmonths. Compl. ¶ 10 . “[D]ue to the malicious delay of scheduling a hearing by the Dean of \nStudent[s],” Plaintiff  was unable to “keep the IBM extern job,” serve as a teaching assistant, or \n“attend networking events” for jobs in America. Resp. at 2 . \nPrior to a final determination from the disciplinary proceedings, Plaintiff informed \nDefendant that  she would “quit the Computer Science Ph.D. program ,” and graduate with a \nmaster’s  degree instead.  Dkt. No. 20- 3 at 1 . \nPlaintiff alleges that Defendant discriminated against her on the basis of her race when \n(1) she was presumed guilty , after the Dean of Students “trust[ed] the complaint filed by a White \nCaucasian staff,” and (2) Defendant intentionally disciplined Plaintiff to “force[] [her] to leave \nAmerica” because she is a “ Chinese citizen. ” Compl. ¶ ¶ 14–15.  \nPlaintiff  seeks compensatory damages  and to regain access to “normal communications \nwith all the faculty and staff in the Department of Computer Science.” Compl . at 3.  \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nTo survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a \n“complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that \nis plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). A court must accept as true the factual allegations \ncontained in a complaint and draw all inferences in favor of a plaintiff. See Allaire Corp. v. Okumus , 433 F.3d 248, 249–50 (2d Cir. 2006). A complaint may be dismissed pursuant to Rule \n12(b)(6) only where it appears that there are not “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570. Plausibility requires “enough fact[s] to raise a Case 1:24-cv-00703-LEK-MJK     Document 23     Filed 08/13/25     Page 3 of 94 reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [the alleged misconduct].” Id.  at \n556.  \nThe plausibility standard “asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has \nacted unlawfully.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556). The Supreme Court \nhas stated that “the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require ‘detailed factual \nallegations,’ but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully- harmed -me \naccusation.” Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555). “[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit \nthe court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,” the pleader has not \ndemonstrated that she is entitled to relief and the action is subject to dismissal. Id.  at 679. \nWhere, as here, a plaintiff proceeds pro se, the court must “construe the complaint \nbroadly, and interpret it to raise the strongest arguments that it suggests.” Weixel v. Bd. of Educ. \nof City of N.Y. , 287 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir. 2002) (cleaned up). Nevertheless, “dismissal of a pro \nse complaint is …appropriate where a plaintiff has clearly failed to meet the minimum pleading \nrequirements.” Rahman v. Schriro, 22 F.Supp.3d 305, 310 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citing Rodriguez v. \nWeprin , 116 F.3d 62, 65 (2d Cir. 1997)). The Court’s “duty to liberally construe a plaintiff’s \ncomplaint is not the equivalent of a duty to re- write it.” Geldzahler v. N.Y. Med. Coll., 663 F. \nSupp. 2d 379, 387 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (cleaned up). \nWhen ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, “ a district court must confine its consideration to \nfacts stated on the face of the complaint, in documents appended to the complaint or incorporated \nin the complaint by reference, and to matters of which judicial notice may be taken.” Leonard F. \nv. Isr. Disc. Bank of N.Y., 199 F.3d 99, 107 (2d Cir. 1999) ( internal quotations omitted ). \nHowever, for pro se plaintiffs , the Court may  consider “materials outside the complaint to the \nextent that they are consistent with the allegations in the complaint,” Alsaifullah v. Furco, No. Case 1:24-cv-00703-LEK-MJK     Document 23     Filed 08/13/25     Page 4 of 95 12-CV-2907, 2013 WL 3972514, at *4 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2013) (internal quotations \nomitted ), including, “documents that a pro se litigant attaches to his opposition papers,” Agu v. \nRhea , No. 09- CV-4732, 2010 WL 5186839, at *4 n.6 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 2010), “factual \nallegations made by a pro se party in his papers opposing the motion,” Walker v. Schult , 717 \nF.3d 119, 122 n.1 (2d Cir. 2013), and “documents that the plaintiff[ ] either possessed or knew \nabout and upon which [he or she] relied in bringing the suit,” Rothman v. Gregor , 220 F.3d 81, \n88 (2d Cir. 2000). Finally, “the sufficiency of a complaint is a matter of law that the court is \ncapable of determining based on its own reading of the pleading and knowledge of the law.” \nMcCall v. Pataki , 232 F.3d 321, 322–23 (2d Cir. 2000). \nIV. DISCUSSION  \nDefendant moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s Complaint in its entirety. First, Defendant argues \nthat Plaintiff’s allegations do not give rise to protection under Title VII  because her claims are \nbased on her status as a graduate student, not as an employee. Mot. at 5–8. Second, Defendant \nargues that  even if Title VII does apply, Plaintiff fails to state a claim for discrimination  because \nshe has failed to plausibly allege discriminatory intent. Mot. at 8–11.  \nA. Plaintiff’s Employee Status  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff cannot bring a claim under Title VII because “all of the \nactions taken by RPI [were] to address Plaintiff’s role as a graduate student,” and Title VII protections do not extend to actions beyond the employer- employee relatio nship. Mot. at 5–8. As \na threshold matter, Title VII protections are limited “to actions that affect employment or alter the conditions of the workplace.” Burlington N. & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White , 548 U.S. 53, 62 \n(2006)); see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e- 2(a). Therefore, “the existence of an employer -employee Case 1:24-cv-00703-LEK-MJK     Document 23     Filed 08/13/25     Page 5 of 96 relationship is a primary element of Title VII claims.” Gulino v. N.Y. State Educ. Dep’t , 460 F.3d \n361, 370 (2d Cir. 2006).  \nWhen a graduate student brings a claim under Title VII, the Court must determine \nwhether the claimed discrimination relates to the plaintiff’s role as a student or as an employee. \nSee Bucklen v. Rensselaer Polytechnic Inst. , 166 F. Supp. 2d 721, 725 (N.D.N.Y . 2001). Indeed, \ngraduate students serve a “unique dual role” as both students and employees.” Id.  “[I]n those \nsituations in which a plaintiff is both a ‘student’ and an ‘employee,’ courts have looked to the nature of the work that the individual perform ed, the relationship between the individual and the \neducational institution, and the focus of the institution’s challenged actions to determine if the claims the plaintiff asserts are cognizable under Title VII.” Lachaab v. Zimpher , No. 15- CV-426, \n2016 WL 3172869, at *4 (N.D.N.Y . June 6, 2016). The parameters of Title VII cannot be extended to “encompass purely academic decisions . . . that have only a tangential effect on one’s status as an employee.” Id. (quoting Bucklen , 166 F. Supp. 2d at 725). \nWhether Plaintiff was an employee during the relevant period or if RPI’s reprimands \nwere adverse employment action s require  a fact -intensive inquiry . Tagare v. Nynex Network  Sys. \nCo., 994 F. Supp. 149, 153 (S.D.N.Y . 1997)  (“[T] he determination of [Plaintiff]’ s employment \nstatus involves a detailed, fact -intensive inquiry of several factors .”); Ward v. Cohen Media \nPublications LLC , No. 22- CV-06431, 2023 WL 5353342, at *5 (S.D.N.Y . Aug. 21, 2023)  \n(“[D]etermining whether a party is an employee or an independent contractor is a fact -intensive \ninquiry .”). However,  the Court need not engage  in such an inquiry at this juncture. Assuming, \nwithout deciding, that Plaintiff is an employee  and RPI’s actions were adverse employment \nactions , her Title VII claim still fails because she has not plausibly alleged discriminatory animus  \non the part of Defendant. Case 1:24-cv-00703-LEK-MJK     Document 23     Filed 08/13/25     Page 6 of 97 B. Discriminatory Intent  \nPlaintiff alleges that the disciplinary actions RPI  took against her were motivated by the \nfact that she is a “Chinese citizen.” See Compl. ¶ ¶ 14–15. To make out  a claim for employment \ndiscrimination under Title VII, Plaintiff must show that  RPI discriminated against her  on the \nbasis of her race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. See Buon v. Spindler , 65 F.4th 64, 78 (2d \nCir. 2023) . Specifically, at the pleading stage, Plaintiff  must plead facts which demonstrate  she is \n“(1) is a member of a protected class, (2) was qualified  [for the role], (3) suffered an adverse \nemployment action, and (4) has at least minimal support for the proposition that the employer \nwas motivated by discriminatory intent.” Id . at 79 (cleaned up).  \nAs outlined above  in Part IV . A., the Court assumes arguendo that Plaintiff is an \nemployee and that RPI’s actions constituted adverse employment actions in the instant action. Moreover, Defendant does not appear to dispute that Plaintiff is a member of a protected class \nand that she was qualified for her role at RPI. See Mot. 8–11. Instead, to defeat Plaintiff’s claim, \nRPI avers that Zhao has not sufficiently plead “ any factual allegations to allow an inference of \ndiscrimination.” Id . at 9  (emphasis added). Thus, the Court will focus on the fourth prong of the \nanalysis : whether Plaintiff has plausibly alleged discriminatory intent. She has not. \n“In this Circuit, the ‘ sine qua non’  of a national origin or race -based discrimination suit is \nthat the ‘ discrimination must be because of  [the p laintiff’s protected characteristic].” Buon, 65 \nF.4th at 82 (alteration in original)  (quoting Patane v. Clark , 508 F.3d 106, 112 (2d Cir. 2007) ). \nThe words “because of” are important  — Title VII  requires a showing that “a plaintiff’s race . . . \nwas a ‘substantial’ or ‘motivating’ factor contributing to the employer’s  decision to take the  \n[adverse] action.” Vega , 801 F.3d at 85. The Second Circuit has advised district courts to “be \nmindful of the ‘ elusive ’ nature of intentional discrimination” at the pleadin g stage because Case 1:24-cv-00703-LEK-MJK     Document 23     Filed 08/13/25     Page 7 of 98 “rarely is there direct, smoking gun, evidence of discrimination.” Id . at 86 ( internal quotations \nomitted ). Thus, Plaintiff  need only “give plausible support to a minimal inference of \ndiscriminatory motivation.” See Littlejohn v. City of New York , 795 F.3d 297, 311 (2d Cir. 2015). \nYet Plaintiff’s allegations fall woefully below that standard. Here, Plaintiff merely \nasserts, in conclusory fashion, that Defendant  discriminated against her based on her race and \nnational origin. See Compl. ¶¶ 13–15. She does not allege any facts suggesting that her \nsuspension, loss of access to campus and internship opportunities, or termination from her Ph.D. program were motivated by her being Asian or Chinese. Instead, Plaintiff’s own documents  make \nclear that the adverse actions she experienced arose from complaints about her conduct at RPI  \nand the resulting disciplinary process . See Compl. ¶¶ 4–7, 9–12; Dkt. No. 20- 1 at 1; Dkt. No. 20-\n2; Dkt. No. 20- 5. Thus, the failure to connect any of Defendant’s adverse actions to  racial animus \nis fatal to Plaintiff’s claims . See Soloviev v. Goldstein, 104 F. Supp. 3d 232, 250 (E.D.N.Y . 2015) \n(dismissing a Title VII discrimination claim because the events leading up to  “[Plaintiff’s] \ndischarge indicate [] that his termination was the product of his actions rather than his race . . . or \nnational origin.”).  \nAccordingly, Plaintiff’s Title VII claim is dismissed for failure to state a claim upon \nwhich relief may be granted.  Defendant’s Motion is granted.  \nC. Motion to Stay Discovery Because Defendant’s motion to dismiss is granted in its entirety, Defendant’s motion to \nstay discovery is denied as moot . \nV. CONCLUSION Accordingly, it is hereby:  Case 1:24-cv-00703-LEK-MJK     Document 23     Filed 08/13/25     Page 8 of 99 ORDERED, that Defendant’s motion to dismiss , Dkt.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this court case, several former Kentucky State Police troopers, including Thomas Czartorski and others, face charges for multiple incidents involving excessive use of force and a cover-up of one such incident. The defendants filed motions to sever their trials, arguing various grounds as to why they should be tried separately, with the court deciding to hold a hearing to further explore these issues. Notably, one defense attorney cited non-existent judicial opinions, allegedly due to reliance on AI-generated citations, prompting the court to order a separate hearing to address potential sanctions for these ethical breaches.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The main legal issue is whether the counts and defendants in the case are properly joined under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 8 and 14, and if not, whether they should be severed to prevent prejudice against the defendants.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court has not made a final holding on the motions to sever but has ordered a hearing to discuss the joinder issues, and separately address counsel’s improper use of AI-generated citations.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have three kids (defendants) who got into four different kinds of big trouble on different days (incidents of excessive force). The police (prosecutors) want to talk to them about everything all at once, but two of the kids think that they should only talk about their own messes separately, without getting mixed up with the others. Meanwhile, one of the kids' adults (lawyer) told some made-up stories (cited fake cases) to help them out, and now the grown-ups (court) are upset and want to talk to this adult about it.",

Criminal  Action No. 3:25-CR-00030 -RGJ \n  \nTHOMAS CZARTORSKI, ET AL . Defendants  \n \n*  *  *  *  *  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER  \n This ma tter is before the Court o n the motions to sever filed by Defendants James Cameron \nWright  (“Wright ”) [DE 55] and Defendant Jarrod Lewis ( “Lewis ”) [DE 59] . The United States of \nAmerica ( “United States ”) responded [DE 58; DE 64 ] and Lewis replied [DE 69].  These matters \nare ripe. For the reasons below , the Court ORDERS  a hearing on  the matters discussed herein . \nI. BACKGROUND  \nDefendants Wright, Lewis, and Thomas Czartorski  (“Czartorski ” and, collectively with \nWright and Lewis, “Defendants ”) were  Kentucky State Police ( “KSP”) Troopers  at all relevant \ntimes . [See DE 1  (the “Indictment ”)]. This case relates to  four separate use -of-force incidents  and \nan alleged cover -up of one of those  incidents, each involving one or more of the Defendants . [Id.]. \nOn March 4, 2025, a grand jury returned an indictment charging five counts of “Deprivation of \nRights Under Color of Law ” in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 242  (Counts 1 –5) and one co unt of \n“Perjury ” in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623  (Count 6 ). [Id.]. The acts giving rise to the charges  in \nthe indictment are summarized below.  \nMarch 2020 Use-of-Force Incident . “On or about March 5, 2020, ” Wright, Lewis, and \nCzartorski arrested  Alleged V ictim 1. [Id. at 1–2]. Counts 1, 2, and 3 of the Indictment charge each \nDefendant with “willfully depriv[ing] [Alleged] Victim 1 of the right . . . to be free from an \nunreasonable seizure, which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable fo rce by a Case 3:25-cr-00030-RGJ     Document 73     Filed 11/10/25     Page 1 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n law enforcement officer. ” [Id.]. Specifically, Defendants  allegedly “stomped and [/or] kicked ” \nAlleged Victim 1 . [Id.]. \nApril 2020 Use -of-Force Incident.  Czartorski  arrested Alleged Victim 2  “[o]n or about April \n3, 2020 .” [Id. at 3].  Count 4 of the  Indictment alleges that Czartorski “willfully deprived [Alleged] \nVictim 2 of the right . . . to be free from an unreasonable seizure, which includes the right to be \nfree f rom the use of unreasonable force by a law enforcement officer ” by “str[iking] [Alle ged] \nVictim 2 about the legs and torso with a flashlight, without legal justification. ” [Id.].  \nJanuary 2021 Alleged Perjury . Count 6 of the Indictment alleges that “[o]n or about January \n22, 2021, ” Wright “knowingly made false material declaration s . . . while being deposed, under \noath, in connection with a [civil rights case] ” arising from Wright ’s use of force while arresting  \nAlleged Victim 4 on “April  9, 2020. ” [Id. at 4]. Although Wright testified that he did not strike \nAlleged Victim 4, the In dictment alleges that Wright “knew and believed ” that he “did in fact \nstrike and use force on [Alleged] Victim 4 during his arrest. ” [Id. at 5].  \nMarch 2024  Use-of-Force Incident.  Finally, “[o]n or about March 12, 2024, ” Wright \narrested Alleged Victim 3 and , similar to the other charges  under 18 U.S.C. § 242 , is alleged in \nCount 5 to have  employed  unreasonable force  by “tas[ing]  [Alleged] Victim 3 without legal \njustification .” [Id. at 3–4].  \nAs relevant  here, the sole charge against Lewis  (Coun t 2) arises from the March 2020 \nincident , for which Wright and Czartorski were also charged  (Counts 1 and 3) . And from the face \nof the Indictment,  it appears that the remaining charges  against Wright (Counts 5 and 6)  and \nCzartorski (Count 4) involve  only one D efendant  and separate Alleged Victims . Nevertheless, \nLewis ’ Motion indicates that “[t]he April 9, 2020 incident also involved Mr. Czartorski. ” [DE 59 \nat 266]. As a result,  it is unclear from the statements in  the Indic tment whether the allegations Case 3:25-cr-00030-RGJ     Document 73     Filed 11/10/25     Page 2 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n pertaining to events “on or about ” April 3, 2020 and April 9, 2020, refer to the same or separate \nincidents. [ See DE 1 at 3, 5].  \nWright and Lewis now move to sever , although on separate grounds . Wright objects to the \njoinder of multiple counts against him in the same trial and requests that the Court “sever Counts \n3, 5 and 6 of the Indictment and order that each Count against the Defendant be tried separately \nby the Government. ” [DE 55 at 235]. Lewis obj ects to the joinder of his codefendants and asks the \nCourt to “sever this case among the three Defendants, so that each defendant may be tried \nseparately ,” [DE 59 at 264] , or, in the alternative, “order a separate trial on  the single count in \nwhich [ he] is charged. ” [DE 69 at 30 4].   \nII. STANDARD  \nJoinder of offenses  and defendants are subject to  Rules 8 and 14 of the Federal Rules of \nCriminal Procedure. Rule 8 provides the requirements for joining offenses and defendants in the \nsame indictment : \n(a) Joinder of Offenses.  The indictment  or information may charge a defendant in \nseparate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses charged --whether felonies \nor misd emeanors or both --are of the same or similar character, or are based on the \nsame act or transaction, or are connected with or  constitute parts of a common \nscheme or plan.  \n \n(b) Joinder of Defendants.  The indictment or information may charge 2 or more \ndefend ants if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction, or \nin the same series of acts or transactions, constituting an offense or offenses. The \ndefendants may be charged in one or more counts together or separately. All \ndefendants nee d not be charged in each count.  \n \nFed. R. Crim. P. 8. Rule 14  provides that even if joinder is proper under Rule 8, the Court may \nchoose to sever charges or defendants under Rule 14 ( “Relief from Prejudicial Joinder ”) if a joint \ntrial would prejudice one or  more defendants : Case 3:25-cr-00030-RGJ     Document 73     Filed 11/10/25     Page 3 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n (a) Relief.  If the joinder of offenses or defendants in an indictment, an information, \nor a consolidation f or trial appears to prejudice a defendant or the government, the \ncourt may order separate trials of counts, sever the defendants ’ trials, or provide \nany other relief that justice requires.  \n \nFed. R. Crim. P. 14(a).  \nIn United States v. Hatcher , 680 F.2d 438  (6th Cir.  1982), the Sixth Circuit articulated the \nstandard for joinder under Rule 8(b) as follows:  \nThe joinder of multiple defendants is proper under Rule 8(b) only if each of the \ncounts of the indictment arises out of the same act or transaction or seri es of acts or \ntransactions, even if all counts of the indictment include a common defendant.  \n \nId. at 441 (citation m odified). “[A] group of acts or transactions constitutes a ‘series ’ if they are \nlogically interrelated. ” United States v. Johnson , 763 F.2d 773, 775–77 (6th Cir.  1985)  (explaining \nRule 8(b) requires a “a sufficient nexus exists between the defendants and t he single or multiple \nacts or transactions charged as offenses ”).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Motions to Sever  \nWhen an indictment charges multiple defendant s, joinder may be challenged under either \nRule 8(b) or Rule 14 . “Although the remedy for misjoinder under Rule 8[] and  prejudicial joinder \nunder Rule 14 is the same —severance and separate trials —the two rules are  analytically and \nprocedurally distinct. ” United States v. Lloyd , 10 F.3d 1197, 1214 (6th Cir. 1993).  Rule 14 is the \nprejudicial joinder rule. “Rule 14 com es into  play only if joinder was initially proper under Rule 8 \nbut a joint trial would prejudice one or more  defendants. ” Lloyd , 10 F.3d at 1214.  Thus, the Court \nfinds it appropriate to first  consider  whether joinder of Lewis was proper under Rule 8(b)  before \nreaching Wright ’s argument that severance is warranted under Rule  14.  Case 3:25-cr-00030-RGJ     Document 73     Filed 11/10/25     Page 4 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 According to Lewis, “[t]he operative question in this case . . . is whether ‘each of the counts \nof the indictment arises out of the same act or transaction or series of acts or transactions. ” [DE 59 \nat 268 (citing  Hatcher  680 F.2d  at 441)].  Lewis  concludes  “[t]hey  clearly  do not. ” [Id.]. In \nre\nsponse,  the United States  asserts  that the “controlling  test for  whether  acts or transactions \noc\ncurring  at different  times  and against  different  victims  form  a joinable  ‘series ’ of offenses  is \nwhe\nther the distinct  acts  are ‘logically  interrelated. ’” [DE  64 at  286 (quoting  United States  v. \nCousins , 841 F. App ’x 885, 893 (6th Cir. 2021))]. And while the United States concedes that the \nIndictment  “does not charge  a conspiracy  or allege  a common  scheme  or plan,  it does  allege  a \nseries  of logically-related  criminal  acts  by Defendant  Wright,  and  that  Defendant  Lewis \nparticipated in one of those crimes.”  [Id.] \nBased on the parties’ briefings, however, the Court believes that hearing is necessary on \ncertain issues before disposing of Lewis’ Motion.  \nFirst, there are no allegations on the face of the Indictment directly connecting Count 4 to \nWright. Only Czartorski is charged in connection to the April 3, 2020 incident involving Alleged \nVictim 2, and there is no mention of Wright in the charged facts. While it is true that Rule 8 is a \n“pleading rule ” in which a court only examines “the allegations on the face of the indictment,”  see \nUnited States v. Cousins , 841 F. App ’x at 893, it is also true that “Rule 8(b) should be construed \nto favor  joinder  in order  to promote judicial  economy. ” Johnson , 763 F.2d  at 776. Here,  the \nIndictment alleges that Wright was involved in the  arrest of Alleged “Victim 4 ” on “April 9, 2020, ” \nduring an incident which apparently involved Czartorski. [ Compare DE 1 at 4, with DE 59 at 266 \n(explaining that “[t]he April 9, 2020 incident also involved Mr. Czartorski ” but that “[o]nly Mr. \nWright is charged . . . in connection with Incident #4”)] . The Court cannot determine whether the \nallegations pertaining to events “on or about ” April 3, 2020 and April 9, 2020, refer to the same or Case 3:25-cr-00030-RGJ     Document 73     Filed 11/10/25     Page 5 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 separate incidents. [ See DE 1 at 3, 5]. If these  allegations  refer to the same incident, a superseding \nindictment could  be required to  satisfy Rule 8(b) . However, the parties ’ briefs do not squarely  \naddress this issue .  \nSecond, although Lewis ’ Motion asks the Court to sever each Defendant, the United States \nsuggests that the Court “can afford complete  and appropriate relief by simply ordering a separate \ntrial of the single count against Defendant  Lewis. ” [DE 64 to 291]. And in hi s reply, Lewis “agrees \nthat the other two co -defendants have not  requested severance under Rule 8(b) and therefore agrees \nwith that approach .” [DE 69 at 298 –99]. When determining “whether joinder would serve the goals \nof trial economy and convenience, ” the Sixth Circuit has stated that “the primary purpose of this \nkind of joinder is to insure that a given transaction need only be proved once. ” United States v. \nFrost , 125 F.3d 346, 390 (6th Cir. 1997) (quoting United States v. Moreno , 933 F.2d 362, 369 (6t h \nCir. 1991)).  The Court notes that severing only Count 2 for separate trial appears to require \ncumulative proof of the March 2020 incident.  \nAccordingly, i n the interest of judicial economy , the Court ORDERS a hearing  on (1) \nwhether, as alleged in t he indictment , each count  “arises out of the same act or transaction or series \nof acts or transactions ,” Hatcher , 680 F.2d at 438; and (2) the most appropriate wa y to sever the \ncounts , in the event the Court determines Lewis was improperly joined . \nB.Unethical Citation Practices\nWright ’s Motion [DE 55] appears to contain  errone ous citations to fictitious opinions.1 \nNamely, Wright purports to cite the following “[f]ederal courts in Kentucky ” in support of his \nargument: (1) “United States v. Hang Le -Thy Tran , No. 3:07 -CR-53, 2008 WL 2699394 (E.D. Ky. \n1 [See also  DE 59 at 270 (Lewis noting that “Mr. Wright appears to  cite a non -existent [Abbott ] decision ,” \nthat “ the Westlaw citation provided did not  yield any results on Westlaw ” and  “[t]he case quotation \nprovided does not appear in any cases in the  Lexis database, an d the date of the cited decision —June 27, \n2023 —preda tes the Abbott  case”).] Case 3:25-cr-00030-RGJ     Document 73     Filed 11/10/25     Page 6 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 July 3, 2008) ”; (2) “United States v. Cope , 312 F. Supp. 2d 791 (E.D. Ky. 2004) ”; and (3) “United \nStates v. Abbott , 2023 WL 4106534 (E.D.) Ky. June 27, (2023). ” [DE 55 at 237]. Wright ’s brief \nalso contains  quotes from  the foregoing  cases  but does  not include  pin cites  referencing  where \nthese quotes were located —an unsurprising omission, given that no such cases exist. Even more \nconcerning,  the Motion  cites real  Sixth  Circuit  cases  but misrepresents  the holdings.  [Se e id. \n(discussing  “United  States  v. Chavis , 296 F.3d  450, 460 (6th Cir.  2002) ” and “United  States  v. \nTran, 433 F.3d 472, 478 (6th Cir. 2006)”)].    \nThe Court presumes that thes e errors were the result of using artificial intelligence (“AI”). \nAt \nthis point, it “is no secret that generative AI programs are known to ‘hallucinate ’ nonexistent \ncases, \nand with the advent of AI, courts have seen a rash of cases in which both counsel and pro \nse litigants have cited such fake, hallucinated cases in their briefs.” Sanders v. United States, \n176 Fed. Cl. 163, 169 (2025). “Without question, it is improper and unacceptable for \nlitigants . . . to submit ‘non-existent judicial opinions with fake quotes and citations. ’” \nAnonymous \nv. N.Y.C. Dep’t of Educ., No. 1:24-c v-04232, 2024 WL 3460049, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. \nJuly \n18, 2024) (citation modified). AI citations to real cases can be even more \nproblematic. See Seither & Cherry Quad Cities, Inc. v. Oakland Automation , LLC, No. 23-11310, \n2025 WL 2105286, at *1 (E.D. Mich. July 28, 2025) ( “When a case cite is ‘real,’ an attorney, or \nfor that matter a judge, might see a case they recognize and assume the quote or holding has been \naccurately  represented,  where  a case  that an  attorney  does  not recognize  might,  at least  at first \nblush,  trigger  more  exacting  scrutiny. ”) As this Court  has previously  recognized,  “many  harms \nflow\n from such deception —including wasting the opposing party ’s time and money, the Court ’s \ntime and resources, and reputational harms to the legal system (to name a few). ” Buckner v. Hilton \nGlob., No. 3:24- CV- 375-RGJ,  2025 WL  890175, at  *14 (W.D.  Ky. Mar.  21, 2025)  (quoting Case 3:25-cr-00030-RGJ     Document 73     Filed 11/10/25     Page 7 of 8 PageID #:\n<pageID>8Morgan v. Cmty.

See, e.g., Seither , 2025 WL 2105286, at *1\n(issuing similar show cause order).\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor all these reasons, and the Court being otherwise sufficiently advised, IT IS \nORDERED thatthis matter shall come for hearing to add ress Lewis ’Motion to Sever [DE 59] \nand for Wright ’s counsel to show cause on November 18, 2025 at 1:00 p.m.2\ncc: counsel of record\n2This case was previously set for hearing on the United States’ Garrity motion [DE 37], scheduled for \nNovember 18, 2025 at 1:30 p.m. [DE 72].

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In Weaver v. Shasta Services, LLC, Plaintiff John Weaver sued his employer for age discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation, primarily under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA). The Court partially granted Shasta's Motion to Dismiss, dismissing claims of hostile work environment and retaliation due to the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies with the EEOC, but allowed his age discrimination claim to proceed. AI was involved in this case as the plaintiff's legal brief contained \"hallucinations\" or incorrect case citations generated by an AI tool.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether John Weaver properly exhausted his administrative remedies necessary to bring claims of discrimination, hostile work environment, and retaliation under relevant statutes.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Weaver had adequately exhausted administrative remedies for the age discrimination claim, allowing it to proceed. However, it dismissed the hostile work environment and retaliation claims due to insufficient details in the EEOC charge that would have alerted the defendant or initiated further investigation into those issues.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: John Weaver, a manager who believed he was unfairly fired because he's old, sued his work. The court said he correctly complained about age discrimination, so that part of his case can continue, but he couldn't sue for a bad work environment or getting back at him for filing complaints because he didn’t tell the government about those issues first. And oh, while preparing his legal papers, his law tools came up with some fake legal cases – oops!",

(ECF \nNo. 1). On August 18, 2025, Defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss and accompanying brief. (ECF Nos. 10 & 11). On September 8, 2025, Plaintiff filed his Brief in Opposition . (ECF No s. 12 & \n13).\n1 On September 15, 2025, Defendant filed its Reply. (ECF No. 14). For the following \nreason s, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part. \nI. Statement of Facts\n1 Plaintiff refiled his Brief in Opposition, at ECF No. 13, with an appended exhibit indicating that two case citations \nwithin the original filing “do not adequately address the issues cited in my brief.” It is clear to the Court that the case \ncitations at issue, within the original Brief in Opposition, were “hallucinations” created by Artificial Intelligence.  Case 2:25-cv-00910-MJH     Document 15     Filed 10/22/25     Page 1 of 82 \n Plaintiff, John Weaver began working as Plant Manager at  Shasta Services, LLC (“Shasta”) \non or around January 1, 2024. (ECF No. 1, at ¶ 9). Plaintiff alleges that during his time working \nat Shasta, various employees made comments about his age. Allison Cunningham, Human Resource Manager, questioned whether Plai ntiff’s age on his onboarding documents were \ncorrect, because “the date listed would put him over the age of seventy.” ( Id. ¶ 10). Plaintiff \nalleges that Mark Snyder, Operations Manager at Shasta, told Plaintiff that he should retire , \nbecause Plaintiff was one of the oldest employees at Shasta “if [Shasta] want to get rid of [Plaintiff] they’ll find a reason.” ( Id. ¶ 11). On June 1, 2024, Shasta’s Maintenance Manager \nsuggested that they have a “mock audit” on July 17, 2024, to prepare for an a ctual Maintenance \naudit that was forthcoming. ( Id. ¶ 13). Plaintiff alleges that, on July 17, 2024, the actual \nMaintenance audit was performed . (Id. ¶ 15). At the audit, safety violations related to Lock \nOut/Tag Out (LO/TO) procedures were not being perfor med by Grinder Operators on grinding \nmachines. ( Id.). On that same day, Shaun Mienke, Senior Vice President of TMS International\n2, \nterminated Plaintiff, attributing the termination to Plaintiff’s failure to implement the LO/TO procedures. ( Id. ¶ 20). Plai ntiff alleges that his termination was actually because of his age. ( Id. ¶ \n21). In support of this contention, Plaintiff alleges that  employees younger than plaintiff also did \nnot comply with the  LO/TO procedures  in 2023, but were  not terminated or discipl ined. ( Id. ¶ \n22). Further, Plaintiff  alleges that, just a day after he was terminated, Shasta decided the LO/TO \nservices were not needed on the grinding machines. ( Id. ¶ 21) . \nOn January 10, 2025, Plaintiff filed a Charge of Discrimination with the EEOC aga inst \nShasta. (ECF No. 10- 1). The Charge alleged as follows:  \n \n2 The Compla int does not make clear TMS International’s relationship to Shasta, but from the facts alleged within \nthe Complaint it seems that TMS International is Shasta’s parent company.  Case 2:25-cv-00910-MJH     Document 15     Filed 10/22/25     Page 2 of 83 \n I began working as a Plant Manager for the Respondent at its Aliquippa, PA \nlocation in January of 2024. During my employment I did not receive any \ndisciplinary actions or performance reviews. On or about July 17, 2024[,] I was \ndischarged from employment.  \nThe Respondent stated I was discharged due to lock out/tag out procedures not \nbeing followed.  \n I believe the Respondent discharged me because of my age, 71, in violation of \nthe Age Discrimination  in Employment Act (ADEA). At least two (2) other \nindividuals much younger than me knew of and were responsible for the issues which resulted in my discharge prior to my being hired and during my employment but, they were not disciplined or discharged. The ir names are Mark Whalen and \nShawn Mienke.  \n(Id.).  \n \nII. Relevant Legal Standard  \nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), \nthe court must “accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most \nfavorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonabl e reading of the complaint, \nthe plaintiff may be entitled to relief.”  Eid v. Thompson, 740 F.3d 118, 122 (3d Cir. 2014) (quoting Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny , 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008)). “To survive a motion to \ndismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting B ell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). \nThe Supreme Court clarified that this plausibility standard should not be conflated with a \nhigher probability standard.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. “A claim has facial plausibility when the \nplaintiff plead s factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 556); see also Thompson v. Real Estate Mortg. Network , 748 F.3d 142, 147 (3d Cir. \n2014). “Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory Case 2:25-cv-00910-MJH     Document 15     Filed 10/22/25     Page 3 of 84 \n statements, do not suffice.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. “Factual allegations of a complaint must be \nenough to raise a right to relief above the speculati ve level.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555. A \npleading party need not establish the elements of a prima facie  case at this stage; the party must \nonly “put forth allegations that ‘raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal \nevidence of the necessary  element[s].’”  Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside , 578 F.3d 203, 213 (3d Cir. \n2009) (quoting Graff v. Subbiah Cardiology Assocs., Ltd., 2008 WL 2312671 (W.D. Pa. 2008)); see also Connelly v. Lane Constr. Corp., 809 F.3d 780, 790 (3d Cir. 2016). \nNonetheless, a court  need not credit bald assertions, unwarranted inferences, or legal \nconclusions cast in the form of factual averments.  Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 n.8 (3d Cir. 1997). The primary question in deciding a motion to dismiss is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail; but rather, whether he or she is entitled to offer evidence to establish the facts alleged in the complaint.  Maio v. Aetna, 221 F.3d 472, 482 (3d Cir. 2000).The purpose of a motion to dismiss is to “streamline[] litigation by dispensing with needless \ndiscovery and factfinding.”  Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 326- 27 (1989). \nIII. Discussion  \nThe Title VII and ADEA claims brought by Plaintiff all require an exhaust ion of  any \nrequired  administrative remedies before bri nging a claim for judicial relief. See Mandel v. M & \nQ Packaging Corp., 706 F.3d 157, 163 (3d Cir. 2013)  (Title VII); see also Seredinski v. Clifton \nPrecision Prods. Co., Div., of Litton Sys., 776 F.2d 56, 63 (3d Cir. 1985) (ADEA). To properly exhaust the required administrative remedies, a plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination with the EEOC and receive a right to sue letter. Mandel , 706 F. 3d at 163. Such filing serves to \n“define the scope of the [EEOC]’s investigation and to notify the defendant of the charges against it.” Barzanty v. Verizon PA, Inc., 361 F.App’x 411, 415 (3d Cir. 2010). The charge of Case 2:25-cv-00910-MJH     Document 15     Filed 10/22/25     Page 4 of 85 \n discrimination allows  “the EEOC the opportunity to settle disputes through conference, \nconciliation, and persuasion, avoiding unnecessary action in court.” Antol v. Perry, 82 F.3d 1291, \n1296 (3d Cir. 1996). “The parameters of the civil action in the district court are defined by the scope of the EEOC investigation which can be reasonably expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.” Atkinson v. LaFayette Coll., 460 F.3d 447, 453 (3d Cir. 2006); see also Simko v. U.S. Steel Corp., 992 F.3d 198, 207 (3d Cir. 2021) (“The relevant test for determining whether a later claim needs to be exhausted despite the filing of a previous charge is a two -pronged inquiry \ninto whether the acts alleged in the subsequent suit are fairly within the scope of [1] the prior EEOC complaint, or [2] the investigation arising therefrom.”) (internal quotations omitted). \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff’s hostile work environment, retaliation, and ADEA \ndiscrimination claims must be  dismissed, because Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative \nremedies as to these claims.  (ECF No. 11). Specifically, Defendant argues that  Plaintiff’s claims \nwithin his complaint do not fit within the scope of his prior EEOC Charge. ( Id.). Plaintiff  argues \nthat all his claims are fairly within the scope of his EEOC Charge or any investigation that would have followed from the Charge. (ECF No. 12).  \nA. Age Discrimination Claims  \nPlaintiff brings a ge discrimination c laims against Defendant under the ADEA an d PHRA. \n(ECF No. 1, at ¶ ¶¶ 28- 53). Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not exhausted his administrative \nremedies as to these claims. ( ECF No. 11, at 9- 10). Plaintiff argues that his age discrimination \nclaims are properly within the scope of his EEOC Charge. (ECF No. 12, at 6- 12). \nTo establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, a plaintiff must prove: (1) he is a \nmember of the protected class, i.e., he is at least 40 years old; (2) he is qualified for the position Case 2:25-cv-00910-MJH     Document 15     Filed 10/22/25     Page 5 of 86 \n in question; (3) he suffered an adve rse employment action; and (4) the circumstances \nsurrounding the adverse action “could give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.” \nBurton v. Teleflex Inc. , 707 F.3d 417, 426 (3d Cir. 2013) . \nIn his EEOC Charge, Plaintiff stated:  \nI believe the Respondent discharged me because of my age, 71, in violation of \nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). At least two (2) other \nindividuals much younger than me knew of and were responsible for the issues which resulted in my discharge prior to my being hired and during my employment but, they were not disciplined or discharged. Their names are Mark Whalen and Shawn Mienke.  \n(ECF No. 10- 1). Although Plaintiff’s EEOC Charge is not specific, it is clear from the \ncontents of the EEOC Charg e that Plaintiff intended to bring a discrimination claim against \nDefendant under the ADEA. The administrative remedy exhaustion requirement does not \nmandate that a Plaintiff include every detail of the alleged wrongs against them to satisfy the requiremen t, just enough that the Defendant is notified of the charges against it.  \nPlaintiff’s Charge clearly puts the Defendant on notice of an ADEA discrimination claim. As such, Plaintiff has properly exhausted his administrative remedies as to his age discrimina tion claims against Defendant. Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s age \ndiscrimination claims under the ADEA and PHRA, at Count I of the Complaint, will be denied.  \nB. Hostile Work Environment Claims  \nPlaintiff brings a hostile work environment claim agai nst Defendant under the ADEA, Title \nVII, and the PHRA. (ECF No. 1, at ¶¶ 66- 67). Defendant argues that Plaintiff’s hostile work \nenvironment claim is not within the scope of Plaintiff’s EEOC Charge.  (ECF No. 11, at 6- 8). Case 2:25-cv-00910-MJH     Document 15     Filed 10/22/25     Page 6 of 87 \n Plaintiff’s EEOC Charge contains  no allegations related to a hostile work environment claim \nsuch that Defendant would have be en put on notice of such violations , nor that the EEOC w ould \nhave investi gated further into any hostile work environment claims. As such, Plaintiff has fai led \nto exhaust his administrative remedies as to his hostile work environment claims. Defendant’s \nMotion to Dismiss Plaintiff’s hostile work environment claims, at Count III of the Complaint, will be granted.  \nC. Retaliation Claims  \nPlaintiff brings a claim for  retaliation against Defendant under an unspecified statute. (ECF \nNo. 1, at ¶¶ 68- 75). Defendant argues that the scope of Plaintiff’s EEOC Charge does not \nencompass any retaliation claim. ( ECF No. 11, at 8-9). Defendant further argues that Plaintiff’s \ncomp laint does not plead facts sufficient to allege a retaliation claim. ( Id.). Plaintiff argues  that \nhis retaliation claim is within the scope of this EEOC Charge. (ECF No. 12). \n Plaintiff’s EEOC Charge does not contain any allegations of retaliation or any f acts that \nwould cause a reasonable reader of the EEOC Charge to be put on notice of such a claim or be compelled to investigate any sort of retaliatory actions. As such, Plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his retaliation claims . Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss  Plaintiff’s \nretaliation claims , at Count IV of the Complaint, will be granted.  \nD. Count II: Wrongful Termination  \nPlaintiff brings a claim for wrongful termination against Defendant. Defendant argues that \nPlaintiff’s wrongful ter mination claim is preempted by the ADEA, Title VII, and the PHRA. \n(ECF No. 11, at 11). Plaintiff argues that his wrongful termination claim is in the alternative to his statutory discrimination claims. (ECF No. 12, at 7).

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Thomas Goddard, residing in a property managed by SARES-REGIS GROUP, Inc., sued for various claims including disability and religious discrimination after repeatedly failing to pay rent. The court dismissed Goddard's lawsuit with prejudice due to his failure to oppose the motion to dismiss, after having been warned and given several extensions to respond. It was also noted that Goddard's amended complaints contained irrelevant and unsupported claims, potentially generated via AI, and failed to demonstrate any legal merit.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue was whether the defendants unlawfully discriminated against Goddard by not accommodating his disabilities and financial circumstances as per the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, among other claims.\n\n3. **Court’s Holding:** The court dismissed the case with prejudice due to Goddard's failure to respond to the defendants' motion to dismiss and because the claims lacked legal merit. The decision was based on Goddard's inability to show any viable cause of action against the defendants, coupled with irrelevant and excessive filings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Thomas Goddard took his landlords to court, claiming they didn't treat him fairly because of his disabilities and asked for unreasonable rent reductions. However, he didn't pay his rent and didn't respond to important court requests on time. The court found his demands and claims to be unfounded and legally useless, so they decided he couldn't try again with a new case. The judge even hinted that Goddard might have used a computer program to create some of his confusing and lengthy documents without adding any real support to his case.",

Dkt. \nNo. 38.  For the reasons discussed below, Defendant s’ Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED WITH \nPREJUDICE .  \n \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff currently resides at 1910 N. Main St, Unit 627, Walnut  Creek, CA 94596  in an \napartment owned by Defendant APARTMENTS CAPITAL LLC, A D  and managed by Defendant \nSARES REGIS GROUP RESIDENTIAL, INC.   In early March  of 2025, Plaintiff requested extra \ntime for his rental payment grace period as a disability accommodation.  Dkt. No. 24 -1 at 7.  On \nMarch 13, Defendants granted this accommodation, allowing Plaintiff to pay rent by the seventh \nof the month without being charged a late fee or pay -or-quit notice.   Id.  Defendants noted that if \nrent was not pa id by the seventh of the month, the late fee would be applied and a 3-day notice \nserved.  Id.  Shortly after being granted this accommodation, Plaintiff failed to pay rent within the \nextended grace period.  Dkt. No. 24 at 3.  After Plaintiff continued to fail to pay rent, Defendant \nserved him with a pay -or-quit notice on July 10.  Id.  The same day, Plaintiff requested a new \naccommodation: that Defendant reduce his monthly rent from $2,850 to $400.  Id. at 4.  Defendant Case 3:25-cv-05882-EMC     Document 57     Filed 10/21/25     Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  refused this request and this lawsuit followed.  \n \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \nOn July 14, Plaintiff filed the instant suit, seeking an ex parte temporary restraining order \nagainst his eviction.  Dkt. Nos. 1 -2.  After a hearing, the Court granted the TRO in limited part, \nrestraining Defendants from initiating an unlawful detainer action against Plaintiff for 28 days, and \nset a preliminary injunction hearing.  Dkt. No. 21.  After hearing the parties’ oral argum ent, the \nCourt denied Plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction because Plaintiff had not shown \nlikelihood of irreparable h arm, Plaintiff had not shown the balance of hardships tipped sharply in \nhis favor, and Plaintiff had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits.  Dkt. No. 29.   \nPlaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court denied.  Dkt.  No. 33.  On September \n3, 2025, Plaintiff filed a FAC  stating the following causes of action: 1) Fair Housing Act – \ndisability discrimination; 2) Fair Housing Act – religious discrimination;  3) Fair Housing Act – \nRetaliation; 4) Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA), T itle II ; 5)  Rehabilitation Act – Section \n504; 6) Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights; 7) Negligent  Infliction of Emotional Distress; 8) \nIntentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; 9) Fair Housing  Act – Breach of Agreed Reasonable \nAccommodation; 10) Discrimination.   Dkt. No. 3 6.  \nOn September 18, Defendants filed the instant Motion to Dismiss.  Plaintiff’s deadline to \nfile a response to the Motion to Dismiss was October 2, 2025.  Dkt. No. 38 .  Plaintiff failed to file \na response to the Motion to Dismiss by October 2, and did not seek any extension of time or \notherwise provide an explanation for this failure to respond, although on October 6 Plaintiff \nrequested leave to file a Second Amended Co mplaint.  Dkt. No. 45.  On October 8, Defendants \nfiled a Notice of Plaintiff’s Non -Oppositi on to the Motion to Dismiss.  Dkt. No. 4 7.   \nOn October 10, the Court denied Plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend.  Dkt. No. 49.  Due \nto Plaintiff’s pro se status, the Court granted Plaintiff a sua sponte extension to respond to the \nMotion to Dismiss until October 16, two weeks after the response wa s originally due.  Id.  The \nCourt warned Plaintiff that if Plaintiff failed to file a response to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, \nthe Court would grant the motion as unopposed.  Id.  Plaintiff did not file a response by October Case 3:25-cv-05882-EMC     Document 57     Filed 10/21/25     Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  16, and as of the entry of this Order, has still not filed a response.  \nPlaintiff has made other filings , however .  In violation of  the Court’s October 10 Order \nthat, due to Plaintiff’s unprompted and voluminous filings, Plaintiff must seek leave of Court \nbefore making further filings (other than the late motion to dismiss response) Plaintiff has \ncontinued in this conduct, making f ive additional filings with a combined page -count of over 700 \npages  over the span of ten days .  Dkt. Nos. 50, 51 , 53, 54 , 56.  On October 14, Plaintiff also failed \nto appear at the scheduled 1:30 pm Case Management Conference  hearing .  Instead of appearing, \nPlaintiff filed a same -day motion for an “emergency hearing” for 3:30 pm that afternoon, in \nviolation of Local Rule  7-2(a).  Dkt. No. 53.  \nOn October 20, Defendant filed a notice noting Plaintiff’s continued failure to oppose its \nmotion, despite the Court’s October 16 deadline.  Dkt. No. 56.  Less than an hour later, Plaintiff \nfiled a 192 -page “Emergency Response to Defendants’ Notice of Non -Opposition,” in which he \nargued that his Motion for Leave to File Second Amended Complaint and proposed Second \nAmended Complaint constituted his opposition.  Dkt. No. 56.  \n \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nA motion may be granted when a party fails to oppose it.  Local Rule 7 -3(a-b); Rider v. \nJPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. , No. 20 -CV-06888 -LHK, 2021 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12486, at *4 (N.D. \nCal. Jan. 22, 2021) (“[A]  district court may properly grant a motion for failure to file an \nopposition. ”; accord, e.g. , Gwaduri v. INS , 362 F.3d 1144, 1146 -47, n.3 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding \nthat it “is beyond question ” that courts may grant unopposed motions) .  Plaintiff has not filed an \nopposition despite multiple warnings from Defendants and this Court.  To the extent that Plaintiff \nrelies on Rule 15, Rule 15 makes clear that a party may amend its pleadings “once as a matter of \ncourse” and in “all other cases” may amend only with leave of court or consent of the opposing \nparty.  Fed. R. Civ. Pr. 15(1) -(2).  Here, the Court denied Plainti ff leave to file a Second Amended \nComplaint.  Dkt. No. 49.  The Court grants the unopposed motion to dismiss.  \nBeyond Plaintiffs’ failure to oppose , the merits also support dismissal.  Plaintiffs’ 100 -\npage First Amended Complaint states ten causes of action under various federal civil rights laws, Case 3:25-cv-05882-EMC     Document 57     Filed 10/21/25     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  including the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disability Act, alleging disability -based  \nand religious discrimination.  The FAC, like Plaintiff ’s other filings, devotes countless  pages to \nextraneous issues, including actions taken by non -parties  such as his former employer  and \n“statistical analysis.”   See e.g . Dkt. No. 36 at 3 (“A dditional evidence of systematic discrimination \nincludes the unprecedented mass  recusal of all thirty -nine Contra Costa Superior Court judges on \nJuly 24, 2025 (Ex.

The complaint \ndoes not comply with Rule 8’s requirement that a claim must be “short and plain.”  Fed. R. Civ. \nPro. 8(a)(2).  This alone is another ground for dismissal.  See e.g, McHenry v. Renne , 84 F.3d \n1172, 1174 (9th Cir. 1996) . \nThe core of Plaintiff’s complaint, as the Court understands it , is that Defendants  refused to \naccommodate Plaintiffs’ disability and medical issues.  Although Defendants granted Plaintiffs’ \nrequest for a grace period to pay rent until the seventh day of the month, Plaintiff claims in the \nFAC that Defendants violated this accommodation by serving a pay -or-quit notice.  The complaint \ndoes not address the undisputed fact that shortly after receiving this accommodation, Plaintiff \nfailed to pay rent and has not paid rent since.  See Dkt. No. 29 ( as of this  August, Plaintiff ’s \narrearage was over $7,000) .  The FAC also omits the fact, conceded by Plaintiff at his hearing for \npreliminary injunction, that the accommodation Defendants have failed to grant him is a rent Case 3:25-cv-05882-EMC     Document 57     Filed 10/21/25     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  decrease from $ 2,850 to $400  until Plaintiff  receives money from his other pending lawsuits and \ndisability claims .  See id.   As the Court explained in its Order denying a preliminary injunction, a \ndenial of “meaningful access” to a program due to  a person’s inability to “satisfy a condition of \neligibility because of his financial circumstances” is  not a violation of the ADA.  See Weinreich v. \nLos Angeles Cnty. Metro. Transp. Auth. , 114 F.3d  976, 979 (9th Cir. 1997) ; Dkt. No. 29 .  Plaintiff \nalso argues that Defendants’ filing of a pay-or-quit notice was retaliation, but this notice followed \nPlaintiffs’ failure to pay rent for two months, a clear non-retaliatory basis.  Dkt. No. 29.  Finally, \nall of Plaintiffs’ claims of religious discrimination relate to actions by individuals that are \nunaffiliated with Defendants, including Plaintiff’s  former employer Slickdeals, other employees at \nSlickdeals, and his former girlfriend.  While Plaintiff claims his former girlfriend is affiliated with \nDefendants, the exhibits he points to do not support this .  See e.g., Dkt. No. 36 at 12 (citing \nExhibit Q at Dkt. No. 10 -1 at 212) ; see also  Dkt. No. 38 at 8. \nDefendants seek dismissal with prejudice.  A court may deny leave to amend after \nconsidering factors such as “bad faith, undue delay, prejudice to the opposing party, futility of the \namendment, and whether the party has previously amended his pleadings.”   Bonin v. Calderon , 59 \nF.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir.1995).   Here, the factors support dismissal with prejudice.  Plaintiff has \nalready amended his complaint in September with the benefit of the Court’s ruling denying his \npreliminary injunction.  Rather than providing new facts, the FAC  provided additional irrelevant \nincidents, argument, and statistics, and omitted  relevant facts that Plaintiff had already admitted to \nbefore the Court .  \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint further confirms that \namendment would be futile.  Plaintiff sought amendment to address “new developments” \nincluding (1) that Defendants served another pay -or-quit notice (2) that Defendants e xpressed \nwillingness to participate in settlement discussions (3) that the California Civil Rights Department \nresumed mediation proceedings in Plaintiffs’ separate case there (4) that Defendants filed a joint \ncase management statements providing their posi tions on discovery, trial, and settlement.  Dkt. \nNo. 49.  As the Court explained in its order denying leave to amend, the state of settlements \ndiscussions, the status of mediation in other proceedings, and Defendants’ “ positions on discovery, Case 3:25-cv-05882-EMC     Document 57     Filed 10/21/25     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  trial, and settlement”  are not relevant to Plaintiff’s pleadings.  Id.  The Court found that \nDefendants’ service of an additional pay -or-quit notice would not alter Plaintiffs’ pleadings, since \nDefendants’ basis for serving the pay -or-quit remains Plaintiff’s failure to pay rent.  Id.  The SAC \nthat Plaintiff sought to file was over 150 -pages, heightening rather than curing Plaintiff’s Rule 8 \nproblem.  Plaintiff’s prior amendment and his proposed second amendment demonstrate that leave \nto amend is futile in this case.   Plaintiff’s case is legally meritless.  \nThe factors of bad faith and prejudice to the opposing party also strongly support dismissal \nwith prejudice.  As noted, Plaintiff’s filings in this action have been excessive, almost wholly \nirrelevant to the claims alleged, and have made factual statements unsupported or contradicted by \nthe attached exhibits.  Defendant s have already reviewed over a thousand pages of confused and \nlegally irrelevant filings for claims that the Court had found to lack merit even after amendment.  \nThere is no cause to require Defendant s to undergo further time and litigation expense, particularly \nas amendment would be futile.  \nFinally, the Court notes that Plaintiffs’ filing have contained repeated misrepresentations \nof Plaintiff’s prior statements  and actions , Defendants’ actions, and the Court’s own actions.  This \nmay stem from the fact that Plaintiffs’ filings have likely been generated in whole or in part \nthrough Generative Artificial Intelligence.  Given Plaintiff’s pro se and in forma pauperis status , \nthe Court will not issue a show cause order under Rule 11 at this time.  \nAccordingly, for all the reasons stated above, Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss is \nGRANTED  WITH PREJUDICE .  The Clerk of Court is directed to enter a final judgment.  \n \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \n \nDated:  October 2 1, 2025  \n \n______________________________________  \nEDWARD M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves Erika Nicole Cofer, a pro se plaintiff, who is contesting a custody dispute and alleging cybercrimes related to artificial intelligence (AI) against her and its incorporation into an elaborate scheme by the defendants, including her mother, government officials, and corporations. The court reviews her complaint for sufficiency under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B), particularly failing to establish federal jurisdiction, as she did not show that the defendants acted under color of state law as required for a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether federal jurisdiction exists under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for Plaintiff's claims of constitutional violations when she alleges cybercrimes involving AI by parties she describes as government officials but subsequently refers to them as employees of a private company.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court finds that Erika Nicole Cofer has not established a basis for federal jurisdiction, as she did not adequately demonstrate that the defendants acted under color of state law or that any state actor requirement is fulfilled. The court orders her to show cause why the case should not be dismissed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine your neighbor accuses their family and some big tech companies of using \"computer magic\" to spy on them during a child custody fight. They went to court without a lawyer to say this violates their privacy, but they didn't clearly show that these people were acting like \"officials\" when they did it. The court told them they could fix their paperwork—like clarifying who did what and why it matters—otherwise, the court can't really handle their case.",

INTRODUCTION  \nPlaintiff Erica Cofer , pro se, applied to proceed in forma pauperis  and the Court granted \nher application .  See Docket No. 7.  The Court now reviews the sufficiency of Plaintiff’s  \ncomplaint to determine whether it satisfies 28 U.S.C. §  1915(e)(2)(B).  Because the complaint \ndoes not appear to allege federal jurisdiction, Plaintiff is ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE why the \ncomplaint should not be dismissed.   Plaintiff  may f ile either an amended complaint  or a response \nto this order addressing  why her complaint is sufficient, no later than December 10,  2025 .  The \nCase Management Conference set for December 3, 2025  is vacated.  \nII. ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT1 \nThis case appears to be related to a custody dispute concerning Plaintiff’s son that was or \nis pending in state court. Plaintiff has named as defendants Brenda Gayle Martin (Plaintiff’s \nmother ), Edward Vergel Astorga, Sr. (the father of the child ), Adrian Leandre McDani els (Brenda \nMartin’s “step -nephew”) and his wife Sarah Elizabeth Lange McDaniels , SecurityBricks, Inc., \n \n1 Because the factual allegations of a plaintiff’s complaint are generally taken as true in the context \nof determining whether the complaint states a claim, this section summarizes Plaintiff’s  \nallegations as if true.  Nothing in this order should be construed as resolving any issue of fact that \nmight be disputed at a later stage of the case  Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “Corp -Partner Google[,]” and Micr osoft.  Compl. at 1 -4. According to Plaintiff, the child custody \ndispute is “fabricated” and has “turned into a[n] inside cyberbullying scheme job , with artificial \nintelligence and aviation, which [makes] this case difficult to understand and it’s beyond the scope  \nof one’s intellect. ”  Id.  at 5-6.  Plaintiff  asserts federal jurisdiction based on alleged violation of \nher Fourth Amendment rights .  Id.  at 2. \nPlaintiff’s allegations related to the defendants’ “coercion, perjury and intentional false \nstatements” in the custody case are lengthy and detailed , as are the allegations related to \ndefendants’ alleged “cybersecurity attacks”  on her computer and cell phone.  The Court does not \nattempt to summarize these allegations but instead describes only the allegations that are relevant \nto the existence of federal jurisdiction.   \nPlaintiff alleges that her mother and Edward Vergel Astorga, Sr. “teamed up” to deprive \nher of custody of her son.  Id.  at 6.  Plaintiff alleges that when she told her mother that she was \ngoing to inform the judge in the state court case about her mother’s perjury in that case, her \nmother “orchestrated the McDaniels to destroy all of the digital evidence [and] put tainted \nevidence in [her] computer and [her] cel l phone systems, that appears to makes [her] appear to be \na pedophile.”  Id. Plaintiff further alleges that the “McDaniels deprived [her] of using [her] emails, \nblocked [her] from paying [her] bills” and she “now [ha s] bad credit.”  Id. Plaintiff alleges that she \nis ”constantly under surveillance with hacking and tracking”  and that she is being tracked “by \nairplane.”   Id.  at 7. \nPlaintiff alleges  that “[s]ince [she is]  being tracked by aviation this has given reason to \nbelieve the McDaniels couple who are government officials has fabricated and fraudulently given \nthe federal police officials a tainted false report against [her]  to intentionally get [her]  arrested, this \nalso gives [her] reason they are all jointly working together to build a fraudulent case against \n[her].” Id.  at 7-8.  Plaintiff later alleges that the McDaniels are employed by Defendant \nSecurityBrick, Inc. , where S arah McDaniels is a “Cybersecurity Strategic Advisor” and Adrian \nMcDaniels is a “Project Management GRC Analyst.”  Id.  at 20.   Plaintiff alleges that the \nMcDaniels attended a re straining order hearing  to listen to Plaintiff’s testimony and “destroy \nevidence pertaining to the fraud and fabrication of [her] child custody case[,]” and  destroyed Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 2 of 6 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  evidence in Plaintiff’s computer so that Brenda Martin could avoid prosecution .  Id.  at 19 -20.  \nAccording to Plaintiff, Brenda Martin also stated at the restraining order hearing that the \nMcDaniels were “helping her with phone call logs and other things related to evidence.”  Id. at 20. \nPlaintiff alleges that the McDaniels committed a cybercrime against her.  Id.  \nPlaintiff asserts three claims  in her complaint.  First, she asserts a claim under the Fourth \nand Fourteenth Amendments against Defendants Brenda Martin, Sara McDaniels and Adrian \nMcDaniels.  Id.at 21.  In this claim, Plaintiff alleges that Martin conspired with Sara and Adrian \nMcDaniels, “who are officials acting in a government capacity,” to deprive her of her right to \nprivacy under the Fourth Amendment by hacking into her electronic devices.  Id.  As part of this \nclaim, Plaintiff alleges that the McDanie ls defendants “abused their power while they [were] \nemployed as Cybersecurity Strategic Advisors and Project Management.”  Id.  at 22.  She also \nalleges in this claim that the McDaniels defendants acted “under color of law.”  Id. \nSecond, Plaintiff  asserts a claim for violation of her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments \nagainst Microsoft Corporation and Google Corporation.  Id.  at 23.  According to Plaintiff, \nMicrosoft and Google “assisted the McDaniels” defendants with respect to their alleged \ncybercrimes against her.  Id. \nThird, Plaintiff asserts a claim for perjury and defamation against defendants Brenda \nMartin and Eward Astorga.  Id.  at 24.  \nIn her demand for relief, Plaintiff asks the Court for “civil liability under Sec. 1983 ” and \nboth monetary and injunctive relief.  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nA. Legal Standards Under 28 U.S.C. § 1915 and Rule 12(b)(6)  \nWhere a plaintiff is found to be indigent under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(1) and is granted leave \nto proceed in forma pauperis, courts must engage in screening and dismiss any claims which: \n(1) are frivolous or malicious; (2) fail to state a claim on which relie f may be granted; or (3) seek \nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.  28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B); see \nMarks v. Solcum , 98 F.3d 494, 495 (9th Cir. 1996).   In addition, the Court must dismiss a \ncomplaint where no basis for federal j urisdiction is apparent from the allegations.  Cato v. United Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  States, 70 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir. 1995).    \nTo state a claim for relief, a plaintiff must make “a short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).   Further, a claim may be \ndismissed for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6);  \nsee also Diaz v. Int’l Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local  13, 474 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir. \n2007).  In determining whether a plaintiff fails to state a claim, the court takes “all allegations of \nmaterial fact in t he complaint as true and construe[s] them in the light most favorable to the non -\nmoving party.”  Cedars -Sinai Med. Ctr. v. Nat’l League of Postmasters of U.S ., 497 F.3d 972, 975 \n(9th Cir. 2007).  However, “the tenet that a court must accept a complaint’s allegations as true is \ninapplicable to legal conclusions [and] mere conclusory statements,” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. \n662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)), and courts “do not \nnecessarily assume the truth of legal c onclusions merely because they are cast in the form of \nfactual allegations.” Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg , 593 F.3d 1031, 1034 (9th Cir. 2010) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  The complaint need not contain “detailed factual allegations,” but must \nallege facts sufficient to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Id. at 678 (citing \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 570).  \nWhere the complaint has been filed by a pro se plaintiff, courts must “construe the \npleadings liberally . . . to afford the petitioner the benefit of any doubt.”  Hebbe v. Pliler , 627 F.3d \n338, 342 (9th Cir. 2010).  “A pro se litigant must be given leave to amend his or her complaint \nunless it is absolutely clear that the deficiencies in the complaint could not be cured by \namendment.”  Noll v. Carlson , 809 F.2d 1446, 1448 (9th Cir. 1987), superseded on other grounds \nby statute, as recognized in Lopez v. Smi th, 203 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc).  Further, \nwhen it dismisses the complaint of a pro se litigant with leave to amend, “the district court must \nprovide the litigant with notice of the deficiencies in his complaint in order to ensure that the \nlitiga nt uses the opportunity to amend effectively.”  Id. (quoting Ferdik v. Bonzelet , 963 F.2d \n1258, 1261 (9th Cir. 1992)).  “Without the benefit of a statement of deficiencies, the pro se litigant \nwill likely repeat previous errors.”  Karim -Panahi v. L.A. Po lice Dep’t , 839 F.2d 621, 624 (9th \nCir. 1988) (quoting Noll v. Carlson , 809 F.2d 1446, 1448 (9th Cir. 1987)).  Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  B. Discussion  \nAs a preliminary matter, the Court must address whether there is federal jurisdiction over  \nPlaintiff's complaint. See B.C. v. Plumas Unified Sch. Dist ., 192 F.3d 1260, 1264 (9th Cir. 1999).  \nFederal courts have limited subject matter jurisdiction and may only hear cases falling within their  \njurisdiction. The two most common forms of federal subject matter jurisdiction are federal  \nquestion jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332.  \nHere, Plaintiff invokes federal question jurisdiction based on violation of her rights under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983 and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment s of the U.S. Constitution.  She has not, \nhowever, state a claim under Section 1983  and therefore, she has not established the existence of \nfederal jurisdiction in this case.  \n Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 , a claim for violation of constitutional rights may be brought  \nagainst a “person who, under color of any [state law], subjects, or causes to be subjected, any \n[person] to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and \nlaws.” 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Plaintiff attempts to meet the state actor requirement by alleging that the \nMcDaniels defendants are “government official” who acted under “color of law” and that the y \nworked together with the other named defendants to deprive  her of her constitutional rights.  \nHowever, she has not identified any specific government position held by the McDaniels \ndefendants and contradicts her allegations that they are government officials by alleging that they \nwork for a private company, SecurityBrick, Inc., as a “Cybersecurity Strategic Advisor” (Sara \nMcDaniels) and a “Project Management GRC Analyst”  (Adrian McDaniels ).    \n Because Plaintiff does not allege facts showing that the state actor requirement  under 42 \nU.S.C. § 1983  is met, she fails to state a federal claim in her complaint.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the reasons discussed above, Plaintiff is ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE why this case \nshould not be dismissed because there is no federal jurisdiction over her complaint.    Plaintiff may \nrespond by filing either an amended complaint that addresses the deficiencies discussed above or a \nresponse that addresses why her current complaint is sufficient.  Plaintiff’s response shall be filed \nby December 10, 2025 .   If Plaintiff does not file a response by that date, the case will be Case 3:25-cv-07239-JCS     Document 9     Filed 11/11/25     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  reassigned to a United States district judge with a recommendation that it be  dismissed pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).  \nAny amended complaint must include the caption and civil case number used in this order \n(25-cv-7239)  and the words FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT on the first page.  Because an \namended complaint completely replaces the previous complaint, any amended complaint may not \nincorporate claims or allegations of Plaintiff ’s original complaint by reference, but instead must \ninclude all of the facts and claims Plaintiff  wishes to present and all of the defendants he wishes to \nsue.   \nPlaintiff , who is not represented by counsel, is encouraged to consult with the Federal Pro \nBono Project’s Legal Help Center in either of the Oakland or San Francisco federal courthouses \nfor assistance.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The case involves Aaron Ogletree, a student at Cleveland State University, who challenged the university's practice of conducting virtual room scans before remote exams, filing a suit alleging that these scans violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The court held that such room scans constituted searches under the Fourth Amendment, and that they were unreasonable, thus siding with Ogletree and granting him declaratory and injunctive relief. The case touches on the use of AI/automation in the sense that Cleveland State utilized AI proctoring tools, but the room scan itself was not AI-driven.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue is whether the virtual room scans conducted by Cleveland State University as part of its remote exam proctoring process constitute unreasonable searches in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the room scans conducted by Cleveland State University are searches under the Fourth Amendment and are unreasonable, thus violating the Fourth Amendment. The court granted declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction favoring Aaron Ogletree, preventing the university from conducting such room scans without consent or a reasonable alternative.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine if your school wanted to check your room over a video call before an online test to see if you're cheating, but you don't want them to do that because it's private. The court decided that your room is a private space, and the school can't look in just because they want to. They need another way to make sure you're not cheating on the test.",

OGLETREE , \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nv. \n CLEVELAND STATE U NIVERSITY , \n \nDefendant.  \n ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n Case No. 1:21-cv-00500  \n Judge J. Philip Calabrese  \n  \nAMENDED OPINION AND ORDER  \n Even before the Covid -19 pandemic, Cleveland State University offered \ncourses online and used various methods to ensure the integrity of remote tests.  One \nmethod involves using a student’s camera briefly to scan the test taker’s surroundings \nfor potential  impermissible study aids or notes.  Plaintiff Aaron Ogletree, a student \nat Cleveland State University, filed suit alleging that this practice or policy violated \nhis rights when a proctor asked him to conduct a room scan of his bedroom before \nstarting a re mote test.   \nPlaintiff and Defendant each move for summary judgment.  For the following \nreasons, the Court DENIES  Defendant’s motion for summary judgment  (ECF No. 29)  \nand GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion  (ECF No. 30) .  In this Amended Opinion and Order, \nthe Court also  addresses Plaintiff’s m otion for a permanent injunction ( ECF No. 41)  \nand incorporates the clarifications referenced in its Opinion and Order ( see ECF \nNo. 49) on Defendant’s motion for reconsideration  (ECF No. 42) .   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  1 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>2 STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n This case arises out of a scan Cleveland State University conducted of a \nstudent’s bedroom in connection with a remote test Mr. Ogletree  took for one of his \nclasses.   The record contains the following facts, which are largely undisputed.   \nA. Cleveland State’s Remote  Testing Policies \nCleveland State University offers some classes remotely.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 11, \nPageID #146; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 11, PageID #160.)  In May 2016, Cleveland State  \npublished campus -wide guidelines for online classes in a document titled “ Required  \nProcedures & Recommended  Practices to Address Security and Quality of eLearning \nCourses.”   ( ECF No. 25 -2, PageID #330.)   One of the purposes of t he document was \nto ensure the integrity of remote tests.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #268.)  \nA required procedure mandates that students taking online classes have a \nphotograph in Cleveland State’s database  at the time of registration  so as “to \neliminate impersonation and to ensure that the same student enrolled in the course \nis attending the online lectures and taking the exams.”  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID \n#273– 74; ECF No.  25-2, PageID #330 .)  However, Cleveland State does not enforce \nthis procedure , and some students taking online classes do not have a photograph in \nthe database.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #272 –74.) \nIn addition to requir ed procedures, the University’s recommended practices \nleave testing “to the faculty member’s discretion to implement.”  ( ECF No. 25 -2, \nPageID #331.)   Some recommended practices include randomiz ing the order of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  2 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>3 questions, us ing timed tests, and using  remote proctoring tools.  ( Id., PageID \n#331– 32.)   \nAs remote pro ctoring tools, Cleveland State  offers several programs  designed \nto enhance  “online test security and proctoring.”  ( Id., PageID #332.)  For instance, \nCleveland State’s  learning management system , Blackboard , offers a plagiarism \ndetection system  and generat es reports “that faculty can use to see more information \nabout student activity, including  the IP address from where they logged in, how much \ntime they spent in the exam .”  (ECF No. 25 -1, Page ID #262– 63 & 312 .)  Cleveland \nState also uses the proctoring tools R espondus  and Honorlock.  ( Id., PageID # 291.)  \nFor Respondus, Respondus LockDown Browser prevents students from accessing the \ninternet or using other computer programs during a remote test, w hile R espondus \nMonitor records the student taking the exam  and uses artificial intelligence to flag \nsuspicious activity .  (Id., PageID # 305–06 & 321 .)  Similarly, Honorlock uses a \nstudent’s camera  and artificial intelligence monitoring.   (Id., PageID #299.)   Among \nthese remote proctoring tools, faculty members have discretion to choose which tool \nor combination of tools, if any, a re necessary to preserve the integrity of the remote \nexam.  ( Id., PageID #275 –76 & 295 .) \nB. Cleveland State ’s Use of Room Scans  \nCleveland State neither requires nor  recommends the use of a room scan  \npursuant to any written policy .  (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #277.)   In a non- proctored \nexam, there is no room scan.  ( Id., PageID #283.)   However, each of the online \nproctoring tools that Cleveland State  uses, Respondus and Honorlock, requires a Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  3 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>4 room scan as part of its prerecorded instructions.  ( Id., PageID #291– 93.)  For in-\nperson proctored exams , the test coordinator at Cleveland State University  Testing \nServices informed Mr. Ogletree  by email that it has a process of performing a “cursory \nreview of [the student’s] immediate testing space,” and “[a]ll students, regardless of \nthe course or instructor, are asked to do this as part of the check -in process.”   (ECF \nNo. 26 -7, PageID #413.)    \nWhen a student takes an o nline exam , it proceeds as follows.  First, at the \noutset of a  proctored online exam, whether proctored through an electronic \napplication or an actual person , students must “show thei r ID next to their face so \nyou can clearly see and read the ID and be able to tell that that person is the same \nperson that is on the ID.”  (ECF No.  25-1, PageID #282 ; ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #202.)   \nSecond , either the proctoring application or the proctor prompt s the student to \nconduct a room scan of his  environment.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #282 ; ECF No. 24 -1, \nPageID #211 .)  Other students taking the remote test can see the room scans of other \nstudents.  (ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #212.)  \nThe proctor who performed the room scan at issue in this case testified that \nher supervisor, the Cleveland State Testing Services ’ test coordinator,  instructed her \nto perform the room scan.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #214.)  Further, the proctor \npresumed that a room scan was required unless the professor in the class instructed otherwise.  ( Id., PageID #215.)  As to whether students may re fuse to conduct the \nroom scan, the proctor testified that she never had a student refuse , and she was not \naware of a Cleveland State policy addressing how to handle a student’s refusal.  ( Id., Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  4 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>5 PageID #213.)   The proctor testified that in the event of a refusal, she would allow \nthe student to take the test but notify the professor that the student refused to \nperform the room scan.  ( Id.) \nC. Mr. Ogletree’s Enrollment at Cleveland State  \n At the time of the events relevant to this action, Mr. Ogletree studied \nchemistry at Cleveland State University.  ( ECF No. 26 -1, PageID #352.)  For the \nspring 2021 semester , Mr. Ogletree enrolled in five classes .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 39,  \nPageID #1 49–50.)  Due to the Covi d-19 pandemic, most Cleveland State classes \nduring the spring 2021 semester were conducted remotely.  ( ECF No. 1 , ¶ 40, PageID \n#150; ECF No.  19, ¶ 40, PageID #163.)    \nIn the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that during the spring 2021 semester, \nCleveland State required students to complete and pass a “Daily Health Assessment” \nto attend a class in -person  on campus .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 42,  PageID #150.)   Attending \nclasses in person was not an option for him, Plai ntiff says, because of “various health \nissues that impact his immune system and put him at particular risk to the COVID \npandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 45, PageID #150.)   Further, “[b]ecause of his health issues, \nOgletree does not pass the Daily Health Assessment” ; therefore , according to the \ncomplaint, Cleveland State would not permit him to take his tests in -person on \ncampus .  (Id., ¶¶ 46 & 47 , PageID #150.)   Plaintiff also alleged he has “family \nmembers who are at high -risk to the pandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 48, PageID #150.)  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  5 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>6 D. The Room Scan  \nIn January 2021, Mr. Ogletree disputed a policy contained in the syllabus for \nhis General Chemistry II class.  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 49, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 49, \nPageID #164.)   The policy stated:   “The proctors and I reserve the right to ask any \nstudent, before, during, or after an exam to show their surroundings, screen, and/or \nwork area.  We will  send you a private chat to ask you to do this.  If you do not see \nthe chat message, I will use the microphone to ask you to check the chat.”  ( Id.)  Three \ndays later, the Professor removed the policy  from the syllabus.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 50, \nPageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 50, PageID #164.)   \n On February 17, 2021, Mr. Ogletree had a General Chemistry II re mote test \nscheduled for 12:30 pm.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 51, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 51, PageID \n#164.)  At the time, Mr. Ogletree li ved with his mother and two siblings, who were all \nhome when Mr. Ogletree took the chemistry exam.  ( ECF No. 26 -1, PageID #354 –55.)  \nCleveland State requires students to take remote tests in a  location where they will \nbe alone and uninterrupted.  ( ECF No. 17 , PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , PageID #165.)  \nMr. Ogletree testifi ed that his bedroom was the only suitable testing environment.  \n(ECF No. 26 -1, PageID #366.)   \nThat morning, at 10:25 am, almost two hours before the scheduled exam, \nCleveland State Testing Services emailed Mr. Ogletree to inform him  that the proctor \nwould be “checking your ID, your surroundings and your materials.”  ( ECF No. 26 -5, \nPageID #4 09.)  At 10:40 am, Mr. Ogletree replied to the email.  ( Id.)  Mr. Ogletree \nexplained that he “currently [had] confidential settlement documents in the form of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  6 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>7 late arriving 1099s scattered about [his] work area and there is not enough time to \nsecure them.”  ( Id.)  \n At the start of the exam, the proctor asked Mr. Ogletree to perform a room scan \nof his bedroom , and Mr. Ogletree complied.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #226.)  The scan \nlasted less than a minute , and as little as ten to twenty seconds .  (Id., PageID #227 ; \nECF No. 26 -1, PageID #368 .)  The proctor testified that she did not see any tax \ndocuments or medications.   (ECF No.  24-1, PageID #239 –40.) \n The room scan and the test were recorded,  and the video recording was \nretained by Cleveland State’s third- party  vendor.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301.)  \nCleveland State is not aware of any dat a breaches related to remote exam  recordings , \nand access to the video is strictly controlled.   (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301; ECF No. \n24-1, PageID #236 –37.) \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n Based on these facts, Plaintiff  alleges  that Defendant violated his rights under \nthe Fourth Amendment and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief.  ( ECF No. 17 , \nPageID #152 –53.)  Both Plaintiff and Defendant move  for summary judgment.   (ECF \nNos. 29 & 30.)  \nANALYSIS  \nPurs uant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary \njudgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.  R. \nCiv. P. 56(a).  On a  motion for summary judgment, the Court must view evidence in Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  7 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>8 the light most favorable to the non -moving party.  Kirilenko -Ison v. Board of Educ. of \nDanville Indep. Schs., 974 F.3d 652, 660 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Matsushita Elec. \nIndus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenit h Radio Corp ., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)).  Ultimately, the \nCourt must determine whether “ one party must prevail as a matter of law.”  Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 242, 251 (1986) .   \nI. Fourth Amendment  Searches  \nThe Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.”  \nU.S. Const. amend. IV; United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 404 (2012).  Plaintiff \ncontends t hat Cleveland State’s policy of conducting warrantless room scans of \nstudents’ homes violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable \nsearches as it applies to the State of Ohio through the Fourteenth Amendment.  ( ECF \nNo. 17 , PageID #153.)   \n At the outset, the parties contest whether the remote virtual room scans at \nissue qualify as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Specifically, \nthey debate whether the Four th Amendment applies under Wyman v. James, 400 \nU.S. 309 (1971), and its progeny.   \nI.A. General  Principles \n A Fourth Amendment search “occurs when the government violates a \nsubjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.”  Kyllo v.  \nUnited States, 533 U.S. 27, 33 (2001) (citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361 \n(1967) ).  Even in the expressly  protected location of a house, which receives Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  8 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>9 heightened protection under the Fourth Amendment , a search within the meaning of \nthe Const itution does not occur unless “the individual manifested a subjective \nexpectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,” and society is “willing \nto recognize that expectation as reasonable.”  Id.  (citing California v. Ciraolo , 47 U.S. \n207, 211 (1986)).  \nPlaintiff contends  that the  remote room  scans at issue are Fourth Amendment \nsearches because students have a subjective expectation of privacy in their houses , \nand especially in their bedrooms, and society recognizes that expectation as \nreasonable.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #499.)  In response , Defendant maintains  that \nPlaintiff’s subjective expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable.   (ECF \nNo. 34, PageID #512.)   Defendant points  to evidence showing that room  scans are \n“standard industry wide practice” and that students frequently acquiesce in  their use.  \n(ECF No. 34 , PageID #512– 14.)   \nAlthough the record shows that no student, other than Mr. Ogletree, ever \nobjected to the scans ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #213), the facts  also implicate the core \nplaces where society, to the exten t it can agree on much  these days , recognizes \nreasonable and legitimate privacy interests —namely, the home.  Though schools may \nroutinely employ remote technology to peer into houses without objection from some, \nmost, or nearly  all students, it does not follow that others might not object to the \nvirtual intrusion into their homes or that the routine use of a practice such as room scans does not violate a privacy interest that society recognize s as reasonable, both \nfactually and legally.  Therefore, the Court determines that Mr. Ogletree’s subjective Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  9 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>10 expectation of privacy at issue is one that society views as reasonable and that lies at \nthe core of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against governmental intrusion.  \nTo support the argument that the expectation of privacy Plaintiff claims is \nobjectively unreasonable, Defendant relies on several  cases.  First , Defendant argues \nthat the room  scans are  not searches because they are routine .  For this proposition, \nDefendant cites Califor nia v. Ciraolo , 476 U.S. 207, 215 (1986) , in which the Supreme \nCourt held that it was unreasonable to expect that marijuana plants were \nconstitutionally protected from being observed from an altitude of 1,000 feet “in an \nage where private and commercial  flight in the public airways is routine.”   See also \nFlorida v. Riley , 488 U.S. 445, 449 –50 (1989) (same).   In Ciraolo and Riley , due to  \nmodern  flight  technology and its routine use, the marijuana plants were  openly  \nobservable.   These cases build on the traditional notion that governmental officials, \nlawfully in a public place, do not conduct unlawful searches simply by  observ ing \nthings  in plain view.  But the room scans peer behind walls and make visible places \noutside the ambit of cases such as Ciraolo and Riley .  Rooms scans go where people \notherwise would not, at least not without a warrant or an invitation.  \nNor does it follow that room  scans are not searches because the technolog y is \n“in general public use.”  Defendant cites Kyllo, 533 U.S. at 34– 40, in which the \nSupreme Court held that law enforcement’s use of thermal imaging technology  not \n“in general public use” to explore the interior of the home constituted  a Fourth \nAmendment search .  But t he Supreme Court did not  hold the inverse —that the use \nof a technology “in general public use”  could not be a Fourth Amendment search.   To Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  10 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>11 the contrary, Katz  held, as relevant here, that the procedural antecedents to a search \nthat the Constitution requires apply even where new technologies make accessible \nplaces and information not otherwise obtainable without a physical intrusion.   389 \nU.S. at 359.   While cameras  might  be generally a vailable  and now commonly used , \nmembers of the public cannot use  them  to see into a n office , house, or other place not \npublicly visible  without the owner’s consent.   \nFinally, Defendant cites  City of Ontario, California v. Quon , 560 U.S. 746  \n(2010), in whic h the Supreme Court considered the privacy  expectations of \ngovernmental employees in communications made on electronic equipment  that the \nemployer  owns .  T here, t he Court observed that rapid changes related to \ncommunications were evident in both the techno logy and “what society accepts as \nproper behavior” and noted that the “operational realities of the workplace” might \nbear on the reasonableness of an employee ’s expectation of privacy.   Id. at 756 –59.  \nBut Quon arose within the  particular context of the employment relationship .  \nAlthough the truism that technological change affects the degree of privacy that society accepts as reasonable has broader application, Quon and the cases that \nfollowed it have not extended this principle beyond th e employment context.  Any \ndecision to do so properly lies with another court , particularly if doing so pares back \nconstitutional protections across different areas of the law .   \nFollowing Katz , Fourth Amendment jurisprudence examines an individual’s \nexpec tation of privacy in a particular place .  The ubiquity  of a particular technolog y \nor its application s does not directly bear on that analysis .  Here, the room  scan Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  11 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>12 occurred in Plaintiff’s house —in his bedroom, in fact .  At the Fourth Amendment’s \n“very core ” lies “the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from \nunreasonable governmental intrusion.”  Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. 1, 6 (2013) \n(citing Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511 (1961) ).  Consistent with \nestablished precedent, the Court determines that Plaintiff  had an objectively \nreasonable expectation of privacy in his home —and one that society recognizes as \nreasonable .  \nI.B. Searches Under Wyman  v. James  \nAdditionally , Defendant  contends that the room scans are not “searches” \nbecause they are limited in scope, conducted for a regulatory or administrative \npurpose, and not coerced.   (ECF No. 29 , PageID #46 2–66.)  In support of the \nproposition that these attributes remove the room  scans from the ambit of the Fourth \nAmendment, Defendant relies on Wyman v. James, 400 U.S. 309  (1971) , and its \nprogeny.  \n In Wyman , the Supreme C ourt considered whether a welfare beneficiary may \nrefuse a home visit by her  caseworker without risking the termination of benefits.  \n400 U.S. at 310.   The Wyman Court specifically considered the heightened  protection \nthe Fourth Amendment affords to the privacy of the home and noted that “one’s  \nFourth Amendment protection subsists apart from his being suspected of criminal \nbehavior .”  Id. at 316  (citing Camara v. Municipal Ct ., 387 U.S. 523, 528 –30 (1967)) .  \nNonetheless, t he Court held  that this “protective attitude” in the law was not a factor \nin the case because the home visit was not a search in the Fourth Amendment sense .  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  12 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>13 Id. at 318.  Though State law made the visit mandatory for continu ing benefits  and \nthe visit served both rehabilitative and investigative purposes , the Court concluded  \nthat the visit could not be equated with a search in the traditional criminal law \ncontext.  Id.   Indeed , the visit wa s not forced or compelled, the beneficiary’s denial of \npermission was not a criminal act, and if the beneficiary did not consent then the \nvisitation did not occur and the aid “merely cease[d] .”  Id. \n The other cases Defendant cites stem from Wyman .  In S.L. v. Whitburn , 67 \nF.3d 1299 , 1307 (7th Cir. 1995) , and Sanchez v. C ity of San Diego , 464 F.3d 916, \n920–23 (9th Cir. 2006) , the Seventh and Ninth Circuit s noted  that they were bound \nby Wyman  and held  that home visits made pursuant to the administration of welfare \nbenefits  were not searches under the Fourt h Amendment.   See also  Schmid v. City of \nSonoma , No. 19 -cv-00883, 2021 WL 1118077, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2021)  \n(upholding denial of an exemption for refusal to consent to a permit -related inspection \non the grounds that the inspections were not Fourth Amendment searches under \nWyman ).  Similarly, i n Marcavage v. Borough of Lansdowne, P ennsylvania, 493 F. \nApp’x 301 (3d Cir. 2012) , the court  upheld an ordinance  authorizing denial of a rental \nlicense if the property owner refused to consent to an inspection .  The Third Circuit \nreasoned that the ordinance “requires a limited search by the city official for the specific purpose of receiving a benefit under the law,”  which is constitutional under \nWyman .  Id.  at 306.  \n Based on Wyman ’s differentiation between investigations and Fourth \nAmendment searches, Defendant advances several reasons why its room  scans of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  13 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>14 students’ homes  are not searches.  First, Defendant conducted the scan for the \nregulatory purpose of protecting exam integrity, not for any purpose related to \ncriminality.  ( ECF No. 29 , PageID #463.)  Second, the scan was not coerced because \nPlaintiff was free to object to the scan or refuse to perform it.  ( Id.)  A student who \nrefused to conduct the exam could stil l take the test  and, even if failure to conduct \nthe scan resulted in not getting credit for the exam, that consequence is  less severe \nthan the loss of welfare benefits in Wyman .  (Id., PageID #464 –65.)  Third, the scan \nwas limited in scope because it was brief , only revealed items in plain view , and the \nstudent controlled the inspection to the extent that the student chose where in the \nhouse to take the exam and where in the room to direct the camera  during the scan.  \n(Id., PageID #463 –64.)  Defendant argue s that the room  scan was less intrusive  than \nthe home visits in Wyman  because no State officer physically entered Plaintiff’s home , \nDefendant told Plaintiff of the scan two hours in advance, and Plaintiff could choose \nthe part of the home  to be inspected and remove any  private matters from plain view.  \n(Id., PageID #464 .)   \n Plaintiff responds that Defendant overreads Wyman .  (ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#500.)   Plaintiff points to the Sixth Circuit’s holding in Andrews v. Hickman County, \nTenn essee, 700 F.3d 845 (6th Cir. 2012).  There, the court considered whether social \nworkers who conducted a warrantless home visit in a child abuse investigation were \nentitled to qualified immunity.  The Sixth Circuit noted that the Fourth Amendment’s \nrestrictions on unreasonable searches extended to the “activities of civil as well as criminal a uthorities.”  Id. at 858– 59 (citing New Jersey v. T.L.O ., 469 U.S. 325, 335 Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  14 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>15 (1985) ).  Describing case law from other circuits , the c ourt referenced a case in which \nthe Ninth Circuit declined to exempt social workers investigating allegations of child \nabuse  from the Fourth Amendment by distinguishing Wyman as mak ing “receipt of \na requested welfare benefit contingent on the grant of entry for a search intended to \nconfirm that the monies were being used in the recipient child ’s interest, where the \nentry under the state program was of a limited and consensual nature, and the \nrequirement applied to all recipients .”  Id.  at 859 (citing Calabretta v. Floyd , 189 F.3d \n808, 816 (9th Cir. 1999) ).  “Given the presumption that state actors are governed by \nthe Fourt h Amendment and the sanctity of the home under the Fourth Amendment,” \nthe Sixth Circuit held  that social workers were governed by the Fourth Amendment’s \nwarrant requirement.   700 F.3d at 859.  \n Plaintiff argues that Andrews shows that Wyman did not create a Fourth \nAmendment exception for civil authorities.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #501.)   Rather, \nlongstanding  precedent establishes that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches \nconducted for noncrimi nal purposes , especially in the home .  (ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#501– 02.)  Further, Plaintiff maintains that it is well establishe d that the Fourth \nAmendment applies to all intrusions into a privat e home, however limited.  ( Id., \nPageID #50 2–03.)  Defendant does not dispute that the Fourth Amendment  gives \nheightened protection to  the home or that the Fourth Amendment applies in \nnoncriminal matters.  ( ECF No. 35 , PageID #533.)   However, Defendant argues  that \nthe Wyman Court considered both of those points and , nonethel ess, determined that \nno Fourth Amendment search occurred.  ( Id.) Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  15 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>16  Wyman  dates to 1971,  more than fifty years ago .  Since then, society, \ntechnology, and Fourth Amendment jurisprudence have changed markedly.  In the \ncases applying Wyman on which Defendant re lies, courts applied Wyman in the \ncontext of upholding termination or denial of a benefit following the beneficiary’s \nrefusal to consent to an inspection, where refusal triggered no penalties except the \ntermination or denial of benefits.  In this respect, the Sixth Circuit’s decision in \nAndrews, quoting Calabretta from the Ninth Circuit, accurately reads this line of \ncases as applying to a fairly distinct set of circumstances materially different from  \nthose at issue here:  making welfare benefits contingent , for all recipients, on a \nlimited and consensual search to confirm expenditure of the funds for the interest of a child.  In contrast , unlike Wyman  and its progeny, this case involves the privilege \nof college admission and attendance and does not involve a benefit made available to \nall citizens as of right.  Additionally, the record here shows a variable policy —\nenforced, unevenl y, in the discretion of a combination of proctors and professors —of \nusing remote scans that make a student’s home visible , including to other students , \nwith uncertain consequences .   \n Finally, the Court addresses Plaintiff ’s argument that New Jersey v. T.L.O. , \n469 U.S. 325 (1985), provides the proper standard for  the constitutionality of searches \nthat school officials  conduct .  (ECF No. 33 , PageID #503.)  In  T.L.O., the Supreme \nCourt  held that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches by school officials , with \nsome accommodation to respond to the needs of the educ ational environment and \nassess the legality of those searches .  Id.  at 341 –42.  But T.L.O. does not speak to the Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  16 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>17 threshold question of when a school official’s actions constitute a search within the \nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment.   Accordingly, the Court need  not address T.L.O.  \non this question.    \n* * * \n For these reasons, the Court concludes that the Fourth Amendment applies to \nthe virtual room scans Cleveland State uses.  Holding otherwise, as Defendant \nargues, raises even more difficult questions about what legal standard, if any, governs \nthe scans and the potential consequences of such a ruling in other areas of life  and \nthe law  that technology touches.  \nII.  Fourth Amendment Reasonableness  \n The Fourth Amendment proscribes only those sear ches that are unreasonable.  \nHaving held  that the room  scans are searches for purposes of  the Fourth Amendment, \nthe Court turns to whether the scans a re reasonable.   Whether a particular search \nmeets the reasonableness standard “is judged by balancing its intrusion on the \nindividual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate \ngovernmental interests.”  Skinner v. Railway Labor Exec s.’ Ass’n , 489 U.S. 602, 619 \n(1989) (quoting Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648,  654 (1979) ).  Although the Fo urth \nAmendment mandates that no warrant may issue except on a showing of probable \ncause, that requirement is not absolute.   A warrant is not required in every case.   \nNational Treasury Emps. Union v. Von Raab , 489 U.S. 656, 665  (1989) .  As the text \nof the F ourth Amendment makes clear, the Constitution protects against \nunreasonable searches and seizures, making reasonableness the ultimate touchstone Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  17 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>27 Moreover, the record contains no evidence that other students have not consented to \nroom scans or have circu mstances like Mr. Ogletree’s.  Indeed, in the record before \nthe Court, Mr. Ogletree made the only complaint or objection to the room scans.  \nAccordingly, t his case does not  raise a  concern of serial litigation that might \noverwhelm the courts.   \n For these reasons, the Court determines that a remedy that extends to other \nstudents would be overly broad and is unnecessary to provide Mr. Ogletree the relief \nto which he is entitled.  See Sharpe, 319 F.3d at 273.  To be sure, the relief requested \n“will benefit not only the claimant but all other persons subject to the practice or the \nrule under attack.”  7A Wright & Miller,  Federal Practice and Procedure § 1771 (4th \ned. 2008) .  Other students might well avail themselves of the Court’s ruling, but \nadjudicating any such claims preemptively by extending the remedy would be \npremature.   \nIII.B. Remedies  \n Against that background, the Court considers  each of the remedies Plaintiff \nseeks.  \nIII.B.1. Declaratory Judgment  \n“[I]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction,” except for certain \ncircumstances not relevant here, the Court “ may declare the rights and other legal \nrelations of any interested party seeking such declaration, w hether or not further \nrelief is or could be sought .”  28 U.S.C. §  2201(a); see also Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, \n387 U.S. 136, 142 (1967).   Accordingly, Plaintiff is entitled to a declaratory judgment.  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  27 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>28 Based on its prior Opinion and Order, as amended, the Court declares that \nPlaintiff Aaron Ogletree has rights under the Fourth Amendment, which appl y to the \nroom scans Cleveland State uses in the administration of remote exams and other \nassessments, and that Mr. Ogletree’s privacy interest in his home outweighs \nCleveland State’s interest s in scanning his room.  Accordingly, the Court grants \ndeclaratory relief to Plaintiff.  As discussed, this ruling might incidentally benefit \nother students as well.  As a formal matter, however, the Court limits this declaration \nto Mr. Ogletree as the party -in-interest who brought suit against Cleveland State.   \nIII.B. 2. Injunction  \nGenerally,  before a court  may issue  a permanent  injunction,  a plaintiff  must  \ndemonstrate:   (1) he has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) the remedies available at \nlaw, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; \n(3) considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a \nremedy in equity is warranted; a nd (4) a permanent injunction serve s the public \ninterest.  eBay  Inc. v. MercExchange,  L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006) (citations \nomitted).  Essentially, this standard mirrors the considerations governing the \nissuance of a preliminary injunction, except th at the plaintiff must also show actual  \nsuccess on the merits.  Amoco  Prod.  Co. v. Village  of Gambell , 480 U.S. 531, 546 n.12 \n(1987).  While a court balances these fact ors, it must consider each of them, and “ even  \nthe strongest  showing  on the other  three  factors  cannot  eliminate  the irreparable  \nharm  requirement.”   D.T. v. Sumner  Cnty. Sch., 942 F.3d 324, 326– 27 (6th Cir. 2019) \n(quotation omitted).   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  28 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>29 For the reasons discussed, Plaintiff proved his claim of a Fourth Amendment \nviolation and established actual success on the merits.  W here a plaintiff establishes \nthe merits of his  claim, he need only show (1) a continuing irreparable injury if the \ncourt fails to issue the injunction and (2) the lack of an adequate remedy at law.  \nKallstrom  v. City of Columbus , 136 F.3d 1055, 1067 (6th Cir. 1998).  Mr. Ogletree \nproved an irreparable injury from th e governmental intrusion into his \nconstitutionally protected home, however briefly .  See Overstreet v. Lexington -Fayette \nUrb. Cnty. Gov ’t, 305 F.3d 566, 578 (6th Cir. 2002)  (citing , among other authorities,  \nCovino v. Patrissi , 967 F.2d 73, 77 (2d Cir.  1992) (holding that plaintiffs may establish \nirreparable harm based on violation of their Fourth Amendment  rights) ).  Defendant \nobjects that Mr. Ogletree should not receive an injunction because he lacks an ongoing need.  ( ECF No. 47 , PageID #613.)  In Defendant’s view, it is enough that \nCleveland State has  exempted him from all room scans “until this case is resolved.”  \n(Id., PageID #615.)  But Mr. Ogletree’s constitutional rights do not depend on the \ngrace of Cleveland State.  The Court sees no reason not to make this voluntary interim measure permanent.  So long as Mr.  Ogletree remains enrolled at Cleveland \nState, he remains subject to future room scans that threaten his rights.   \nAs for a remedy at law, the Eleventh Amendment bars an award of damages.  \nSee Platte v. Thomas Twp. , 504 F. Supp. 2d 227, 247 (E.D. Mich. 2007) .  Even if it did \nnot, the Court is hard -pressed  to quantify the damages flowing from the \nconstitutional violatio n at issue.  The remaining factors also favor the issuance of a \npermanent injunction.  In the  balance of hardships, the Court finds that the risk of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 50  Filed:  12/20/22  29 of 31.  PageID #: <pageID>30 continuing constitutional violations  from the use of room scans that intrude into \nMr. Ogletree’s home outweighs any burden on Cleveland State from using alternative \nmethods to advance its legitimate interests in ensuring the integrity of tests, securing \nconsent, or otherwise implementing room scans that do not violate the Fourth \nAmendment .  See Cole v. City of Memphis , Tenn. , 108 F. Supp. 3d 593, 607 (W.D. \nTenn. 2015) .  Finally , “it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a \nparty’s constitutional rights. ”  G & V Lounge, I nc. v. Michigan Liquor Control \nComm’n , 23 F.3d 1071, 1079 (6th Cir. 1994) (citations omitted) .  \n* * * \n Balancing the equities, the Court permanently enjoins Cleveland State, in \nconnection with any exam, test, or other assessment, from subjecting Mr. Ogletr ee to \na room scan that  is administered without offering a reasonable alternative or, \nalternatively, without his express consent.   \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES  Defendant’s motion for \nsummary judgment and GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion .  Further, the Court  ISSUES A \nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT and PERMANENTLY ENJOINS Cleveland State \nfrom violating Mr. Ogletree’s Fourth Amendment rights as stated in this Amended \nOpinion and Or der.   \n SO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   In *RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes*, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s grant of a preliminary injunction against Keith Gerdes for breaching his employment agreement with RGIS and misappropriating trade secrets. Gerdes resigned from RGIS to work for a competitor, in violation of his non-compete clause, and failed to respond timely to RGIS's preliminary injunction motion. The court found Gerdes showed a lack of trustworthiness and supported RGIS's claim of threatened misappropriation. The case mentions plans for future use of artificial intelligence as part of RGIS's strategic business information, highlighting its involvement in trade secret claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n   Whether the district court correctly issued a preliminary injunction against Gerdes based on claims of breach of a non-compete clause and misappropriation of trade secrets.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court upheld the preliminary injunction, affirming that RGIS demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its trade secret misappropriation claim and that Gerdes's employment agreement waiver provided strong grounds against his personal jurisdiction defense.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine if you worked at a secret candy factory that used robots to make special candies and you promised not to tell anyone how they do it when you leave. Instead, you go to work at another candy company and take a company laptop with you. The factory sues you because you could accidentally spill their secrets, and a judge says you can't work for the new company for a year, must return the laptop, and must keep the secrets safe. The appeals court agreed, saying you can't complain you weren't heard in court because you didn't respond in time.",

RGIS, LLC, a company  headquartered in Michigan , offers a \nvariety of inventory -related  services to business customers  around  the world .  Keith Gerdes \nworked for RGIS  from California  for 30 years , eventually  becom ing a regional vice president  on \nthe operations side of the company .  Gerdes left RGIS in May 2019 .  An RGIS official said that \nGerdes  told the company that he was resigning  to allow for more “personal time .”  But Gerdes  \nimmediately accepted the position of  Vice President of U.S. Operations with one of RGIS’s main  \ncompetitors.  RGIS did not take kindly to this development because Gerdes’s employment \nagreement barred him  from  accept ing a job  with a competitor for one year after leaving RGIS  and \nrequired him t o keep confidential certain RGIS business information.  RGIS also believed that \nGerdes failed to return a company laptop.        Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 1No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n2 \n In June 2019, RGIS sued Gerdes in a Michigan district court  for breaching the employment \nagreement  and misappropriating trade secrets .  RGIS also filed a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction; Gerdes responded with a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and a \nmotion to delay the injunction proceedings until after a decision on th e motion to dismiss.  Gerdes \nnever formally  respon ded to the motion for a preliminary injunction.  At a hearing the court denied \nGerdes’s requested  delay, and Gerdes  then characterized  his motion to dismiss as an opposition to \nthe preliminary -injunction motion.  The court granted the preliminary injunction .  The injunction \nbarred Gerdes from working at the competitor until a year after he left RGIS , required Gerdes to \nreturn any property that belonged to RGIS , and prohibited Gerdes from disclosing any RGIS trade \nsecrets.  RGIS, LLC v.  Gerdes , 2019 WL 3958392, at * 8 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 21, 2019).  \nGerdes  now raises three arguments  on appeal.  Each argument fails, so we affirm.  \nCourts consider four familiar factors when deciding whether to grant a preliminary \ninjunction : (1) whether the plai ntiff is likely to succeed on the merits; (2)  whether the plaintiff will \nsuffer irreparable harm; (3)  whether the balance of the equities tips in the plaintiff’s favor; and \n(4) whether an injunction is in the public interest.  See Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008).  On appeal, we review de novo the district court’s conclusion on  the first factor, \nbut we review  under the abuse -of-discretion standard the district court’s ultimate decision  about \nwhether the preliminary -injunction factors favor granting or denying an injunction.  Babler v. \nFuthey , 618 F.3d 514, 519 –20 (6th Cir. 2010) ; see D.T. v. Sumner Cty. Schs. , 942 F.3d 324, 327 \n(6th Cir. 2019) ; York Risk Servs. Grp., Inc. v . Couture , 787 F.  App’x 301, 305 (6th Cir. 2019).  \n1.  Motion Procedure .  Gerdes argues that the district court  abused its discretion by ruling \non RGIS’s  preliminary -injunction motion without giving him an opportunity to respond.  We see \nno error , let alone an abuse of discret ion.  To begin with, Gerdes did have  an opportunity to       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 2No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n3 \n respond; he simply failed to take it .  RGIS filed its motion on July 1, 2019 , and the court quickly \nset a hearing for August 14.  Local rules gave Gerdes 21 days to respond.  E. Dist. of Mich. L.R. \n7.1(e)(1)(B).   Gerdes filed nothing until July 29, the date on which he moved to dismiss for lack \nof personal jurisdiction.  And he did not file his motion to delay ruling on the preliminary -\ninjunction motion until August 8.  In addition, t he district court could look at Gerdes’s requested \ndelay with a skeptical eye .  He was simultaneously  working for RGIS’s competitor in what RGIS \nbelieved to be a clear breach of contract  and so had every incentive to avoid an injunction ruling .  \nNot only that , Gerdes told the district court at the hearing that his motion to dismiss was “actually” \nan opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction.  All told,  the court gave Gerdes enough  \ntime to respond, had good reason not to delay things further, and went out of its way to allow  \nGerdes to use  his motion -to-dismiss argument s to oppose the injunction.  It committed  no \nprocedural error.  See Blue v. Hartford Life & Acc ident  Ins. Co. , 698 F.3d 587, 593 –95 (7th Cir. \n2012);  cf. Prime Rate Premium Fin. Corp., Inc. v. Larson , 930 F.3d 759, 766–67 (6th Cir. 2019).  \n2.  Personal Jurisdiction .  Gerdes , a Californian, next argues that the Michigan district \ncourt should have denied the injunction for one overarching reason —that RGIS does not have a \nlikelihood o f success because  the district court lacks personal jurisdiction over  him.  Yet RGIS \nshowed that it would  likely rebut  this personal -jurisdiction defense  based on a waiver in the parties’ \nemployment agreement .  Cf. Ins. Corp. of Ireland Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee , 456 \nU.S. 694, 703 –04 (1982).   Although  Gerdes does not live in  Michigan, he signed an agreement \nwith a forum -selection clause stating that any dispute  arising from that agreement  “shall and must \nbe filed in” a state or fed eral court in Michigan .  RGIS , 2019 WL 3958392, at *3.  By signing this \nagreement, Gerdes consented to litigating  in the district court and likely waived his right to \nchallenge the district court’s personal jurisdiction over him.  See Stone Surgical, LLC v . Stryker       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 3No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n4 \n Corp. , 858 F.3d 383, 388 –89 (6th Cir. 2017); Preferred Capital, Inc. v. Assocs. in Urology , \n453 F.3d 718, 721 (6th Cir. 2006).  Gerdes’s  personal -jurisdiction defense thus provides no basis \nfor overturning the preliminary injunction.  \n3.  RGIS’s  Substantive Claims .  Gerdes lastly  argues that the district court wrongly grant ed \nan injunction based on  RGIS’s  breach -of-contract and misappropriation -of-trade -secrets claims.  \nWe disagree on both fronts.  \nGerdes initially asserts  that Michigan cour ts would not enforce his employment \nagreement’s noncompete provision because it is overbroad.  But the passage of time  has made  it \nunnecessary for us to resolve  this state-law contract question.  The part of t he preliminary \ninjunction  enforcing Gerdes’s on e-year noncompete  expired by its own terms in May 2020, one \nyear after Gerdes  left RGIS .  Because that part of the injunction no longer applies , we “have no \nway to grant [the requested] relief [.]”  Radiant Glob . Logistics, Inc. v. Furstenau , 951 F.3d 393, \n395–96 (6th Cir. 2020)  (per curiam).  Gerdes ’s challenge to this part of the injunction is thus moot.  \nId.; see also Hodges v. Schlinkert Sports Assocs., Inc. , 89 F.3d 310, 312 (6th Cir. 1996).  \nGerdes next asser ts that the district court  mistakenly grant ed an injunction prohibiting him \nfrom misappropriatin g RGIS’s trade  secrets.  The district court did not abuse its discretion in \ngranting this part of the injunction.  We s tart with the “ all-important likelihood -of-success ” factor , \na factor that we review de novo .  S. Glazer’s Distribs. of Ohio, LLC v. Great Lakes Brewing Co. , \n860 F.3d 844, 849, 854 (6th Cir. 2017).  \nRGIS brought claims under both federal  and state law.  The Michigan Uniform Trade \nSecret s Act  permits courts to enjoin the “[a]ctual or threatened misappropriation” of a trade secret.  \nMich. Comp. Laws §  445.1903 (1).  The Act  defines “misappropriation” to include the \n“[d]isclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied  consent by a person       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 4No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n5 \n who” “knew or had reason to know that his or her knowledge of the trade secret was . . . acquired \nunder circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use [.]”  Id. \n§ 445.1902(b) (ii)(B).  And the Act  defines “t rade secret” to mean “information” that derives \neconomic value from being kept secret and that is subject to reasonable efforts to keep it secret.  \nId. § 445.1902(d).  In the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, Pub. L. No. 114 -153, 130 Stat. 376, \nCongress also authorized trade -secret owners  to seek injunctions against  actual or threatened \nmisappropriation of trade secrets for products or services in interst ate commerce.  18 U.S.C. \n§ 1836 (b)(1), (3)(A) .  This federal law  define s “misappropriation” and “trade secret” in similar \nways.  Id. § 1839 (3), (5)(B)(ii)(III).  \nHere, t he district court viewed “the elements of misappropriation under” federal law as \n“substantially similar” to the elements of misappropriation under state law , so it “addresse[d] them \ntogether.”  RGIS , 2019 WL 3958392, at *5 n.3.  Likewise, the parties o n appeal treat the federal \nclaim as adopting legal standards that are coextensive with the standards that Michigan courts have \nadopted for the state claim .  For purposes of this appeal,  therefore,  we will follow the  parties’  lead \nand simply assume (without dec iding) that the federal law follows the same standards as the state  \nlaw.  Cf. Compulife Software Inc. v. Newman , __ F.3d __, 2020 WL 2549505, at *13 n.13 (11th \nCir. May 20, 2020).  \nRGIS showed  a likelihood of success that it could  satisfy both the “trade secret” and the \n“misappropriation” elements  of these claims.   Courts have found that these elements raise fact \nquestions reviewed  under the clear -error standard .  See, e.g. , Par Pharm., Inc. v.  QuVa Pharma, \nInc., 764 F.

Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 5No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n6 \n Gerdes does not appear to dispute the “trade secret” element .  Declarations from senior \nRGIS  officials  explained  that Gerdes knew much  of the company’s  confidential “ business \ninformation,” see 18 U.S.C. §  1839(3); Mich. Comp. Laws §  445.1902(d), including its “strategic \nfuture planning, [its] plans for future use of software and [artificial intelligence] , [its] customer \nservice levels, [its] recruitment strategy, [its] business development strategy, its regional pricing \nstrategy, and its margins.”  The declarations added that RGIS had taken reasonable measures to \nkeep this  business information secret ( such as  by requiring  its employees , including  Gerdes , to \nsign confidentiality agreement s) and that this information derived independent value from not \nbeing generally known.  See 18 U.S.C. §  1839(3); Mich. Comp. Laws §  445.1902(d).  With no \ncontrary evidence  from Ger des, t he district court did not  clearly  err in finding that th is information  \nlikely qualifies as a “trade secret” under the broad legal definitions  in federal and Michigan  law.  \nRGIS , 2019 WL 3958392, at * 6; see also, e.g. , Par Pharm. , 764 F.  App’x at 278–79. \nThe district court also did not  clearly err when it found  that RGIS had shown  that Gerdes \nlikely would “misappropriate ” RGIS’s trade secrets.  See Brake Parts , 443 F.  App’x at 30–31; Par \nPharm. , 764 F.  App’x at 279 .  Under Michiga n law—which , again,  we treat as coextensive with \nfederal  law for this case —a party seeking an injunction based on  a former employee’s  “threatened \nmisappropriation” of trade secrets “must establish more than the existence of generalized trade \nsecrets and a competitor’s employment of the party’s former employee who has knowledge of \ntrade secrets.”  Actuator Specialties, Inc. v. Chinavare , 2011 WL 6004068, at *3 (Mich. Ct. App. \nDec. 1, 2011) (per curiam) (quoting CMI Int’l, Inc. v. Intermet Int’l Corp. , 649 N.W.2d 808, 813 \n(Mich. Ct. App. 2002)  (per curiam) ).  Yet additional proof  that the former employee  showed  a \n“lack of trustworthiness b eyond his decision to work for a competitor ,” including  his deception of  \nthe former employer  about accepting a position with the competitor,  can support a conclusion  that       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 6No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n7 \n the employee cannot be “trusted” to keep trade secrets confidential.  Actuator Specia lties, 2011 \nWL 6004068, at *3 (quoting CMI Int’ l, 649 N.W.2d at 813; PepsiCo, Inc. v. Redmond , 54 F.3d \n1262, 1270 (7th Cir. 1995) ). \nHere, RGIS identified specific  pieces of business information that qualify as trade secrets, \nand presented enough evidence to support a finding that Gerdes showed  a “lack of trustworthiness \nbeyond” merely deciding to work for a competitor .  Actuator Specialties , 2011 WL 6004068, at \n*4.  To begin with, the district court could conclude that Gerdes was deceptive  about his reasons \nfor leaving RGIS .  According to a declaration from an RGIS official, Gerdes  told the company  that \nhe needed more “personal time and that he was not sure what he was going to do next .”  Yet he \nimmediately went to work for a  “direct competitor.”  In addition,  Gerdes allegedly failed to return \n“at least a Surface Pro laptop device that was provided to him by RGIS, ” as he was required to do \nby his employment agreement  after resigning his position .  And, as the district court also noted, \nGerdes did not present any arguments  to counter  these points.  RGIS , 2019 WL 3958392, at * 6.  \nThe district court  thus did not clearly err when finding that RGIS would likely be able to prove \nthat Gerdes would misappropriate RGIS’s trade secrets u nder federal and Michigan law.  \nLastly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the remaining \npreliminary -injunction factors weighed in favor of the injunction.  On irreparable harm, the district \ncourt noted that a harm may qualify a s irreparable —that is, “not fully compensable by money \ndamages ”—“if the nature of the plaintiff’s loss would make damages difficult to calculate. ”  RGIS , \n2019 WL 3958392, at *7  (citing Basicomputer Corp. v. Scott , 973 F.2d 507, 511 (6th Cir. 1991)).  \nMost relevant to this p art of the injunction, the court found that any disclosure of RGIS’s trade \nsecrets  would harm its “ability to compete with its competitors.”  Id.  We have previously  upheld \nsimilar  findings of i rreparable harm.  See, e .g., Brake Parts , 443 F.  App’x at 32; Basicomputer       Case: 19-2051     Document: 28-2     Filed: 06/12/2020     Page: 7No. 19-2051,  RGIS, LLC v. Keith Gerdes  \n8 \n Corp. , 973 F.2d at 512.   Gerdes also does not dispute  the district court’s findings about  the other \ntwo preliminary -injunction factors , so he has forfeited any challenge  to them .  See, e.g. , Indeck \nEnergy Servs., Inc. v. Consumers Energy Co. , 250 F.3d 972, 979 (6th Cir. 2000).  \nIn sum, t he district court did not abuse its discretion by granting a preliminary injunction  \non this record .  We affirm.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Fox v. Makin et al., the plaintiffs, Gregory Fox and Rita Fox, challenged a vaccination policy implemented by the Maine School Administrative District 51, alleging it violated constitutional rights. The court addressed several motions to seal sensitive documents, balancing public access with privacy, ultimately allowing for redactions and unsealing some deposition exhibits. Notably, the concern of artificial intelligence misuse was raised, highlighting worries about AI potentially manipulating or misusing sensitive deposition footage, though AI itself was not directly involved in the claims or holding.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The primary legal issue in this decision was how to balance the public's right of access to judicial records with the privacy interests of the involved parties, particularly when documents contain sensitive information about minors and private family details.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted, in part, the motions to seal certain documents and required the unsealing of others with redactions. While upholding the need for transparency in judicial records, especially in public interest cases, the court permitted some privacy protection for the plaintiff's deposition transcripts and other sensitive documents.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine your parents are in a court case because they disagree with the school's vaccination rules. They want to keep some personal information about your family and personal life private, even though they have to share it in court. The judge decided which pieces of this information could stay secret and which needed to be shared with the public. Though they tried to keep some things private, the judge emphasized that the public generally has the right to see what's happening in court, especially in cases that people care a lot about. They also worried about people using computer programs to mess with the information if it was shared too widely.",

BACKGROUND  \nOn July 22, 2022, Dr. Gregory Fox, individually and as parent of C.F.,1 and \nRita Fox, individually and as parent of C.F. (jointly, the Plaintiffs), filed a lawsuit in \nthe Cumberland County Superior Court for the state of Maine against the state of \nMaine, the Maine Department of Education, Maine School Administrative District 51 \n(MSAD 51), and various state and local officials (collectively, the Defendants), \nalleging the Defendants violated the United States Constitution in promulgating and  \nimplementing a vaccination policy at MSAD 51.  Notice of Removal , Attach. 1, Compl. \n(ECF No. 1).  The Defendants initially identified themselves as forming two groups: \n \n1  The Court refers to Dr. Fox’s minor son by his initials, C.F., in accordance with the Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 5.2.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 5.2(a)(3).   Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 1 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n the State Defendants (the state of Maine, the Maine Department of Education, and \nMaine Department of Education Commissioner Pender Makin) and the School \nDefendants (MSAD 51, MSAD 51 Superintendent Jeffrey Porter, Mabel I. Wilson \nElementary School Principal  Sally Loughlin, and Mabel I. Wilson Elementary School \nVice Principal Corey Munsey).  Id . at 1, 3.  On August 17, 2022, the case was removed \nto this Court.  Id . at 1-3.    \nWith the Court’s permission, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on \nDecember 14, 2022, that did not name either the state of Maine or the Maine \nDepartment of Education as defendants and thus left Commissioner Makin and the \nSchool Defendants as the on ly defendants.  Pls.’ Mot. to Am. Compl. (ECF No. 32); \nOrder (ECF No. 41); Pls.’ Am. Compl. (ECF No. 45).   \nNext, on August 16, 2023, ruling on motions to dismiss from Commissioner \nMakin and the School Defendants, respectively, the Court dismissed all claims \nagainst MSAD 51 and Principal Loughlin, who had retired, and further dismissed all \nclaims for money damages against Commissio ner Makin, Superintendent Porter, and \nMr. Munsey.2   Order on Defs.’ Mots. to Dismiss (ECF No. 81).  After the Court’s order, \nthe only surviving claims were against Commissioner Makin and the School \nDefendants (Superintendent Jeffrey Porter and Principal Corey Munsey) in their \nofficial capacities for declaratory and injunctive relief.3  Id.  On February 12, 2025, \n \n2  After Principal Loughlin retired, Mr. Munsey was promoted to principal of Mabel I. Wilson \nElementary School.  Order on Defs.’ Mots. to Dismiss at 5, n.7.   \n3  On November 20, 2023, the Plaintiffs moved to amend the amended complaint, seeking to \nmodify their prayer for relief based on C.F. aging out of Mabel I. Wilson Elementary School and to add \na claim for equitable reimbursement of the expenses paid to educate  C.F.  Pls.’ Second Mot. to Am. \nCompl. (ECF No. 90).  On February 22, 2024, a United States Magistrate Judge issued an order and Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 2 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal, dismissing all claims brought by Rita Fox, \non her own behalf or on behalf of C.F., with prejudice and without fees or costs to any \nparty, Stip. of Dismissal (ECF No. 203), leaving Dr. Fox, individually and as parent \nof C.F., the sole plaintiff.     \n On June 6, 2025, following a period of discovery and motion practice,  \nCommissioner Makin, the School Defendants, and Dr. Fox each filed respective \nmotions for summary judgment.  Comm’r Makin’s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF No. 214); \nSchool Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF No. 215); Pl.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (ECF No. 216).  \nIn support of their respective motions, the Defendants  filed a joint statement of \nmaterial facts.  Defs.’ Joint Supporting Statement of Material Facts (ECF No. 212).  \nBecause of the purported sensit ive nature of some supporting documents in the \nDefendants’ Joint Statement of Material of Facts, they also filed a joint motion to seal, wholly and indefinitely, those documents.  Defs.’ Joint Mot. to Seal . (ECF No. \n213) ( Defs.’ Joint Mot. ).   \nOn August 23, 2025, Dr. Fox filed oppositions to Commissioner Makin’s and \nthe School Defendants’ summary judgment motions.  Pl. Dr. Fox’s Opp’n to Comm., Makin’s Mot. for Summ. J.  (ECF No. 228); Pl. Dr. Fox’s Opp’n to School Defs.’ Mot. \n \nrecommended decision on the second motion to amend complaint, recommending the Court grant the \nmotion to amend the complaint insofar as it requests placement in the relevant school for the age of the Plaintiffs’ child at the time of the judgment but deny t he motion insofar as it requests equitable \nreimbursement .  Order and Recommended Decision on Mot. to Am. Compl. at 13 (ECF No. 96).  On \nJuly 11, 2024, over the objection of Dr. Fox, the Court affirmed the Magistrate Judge’s recommended decision.  Order on Obj. to Recommended Decision (ECF No. 118).  Ms. Fox filed her second amended complaint on July 14, 2024, and Dr. Fox filed his second amended complaint on August 1, 2024, each of which incorporated the contents of the first amended complaint with revisions to the prayers for relief.  Pl. Rita Fox’s Second Am. Compl. (ECF No. 119); Pl. Gregory Fox’s Second Am. Compl. (ECF \nNo. 127).

A few days later, on August 25, Dr. Fox moved to seal \ncertain deposition transcripts cited in his recently filed oppositions.  Pl. Dr. Fox’s \nMotion to Seal  (ECF No. 231) (Dr. Fox’s Mot. ).  Similar to the Defendants’ Joint \nMotion to Seal, Dr. Fox requested sealing certain deposition transcripts on the \ngrounds they “contain[] confidential or sensitive information.”  Id . at 1.   \nOn August 27, 2025, the Court issued an order requiring the parties to respond \nto its concerns about the overbreadth of their motions to seal.  Order to Resp. (ECF \nNo. 235).  On September 8, 2025, Commissioner Makin responded to the order to \nrespond.  Comm’r Makin’s Resp. to Ct.’s Order to Resp. (ECF No. 237) ( Makin Resp. ).  \nOn September 9, 2025, the School Defendants filed their response to the order to \nrespond.  Sch. Defs.’ Resp. to Ct.’s Order to Resp. (ECF No. 241) ( Sch. Defs.’ Resp. ).  \nOn September 11, 2025, Dr. Fox filed his response.  Pl.’s Mem. Responding in Support of Redaction and Sealing of Dep. Trs. (ECF 235) (ECF No. 247) (Dr. Fox Resp. ).  \nII. THE PARTIES’ RESPONSES\n \nA.  Commissioner Makin’s Response  \nIn the Commissioner’s response, she conceded that she took a “conservative \napproach” in moving t o seal the summary judgment record.  Makin Resp. at 1.   Upon \nreview of the Court order, the Commissioner agreed that the exhibits to Jessica \nShiminski ’s declaration could be unsealed.  Id.  The Commissioner took no position \nregarding the School Defendants’ response and wrote that she would not object to the redaction of the deposition transcripts of Gregory and Rita Fox  in accordance with Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 4 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2 and the consent -to confidentiality order .  Id. at 1-\n2; Consent -to Confidentiality Order (ECF No. 87) .   \nB.  The School Defendants’ Response  \nIn the School Defendants’ response, they addressed each filing separately.  Sch. \nDefs.’ Resp. at 1-4.  First, they agreed that exhibits to Superintendent Porter’s \ndeposition could be unsealed and made public since C.F.’s full name and date of birth \nwould be redacted.  Id. at 2-3.  Next, they took no position on the sealing of the \nShiminski exhibits.  Id. at 1.  They also agreed with Commissioner Makin and did \nnot object to redacting the Fox deposition transcripts in accordance with Rule 5.2 and \nthe confidentiality order.  Id. at 1 -2.  Regarding the deposition transcripts of \nSuperintendent Porter and Principal Munsey , the School Defendants proposed \nredactions as opposed to wholesale sealing.  Id. at 3-4.   \nC.  Dr. Fox’s Response  \nFirst, Dr. Fox observes that the deposition transcripts of both his wife and \nhimself contain “extensive medical information regarding minor children, as well as \nprivate details about family affairs, religious beliefs, and personal history.”  Dr. Fox \nResp. at 2.  Dr. Fox seeks “targeted redaction and, where necessary, sealing of clusters \nof medical information.”  Id.  In addition to the privacy concerns about publi shing  \nhealth, vaccination status, and medical care of minor children, Dr. Fox points to \n“docume nted harassment, social isolation, and exclusion directed at Plaintiff’s \nchildren and family.”  Id.  Also, Dr. Fox says his proposed redactions protect “only Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 5 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n non-public, non -essential information.”  Id.  Dr. Fox points out that the Court will \nhave access to all information for its analysis and decision -making.  Id.   \nDr. Fox notes that pursuant to a court order, the videotape of Dr. Blaisdell’s \ndeposition was sealed to  minimize the risk of harassment and the potential for \ntechnological misuse.  Id. at 3.  Dr. Fox worries that the availability of a transcript \nwill create “a real risk of misuse, including selective editing, out -of-context \npublication, and manipulation by artificial intelligence.”  Id.  Dr. Fox urges the Court \nto “apply the same protective rationale as in the Blaisdell order, and permit targeted \nredaction and partial sealing of clusters of medical information in the Fox deposition.”  \nId. at 4.  Dr. Fox observes that the issues in this case – involving state government \nauthority, individual medical autonomy, and religious liberty – “are inherently \npolarizing and likely to provoke strong responses from activists and the public.”  Id. \nat 5.  Dr. Fox reviews the extensive coverage of this controversy by the Bangor Daily \nNews.  Id. at 6-7; id., Attach. 1 at 2- 3. \nIII. DISCUSSION  \n In their motions to seal, the parties requested that the Court seal the following:  \n(1) The exhibi ts to the Declaration of Jeffrey Porter;  \n(2) The exhibits to the Declaration of Jessica Shiminski;  \n(3) The deposition transcripts of Corey Munsey and Jeffrey Porter; and  \n(4) The deposition transcripts of Dr. and Ms. Fox;  \nFirst, the Court agrees that the exhibits to the declarations of Jeffrey Porter and \nJessica Shiminski may be unsealed since the se documents as resubmitted contain Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 6 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n redactions of C.F.’s full name and date of birth.  Second, t he Court agrees with the  \nSchool Defendants ’ proposed redactions of the deposition transcripts of Corey Munsey \nand Jeffrey Porter.   \n Third, although the Court respects Dr. Fox’s efforts to maintain his and his \nfamily’s privacy, he has elected to file a lawsuit in federal court, where there is a right \nof public access to judicial records, and his proposed redactions to his wife’s and his \ndepositions are too extensive to comply with the First Circuit’s teaching in United \nStates v. Kravetz , 706 F.3d 47 (1st Cir. 2013) , that mandates a presumption of public \naccess to judicial records .  Compare Additional Attachs. Attach. 1, Dr. Fox Redacted \nDep. Tr. (ECF No. 248) (Dr. Fox Redacted Tr. ), with Pl. Gregory Fox’s Mot. to Seal , \nAttach. 1 , Dr. Fox Sealed and Unredacted Dep. Tr. (ECF No. 231) (Dr. Fox Unredacted \nDep. Tr. ).  For example, in his redacted version, Dr. Fox redacts the list of exhibits to \nhis deposition. See Dr. Fox Redacted Dep. Tr. at 3.  The Court does not know why \nmerely a list of exhibits implicates any privacy concerns.  Dr. Fox also redacts \nreferences to his post -secondary education.  See Dr. Fox Redacted Tr. at 13 :10-16:20.  \nAgain, especially as Dr. Fox is being referred to by his professional title in this litigation, the Court does not understand why his education, which is generally a \nmatter of public record, should be redacted from the docketed transcript.  The Court \ncould go on .   \nIn brief, the Court  concludes that Dr. Fox has been much too aggressive in \nprotecting his and his family’s privacy in his proposed redactions to comply with the \nright of public access described in Kravetz.  Even so , the Court will allow Dr. Fox’s Case 2:22-cv-00251-JAW     Document 252     Filed 10/16/25     Page 7 of 9    PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n redactions to stand for the moment.  The parties filed the complete transcripts of each \nwitness at the Court’s request.  The Court has discovered that when the parties file \nsnippets of deposition transcripts in support of their statements of material fact,  it is \noften difficult to understand the full context by the abridged versions alone.  Thus,  \nthe entire  transcript is not being submitted as a judicial record, and therefore falls \non the edge of Kravetz .  Instead, as the Court works through the facts submi tted by \nthe parties in support of the dispositive motions, if it is necessary to cite a portion of \nDr. Fox’s redactions, the Court will order that portion unredacted.   \n As a final caution , if this case goes to trial, the Court will enforce rigorously \nthe right of public access, particularly as this case involves matters of public concern.  This does not mean that evidence revealing the name and other details of the minor \nwill be made publi c, but it does mean that the parties, including Dr. Fox, should \nanticipate that broad redactions similar to those contained in Dr. Fox’s submissions \nwill not remain confidential in a public trial.   \nIV. CONCLUSION\n \n The Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Def endants’  Joint Mot ion to \nSeal.  (ECF No. 213).  The Court UNSEALS the deposition exhibits to the Declarations \nof Jeffrey Porter and Jessica Shiminski and UNSEALS as redacted the deposition transcripts of Corey Munsey and Jeffrey Porter.  \nThe Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiff Dr. Fox’s Motion to \nSeal (ECF No. 231).  The Court UNSEALS as redacted the deposition transcripts of \nDr. Gregory Fox and Rita Fox.

Th e Court provisionally \ngrants Plaintiff leave to proceed in forma pauperis.  Plaintiff must still supply the missing financial \ninformation by the deadline in the NOD.  Plaintiff’s Complaint is largely incomprehe nsible and appears to bring claims against \nvarious social media companies.  Plaintiff seems to allege that he  was exposed to “illegal A.I.” \nemissions when he started hearing voices in 2019.  (Doc. 1, at 2.)  He sugges ts that  social media \nplatforms used “human induced psychosis in 2021 that cause thought of  suicide in 2021.”  Id.  \nPlaintiff claims that “emitter technology can be  linked to human freque ncy that cause human Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 5   Filed 04/25/24   Page 1 of 82 \n induced psychosis a wifi techno logy little black box t echnology ultra sound beam air technology \nthat has side effect of thought of suicide self harm if not suic ide the illegal A.I. can lead to human \ndeath.”  Id. at 4.  Plaintiff alleges that  this has led to stalking and bullying through the company \nwifi and frequency targeting with illegal A.I.  Id. at 5. \n Plaintiff names as defendants:  Facebook; Me ta; Instagram; Twitter; Mark Zuckerberg; and \nMichael Zuckerberg.  For relief, Plaintiff seeks:  compensation; an apology;  to have the FBI stop \nsocial media from using illegal artificial intelligence;  to be taken out of the Kansas Department of \nCorrections’ “wifi and frequency and so cial media wifi and frequency.”  Id. at 6.   \nII.  Statutory Screening of Prisoner Complaints    The Court is required to screen complaints brought by prisoners seek ing relief against a \ngovernmental entity or an officer or an employee  of a governmental entity. 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a).  \nThe Court must dismiss a complaint or portion ther eof if a plaintiff has raised claims that are \nlegally frivolous or malicious, that fail to state a claim upon which relief ma y be granted, or that \nseek monetary relief from a defe ndant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1)–\n(2).    “To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the vi olation of a right secured by \nthe Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was \ncommitted by a person  acting under color of state law.”  West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48 \n(1988)(citations omitted); Northington v. Jackson , 973 F.2d 1518, 1523 (10th Cir. 1992).  A court \nliberally construes a pro se complaint and applies “less stringent standards than formal pleadings \ndrafted by lawyers.”  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007).  In addition, the court accepts \nall well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true.  Anderson v. Blake , 469 F.3d 910, 913 (10th \nCir. 2006).  On the other hand, “when the allegations  in a complaint, howeve r true, could not raise Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 5   Filed 04/25/24   Page 2 of 83 \n a claim of entitlement to relief,” dismissal is appropriate.  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 \nU.S. 544, 558 (2007).   \nA pro se litigant’s “conclusory allegations  without supporting fa ctual averments are \ninsufficient to state a claim upon which relief can be based.”  Hall v. Bellmon , 935 F.2d 1106, \n1110 (10th Cir. 1991).  “[A] plaintiff’s obligatio n to provide the ‘grounds’ of  his ‘entitle[ment] to \nrelief’ requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a \ncause of action.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (citations omitte d).  The compla int’s “factual \nallegations must be enough to ra ise a right to relief above the sp eculative level” and “to state a \nclaim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Id. at 555, 570.   \nThe Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals has explained “that, to state a claim in federal court, a \ncomplaint must explain what each defendant did to [the pro se plaintiff]; when the defendant did \nit; how the defendant’s action harmed  [the plaintiff]; and, what specific legal right the plaintiff \nbelieves the defendant violated.”  Nasious v. Two Unknown B.I.C.E. Agents , 492 F.3d 1158, 1163 \n(10th Cir. 2007).  The court “will not  supply additional factual allega tions to round out a plaintiff’s \ncomplaint or construct a legal theory on a plaintiff’s behalf.”  Whitney v. New Mexico , 113 F.3d \n1170, 1173-74 (10th Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). \nThe Tenth Circuit has pointed out that  the Supreme Court’s decisions in Twombly  and \nErickson  gave rise to a new standard of revi ew for § 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) dismissals.  See Kay v. \nBemis , 500 F.3d 1214, 1218 (10th Cir. 2007)(citations omitted); see also  Smith v. United States , \n561 F.3d 1090, 1098 (10th Cir. 2009).  As a result, courts “look to th e specific allegations in the \ncomplaint to determin e whether they plausibly support a legal claim fo r relief.”  Kay, 500 F.3d at \n1218 (citation omitted).  Under this new standard, “a plaintiff must ‘nudge his claims across the \nline from conceivable to plausible.’”  Smith , 561 F.3d at 1098 (citation omitted).  “Plausible” in Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 5   Filed 04/25/24   Page 3 of 84 \n this context does not mean “likely to be true,” but rather refers “to the scope of the allegations in \na complaint: if they are so ge neral that they encompass a wide  swath of conduct, much of it \ninnocent,” then the plaintiff has not “nudged [his ] claims across the line  from conceivable to \nplausible.”  Robbins v. Oklahoma , 519 F.3d 1242, 1247 (10th Cir. 2008) (citing Twombly , 127 S. \nCt. at 1974).   III.  DISCUSSION  Plaintiff states that he is bringing his cl aims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  “To state a claim \nunder § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws \nof the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting \nunder color of state law.”  West v. Atkins , 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) (citatio ns omitted).  A defendant \nacts “under color of state law” when he “exercise [s] power ‘possessed by vi rtue of state law and \nmade possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law.’”  Id. at 49 \n(citations omitted).   \n Plaintiff fails to plausibly claim that any of the Defendants are state actors.  See Bethune v. \nFacebook Inc. , 2021 WL 5182246, at *2 (D. Minn. Oct. 15, 2021) (“Neither Facebook nor \nZuckerberg is alleged, or can pl ausibly be alleged, to be a ‘sta te actor’ within the meaning of \n§ 1983.”) (citing see Prager Univ. v. Google LLC , 951 F.3d 991, 997 n.3 (9th Ci r. 2020) (c ollecting \ncases for proposition that private social-media companies such as and including Facebook are not \nstate actors for purposes of § 1983).   “Federal courts have uniformly rejected attemp ts to treat  . . .  social media companies as \nstate actors under Section 1983.”  Rutenburg v. Twitter, Inc. , 2021 WL 1338958, at *2 (N.D.

Supp. 436, 442 (E.D. Pa. 1996) \n(concluding that AOL “does not stan d in the shoes of the State”)); see also Medina v. Facebook, \nMeta Platforms, Inc. , 2023 WL 8234586, at *2 (M .D. Fla. Nov. 28, 2023) (fi nding that plaintiff \nfailed to allege a st ate actor when suing th e owner of Facebook and Facebook, a publicly traded \ncompany).  Furthermore, “a social  media company[] does not become a state ac tor based solely on \nthe availability of its social me dia network to the public. . ..”  McWaters v. Houston , 2022 WL \n395309, at *11 (M.D. Ala. Feb. 8, 2022) (citations omitted).  Not only has Plaintiff failed to na me a state actor, but his claims also appear to be frivolous.  \n“A complaint . . . is frivolous when it ‘lacks an  arguable basis either in  law or in fact.’”  Manco v. Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 5   Filed 04/25/24   Page 5 of 86 \n Does , 363 F. App’x 572, 575 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 325 \n(1989)).  The Tenth Circuit in Manco held that: \nThe district court also did not ab use its discretion when it held \nManco’s claims related to the alleged tracking device were \nfrivolous. Manco’s theory that nume rous state officials monitor his \nthoughts and send him inaudible, prof ane messages is not supported \nby any evidence. Manco provides c itations to various patents and \nsecondary literature that describe tracking devices. Even if, for the \nsake of argument, this court assumes that such  devices exist, Manco \nfails to provide evidence that officials implanted a device in his body, nor does he give a plausible motive for stat e officials to \nembark on such an endeavor. We agree with the district court that Manco’s tracking device cl aims are frivolous. See Denton v. \nHernandez,  504 U.S. 25, 33, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 \n(1992) (describing frivolous claims as “fanciful,” “fantastic,” and \n“delusional,” and holding “a findi ng of factual frivolousness is \nappropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them”). \n  \n Id.   \n Plaintiff should show good cause why his Comp laint should not be dismissed as frivolous \nand for failure to name a state actor. \nIV.  Motion for Appointment of Counsel  \n Plaintiff has filed a motion for appointmen t of counsel, arguing that he has no family \nsupport, no job, and no access to information on lawyers or thei r phone numbers.  (Doc. 3, at 3–\n4.)     \nThe Court has considered Plai ntiff’s motion for appointment of counsel.  There is no \nconstitutional right to  appointment of counsel  in a civil case.  Durre v. Dempsey , 869 F.2d 543, \n547 (10th Cir. 1989); Carper v. DeLand , 54 F.3d 613, 616 (10th Cir. 1995).  The decision whether \nto appoint counsel in a civi l matter lies in the discreti on of the district court.  Williams v. Meese , \n926 F.2d 994, 996 (10th Cir. 1991).  “The burden is on the applicant to c onvince the court that Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 5   Filed 04/25/24   Page 6 of 87 \n there is sufficient merit to  his claim to warrant the appointment of counsel.”  Steffey v. Orman , 461 \nF.3d 1218, 1223 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting Hill v. SmithKline Beecham Corp. , 393 F.3d 1111, 1115 \n(10th Cir. 2004)).  It is not enough “that havi ng counsel appointed would have assisted [the \nprisoner] in presenting his strongest  possible case, [as] the same c ould be said in any case.”  Steffey , \n461 F.3d at 1223 (quoting Rucks v. Boergermann , 57 F.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir. 1995)).   \nIn deciding whether to appoint counsel, courts must evaluate “the merits of a prisoner’s \nclaims, the nature and complexity of the factual and legal issues, and the prisoner’s ability to \ninvestigate the facts and present his claims.”  Hill, 393 F.3d at 1115 (citing Rucks , 57 F.3d at 979).  \nThe Court concludes in this case that  (1) it is not clear at this junctu re that Plaintiff has asserted a \ncolorable claim against a named defendant; (2) the i ssues are not complex; and (3) Plaintiff appears \ncapable of adequately presenting facts and argumen ts.  The Court has found that the Complaint is \nsubject to dismissal as frivolous and for failure to  name a state actor.  The Court therefore denies \nthe motion for appointment of counsel.   \nV.  Response Required \nPlaintiff is required to show  good cause why his Complaint sh ould not be dismissed for the \nreasons stated herein.  Failure to respond by the deadline may result in dism issal of this action \nwithout further notice for fail ure to state a claim.   \n IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  THAT  Plaintiff’s motion for leave to proceed in forma \npauperis (Doc. 2) is provisionally granted .

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   Shira Perlmutter, the former Register of Copyrights of the U.S. Copyright Office, sought a preliminary injunction following what she argued was her unlawful removal by President Trump. The court denied her request, ruling that Perlmutter did not demonstrate she would suffer irreparable harm from the removal. Notably, while the case involves an ongoing report on copyright and artificial intelligence, the applicability of AI in the decision is limited to the procedural context and does not directly influence the court's ruling.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether Shira Perlmutter’s removal from her position as Register of Copyrights constitutes irreparable harm that warrants a preliminary injunction.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that Perlmutter did not sufficiently demonstrate irreparable harm resulting from her temporary removal, failing to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction in government personnel matters.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you were suddenly told you couldn't be the class president anymore, and someone else took over. You go to the teacher (the court) and say, \"Hey, it's not fair! I should still be president because I was never properly removed.\" You argue that not being the class president right now is causing you big, un-fixable problems. The teacher looks at your request and decides, \"Sorry, but I don't see that you're experiencing the kind of serious issues that can't be undone later if we find out you were right.\" In this case, the teacher (the judge) is saying, \"Being temporarily out of your position isn't the kind of harm that makes me step in with an urgent fix.\"",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  \n  \nCivil Action No.  25-1659  (TJK)  SHIRA PERLMUTTER , \nPlaintif f, \nv. \nTODD BLANCHE et al. , \nDefendant s. \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  \nOn May 10, 2025, Shira Perlmutter was purportedly fired by President Trump from her \nposition as Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office  at the Library of \nCongress.  A rguing that this attempt to terminate her was unlawful, she sued a few weeks later and \nthen moved for a preliminary injunction, seeking to prevent her removal .  The Court will deny her \nmotion because she has not shown that she will be irreparably harmed without this relief.  \nI. Background  \nA. Factual Background  \nOn May 8, 2025, President Trump removed Carla D. Hayden  as Librarian of Congress.  \nECF No. 24 -3 ¶ 5.  Two days later, acting through another official , he similarly purported to re-\nmove Perlmutter as head of the Copyright Office via an email that terminate d her “ effective im-\nmediately.”  Id. ¶ 9.  And the next day, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche —whom President \nTrump had “directed to perform the duties of the office of the Librarian of Congress” following \nthe former Librarian’s removal, ECF No. 24 -5 at 3 —“designate [d] Paul Perkins” to replace Perl-\nmutter “as the Acting Register of Copyrights and Acting Director of the U.S. Copyright Office,” \nid. at 2.  For her part, Perlmutter maintains that she “remain[ s] Register of Copyrights” and that Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 1 of 15 2 she has “not received any communication from Library of Congress leadership that purports to \nterminate [her] employment as Register of Copyrights.”  Id. ¶¶ 12–13. \nB. Procedural History  \nPerlmutter claims that “the purported appointments of ” Blanche and Perkins “ have caused \nconsiderable confusion among Library staff, copyright stakeholders, and the public” and will “im-\npede the Copyright Office’s ability to perform its work.”  ECF No. 24 -3 ¶¶ 11, 15.  So o n May 22, \n2025, she sued, bringing two counts challenging her purported removal and the President’s ap-\npointment of Blanche as the Acting Librarian of Congress.  ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 26–36.  She also moved \nfor a temporary restraining order .  ECF No.  2.  On May 28, t he Court denied  her motion , conclud-\ning that she had  not shown  that she would suffer irreparable harm  without that relief .  ECF No. 15  \nat 36 –52.  Then,  on June 10, Perlmutter moved for a preliminary injunction , ECF No. 24, and the \nCourt held a hearing on the motion on July 23.  \nII. Legal Standard  \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction \nmust establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his f avor, and that an in-\njunction is in the public interest.”  Id. at 20.  “[P]laintiffs bear the burden of persuasion on all four \npreliminar y injunction factors.”  Open Top Sightseeing USA v. Mr. Sightseeing, LLC , 48 F. Supp. \n3d 87, 90 (D.D.C. 2014).   Thus, “failure to show a likelihood of irreparable harm” is, “standing \nalone, sufficient to defeat the motion.”  Brennan Ctr. for Just. at NYU Sch. of L. v. Dep ’t of Com. , \n498 F. Supp. 3d 87, 96 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Navajo Nation v. Azar , 292 F. Supp. 3d 508, 512 \n(D.D.C. 2018)).  \nThe D.C. Circuit “ has set a high standard for irreparable injury. ”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 2 of 15 3 Churches v. England , 454 F.3d 290 , 297  (D.C. Cir. 2006) .  “[T] he injury must be both certain and \ngreat; it must be actual and not theoretical. ”  Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC , 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. \n1985)  (per curiam).  “T he party seeking injunctive relief must show that the injury complained of \nis of such imminence  that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable \nharm.” Id. (cleaned up).  In other words, “[t] he movant must provide proof that the harm has oc-\ncurred in the past and is likely to occur again, or proof  indicating that the harm is certain to occur \nin the near future. ”  Id.  Furthermore, “ the movant must show that the alleged harm will directly \nresult  from the action which the movant seeks to enjoin. ”  Id. (emphasis added) .  Finally, the injury \nmust be truly “irreparable” —i.e., “beyond remediation.” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches , 454 \nF.3d at 297.  \nIII. Analysis  \nThe Court ’s analysis begins and ends with irreparable harm .  Perlmutter argues that her \nremoval from office —even if only temporary —is irreparable harm that can only be prevented by \na preliminary injunct ion.  T he Court is unconvinced , so it will deny her motion.  \nThe Supreme Court has instructed  that the loss of a job and the harms that go along with it \ngenerally “ will not support a finding of irreparable injury, however severely they may affect a \nparticular individual. ”  Sampson v. Murray , 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974) .  “That is particularly true \nin cases involving government employment. ”  English v. Trump , 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 334 (D.D.C. \n2018 ).  Indeed, the Sampson Court emphasized “ that the Government has traditionally been \ngranted the widest latitude in the ‘dispatch of its own internal affairs .’”  415 U.S.  at 83 (quoting \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, A.F.L.—C.I.O. v. McElroy , 367 U.S. 886, 896 \n(1961) ).  And it noted that, even outside the government context, courts of equity are “tradi-\ntional [ly] unwilling []” “to enforce contracts for personal service either at the behest of the em-\nployer or of the employee .”  Id.  The Court also relied on “the historical denial of all equitable Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 3 of 15 4 relief by the federal courts ” when  a plaintiff sought, “by injunction, [to] restrain an executive of-\nficer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate appointee.”  Id. at 71, 83 (quoting White \nv. Berry , 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) ).  For these reasons,  preliminary equitable intervention in gov-\nernment -personnel cases is disfavored, and the plaintiff must at least demonstrate that her case \ninvolves a  “genuinely extraordinary situation ” to obtain  interim relief.   Id. at 92  n.68.  Such a \nshowing must establish that  “the circumstances surroundin g [her] discharge, together with the re-\nsultant effect on [her], . . . so far depart from the normal situation that irreparable injury might be \nfound. ”  Id.  Only then will she have shown “ irreparable injury sufficient in kind and degree to \noverride these factors cutting against the general availability of preliminary injunctions in Gov-\nernment personnel cases. ”  Id. at 84.1 \nPerlmutter argues that this case presents a “genuinely extraordinary situation” for three \nreasons:  (1) she has been deprived of her “‘statutory right to function ’ as Register of Copyrights,” \nECF No. 24 -2 at 34; (2) she “ remains Register of Copyrights and is therefore required to fulfill her \nstatutory duties ,” id. at 37; and (3) “[i]rreparable harm to the Library of Congress and Copyright \nOffice will frustrate [her]  ability to resume her duties,” id. at 39.   As explained below, each of \nthese arguments fail s. \nA. Perlmutter’s Temporary Loss of Her “Statutory  Right to Function”  While the \nCourt Resolves the Merits of Her Case  Is Not an Irreparable Harm  \nPerlmutter  first argues that this case warrants preliminary injunctive relief b ecause her \n \n1 At times , Perlmutter appears to suggest that the importance of her position  should play a \nrole in the Court’s analysis of whether this situation is  “genuinely extraordinary .”  E.g., ECF No. \n24-2 at 32.   Perhaps this is a response to  the Sampson  plaintiff ’s status as  a “probationary em-\nployee.”  415 U.S. at 62.   The reasoning in Sampson , though, did not appear to turn on the seniority \nof the employee .  Thus, the Court assigns little weight to this factor .  To be sure, such a consider-\nation is not irrelevant.  But it does little to show that “the circumstances surrounding [her]  dis-\ncharge, together with the resultant effect on [her],  . . . so far depart from the normal situation that \nirreparable injury might be found. ”  Sampson , 415 U.S. at 92 n.6 8. Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 4 of 15 5 removal  depriv es her  of her “statutory right to function” as the Register of Copyrights.  ECF No. \n24-2 at 32, 34 (quotation omitted).   Not so.   In the first case purport ing to recognize such a right , \nthe court found that the plaintiffs had shown irreparable harm because , without a preliminary in-\njunction , the court could not reinstate the m to their positions later on—because the positions would \nno longer exist.  See Berry v. Reagan , No. 83 -3182, 1983 WL 538  (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983) .  Noth-\ning similarly irremedi able is at stake here.  \nIn Berry , President Carter had appointed the plaintiffs, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, to the Commission on Civil Rights.   Id. at *1.   That body did not have a fixed term for \nmembers; by statute, it expired 60 days after the date established for submission of its final report, \nSeptember 30, 1983 .  Id. at *1  n.1.  The Commission ap parently did not meet  this deadline , leaving \nit racing to finish the report before it dissolved on November 29.   Id. at *5.  But President Reagan \nfired the plaintiffs before the Commission submitted its report, so they sued.  Id. at *1 .  After \nconcluding  that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits, the court found that they had \nestablished irreparable injury to “their statutory right to function as Commissioners .”  Id. at *5 .  \nAccording to that court, “[t]he irreparable nature of this injury is evident by the obviously disrup-\ntive effect the denial  of preliminary relief will likely have on the Commission ’s final activities .”  \nId.  Because the plaintiffs’ removal deprived the Commission of a quorum, it lost its “ ability to \nfulfill its mandate ” to issue a final report  before it expired .  Id.  These circumstances, the court  \nheld, satisfied the Sampson  test.  Id. \nEven putting aside that Berry  is not binding on this Court,  it does not provide Perlmutter a  \nwinning argument that she will likely suffer irreparable harm here for several reasons .  First, as \nnoted above, the harm to the plaintiff Commissioners was irreparable because , with out a prelimi-\nnary injunction, the Commission itself would have expir ed and the Court could not have reinstated Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 5 of 15 6 them to their positions .  Here, to the extent that Perlmutter argues that she suffers harm solely from \nnot functioning as the Register of Copyrights , she provides no reason to think that any such harm \ncannot be remediated in the ordinary course by returning her to her position if she prevails on the \nmerits.   She argues that later reinstatement is insufficient because she is being sidelined now and \ncan never  reclaim this lost time .  ECF No. 24 -2 at 34 –35.  And t o demonstrate, s he notes that the \nCopyright Office is in the middle of producing a multi -volume report on c opyright and artificial \nintelligence  for Congress and other stakeholders  and that her ability to “complete” that report “will \nbe forfeited during t he months -long pendency of this lawsuit.”   Id. at 35.  The Berry  court, how-\never, did not rely on this type of reasoning.  And more fundamentally,  this “lost time” argument \nproves too much because it would establish irreparable harm in every  wrongful -termination case . \nPerlmutter  also gestures at a related argument when she asserts that her removal and Per-\nkins’s appointment will have an irreparable effect on her because they will prevent her from “re-\nturn[ing] to her position as it currently exists.”  ECF No. 24 -2 at 39.  But she does n ot show  that \nDefendants’ actions, if not enjoined, will likely irreparably alter her position.  So those fears are \nvague and speculative, not “certain and great .”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches , 454 F.3d at \n297 (quotation omitted) . \nSecond, although the court  in Berry  appears to have assumed that alleged injury to the \nCommission was identical  to alleged injury to the plaintiff Commissioner s—an assumption with \nwhich the Court disagrees for reasons explained later —the situation  in Berry  was very different \nthan the one  here.  In Berry , denying  the requested injunction would have shut down the Commis-\nsion before  it fulfilled its mandate.   So the Commission  itself could not have continued to func-\ntion—and indeed, could never function again —absent preliminary relief .  Here, on the other hand,  \nwhile Perlmutter claims that Defendants’ actions “impede[]” her from carrying out the Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 6 of 15 7 responsibilities of the Copyright Office, ECF No. 24 -3 ¶ 14, she does not explain why the Copy-\nright Office cannot continue to operate under Perkins’s temporary leadership.  Cf. English , 279 F. \nSupp. 3d at 355 (finding that a  removed officer had not shown irreparable harm where the agency \nwould “not be shuttered” because it could “continue[] to operate” under the leadership of the of-\nficer’s purported replacement).   For example, though  Perlmutter  claims  that she will be temporar-\nily unable to complete the report on copyright and artificial intelligence absent an injunction, she \ndoes not explain why  the Copyright Office  could not do so without her at the helm.  See ECF No. \n24-3 ¶ 14(g).   So even if the Court could  consider some harms to the agency in considering irrep-\narable harm to Perlmutter, she has not shown that the type of harm the Berry  court addressed is \npresent here.  \nStill, moving past Berry  itself, Perlmutter identifies six more recent decisions from  this \ndistrict in which judges have conclud ed, at least in part based on Berry , that even the “temporary” \n“deprivation of a senior government official’s ‘statutory right to function’ .  . . is both significant \nand irreparable .”  ECF No. 24 -2 at 34; id. at 32 –33 (collecting  cases).   These cases get her no \nfurther . \nOne of them —Aviel v. Gor  (Aviel I ), No. 25 -cv-778, 2025 WL 1009035 (D.D.C. Apr. 4, \n2025) —is inapposite  for substantially the same reasons as Berry .  In that case, the district court \nfound irreparable harm because  “the very survival of [the removed officer’s]  organization [was] \nat stake.”  Id. at *10.  So  without an injunction , there would be no agency for the officer to return \nto after the case was resolved.   But to repeat, Perlmutter has not shown that the existence of the \nCopyright Office is at stake , or that her position will likely be irreparably changed without an \ninjunction .  In another —LeBlanc v. United States Privacy & Civil  Liberties Oversight Board —the \nagency, like the Commission i n Berry , would have been deprived of a quorum, preventing it from Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 7 of 15 8 carrying out many of its responsibilities.  No. 25 -cv-542, 2025 WL 1454010 , at *31  (D.D.C. May \n21, 2025) .  Yet again, Perlmutter has not shown  that the Copyright Office will grind to a halt \nwithout her.2  True, in the other four cases Perlmutter cites , judges found irreparable harm even \nthough  the plaintiff did not make a showing  similar to  Berry , Aviel I , or LeBlanc .  But r espectfully, \nfor that reason, the Court does not find their reasoning  persuasive .  See Brehm , 2025 U.S. Dist. \nLEXIS 71326 , at *7 –10 (declining to follow some cases cited  by Perlmutter since “the viability of \na ‘statutory right to function’ claim is uncertain” and, “[t]o the extent courts have accepted such a \nclaim, it has been on different facts”).  \nOn top of all that, what is striking about these four cases —and also about  LeBlanc —is \nwhat happened next:  either t he D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court stayed the injunctions entered \nby the district court s.  In three, either the Circuit or the Supreme Court stayed a preliminary in-\njunction directly.3  In the other two, the  decision cited by Perlmutter was an unappealable tempo-\nrary restraining order , but a subsequent permanent injunction entered by the same court was \nstayed .4  And while Perlmutter disputes the meaning of these developments  in the appellate courts , \n \n2 Similarly , in LeBlanc , the court  noted that the removed officer was “ appointed by the \nPresident, with the advice and consent of the Senate, to a nonpartisan, multimember board of ex-\nperts .”  2025 WL 1454010 , at *30.  Here, by contrast, Perlmutter was appointed by the Librarian, \nnot the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  17 U.S.C. §  701(a ).  At least one court \nin this district has held  that such a distinction minimizes the officer’s injury.  Brehm v. Marocco , \nNo. 25 -cv-660, 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71326 , at *8  (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025)  (finding no irreparable  \nharm from an officer’s removal  in part  because the officer “was not appointed by the U.S. President \nor confirmed by the Senate”).  \n3 LeBlanc v. U.S. Priv. & C.L. Oversight Bd. , No. 25 -cv-542, 2025 WL 1454010 (D.D.C. \nMay 21, 2025) , stayed , No. 25 -5197, 2025 WL 1840591 (D.C. Cir. July 1, 2025) (per curiam); \nGrundmann v. Trump , 770 F. Supp. 3d 166 (D.D.C. 2025) , stayed , No. 25 -5165, 2025 WL \n1840641 (D.C. Cir. July 3, 2025) (per curiam); Wilcox v. Trump , 775 F. Supp. 3d 215  (D.D.C.  \n2025) , stayed  sub nom.  Trump v. Wilcox , 145 S. Ct. 1415 (2025) . \n4 Harris v. Bessent , 775 F. Supp. 3d 164  (D.D.C. 2025) , stayed sub nom. Wilcox , 145 S. \nCt. 1415; Dellinger v. Bessent  (Dellinger I ), 768 F. Supp. 3d 33 (D.D.C. 2025) , stayed by Dellinger \n Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 8 of 15 9 this Court would have to blind itself to them to assign the weight to these cases that she urges .  In \nthe end, none of the injunctions stuck.   And no precedent of the Supreme Court or the D.C. Circuit \nhas recognize d that an official’s temporary loss of a “statutory right to function” is an irreparable \nharm in a situation like Perlmutter’s.  \nThe reasoning behind the orders staying the injunctions , even if not conclusive here, is \ninstructive as to whether Perlmutter is suffering the kind of harm warranting preliminary injunctive \nrelief,  especially in light of the balance of the equities .  For example, in considering the allegedly \nunlawful removal of members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Pro-\ntection Board, t he Supreme Court  held “that the Government faces greater risk of harm from an \norder allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully \nremoved o fficer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty. ”5  Trump v. Wilcox , 145 S. \nCt. 1415 , 1415  (2025) .  In other words, the Court concluded that an officer’s temporarily “ being \nunable to perform her statutory duty ” was not an irreparable harm —or at least, not a harm that \noutweigh ed the corresponding risk of harm to the Executive  such that an injunction was warranted .  \nId.  This makes sense in light of Sampson ’s holding that a plaintiff  “at the very least must make a \nshowing of irreparable injury sufficient in kind and degree to override the[]  factors cutting against \nthe general availability of preliminary injunctions in Government personnel cases. ”  415 U.S. at \n84.  And the D.C. Circuit has taken this approach as well .  In a recent case about  the alleged \nunlawful removal of the Special Counsel, it held  that “circumstances cut” against an injunction \n \nv. Bessent (Dellinger II ), No. 25 -5052, 2025 WL 887518 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 10, 2025) (per curiam) , \nvacated and remanded , No. 25 -5052, 2025 WL 935211 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 27, 2025) (per curiam).    \n5 As discussed later in this opinion, the D.C. Circuit has held that, as a matter of constitu-\ntional interpretation, the Library, at least in its role related to copyright matters, is part of the Ex-\necutive, not the Legislative, Branch.  Intercollegiate Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Copyright Royalty Bd. , \n684 F.3d 1332, 1342 (D.C. Cir. 2012) . Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 9 of 15 10 when, “[a]t worst,” the officer “would remain out of office for a short period of time” yet “the \npotential injury to the government of both having its designated [officer]  sidelined and unable to \nact while also having to try and unravel [the removed officer]’ s actions is substantial .”  Dellinger \nII, 2025 WL 887518 , at *4 . \nSo even assuming Perlmutter is right that her removal was unlawful, this reasoning sug-\ngests that  an injunction is not warranted  here.  “At worst, [she] would remain out of office for a \nshort period of time” while the Court resolves the merits.  Dellinger II , 2025 WL 887518 , at *4.   \nAnd as the Supreme Court suggested , even if Perlmutter has been “ wrongfully  removed,” tempo-\nrarily “being unable to perform her statutory duty,” without more, is not a harm that justifies a \npreliminary injunction , given the simila r balance of the equitie s here.  Wilcox , 145 S. Ct. at 1415; \ncf. Sampson , 415 U.S. at 84.  \nPerlmutter disputes the application of these appellate decisions and argues that they are \nlimited to circumstances where the Government is likely to succeed on the merits.6  Not so.  In \nWilcox , for example, the Supreme Court addressed the harm that “a wrongfully removed  officer \nfaces from being unable to perform her statutory duty. ”  145 S. Ct. at 1415  (emphasis added) .  \n \n6 Perlmutter also argues that Wilcox  is “non -precedential.”  ECF No. 34 at 26; see also \nAviel I , 2025 WL 1009035, at *10 (describing Dellinger II  as “non -precedential”).   In their oppo-\nsition , Defendants do not suggest otherwise.   Still, s ince briefing on Perlmutter’s motion and the \nhearing concluded , the Supreme Court  has clarified that its stay decisions, though “not conclusive \nas to the merits .  . . inform how a court should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases.” \nTrump v. Boyle , No. 25A11, 2025 WL 2056889 , slip op. at 1  (U.S. July 23, 2025) .  As noted above, \nthe Court’s decision here is informed by the reasoning in Wilcox .  And Boyle  itself only adds to \nthe pile  of similar authority.  In Boyle , the Court granted a stay pending appeal of a district court’s \npermanent injunction preventing the removal of members of the Consumer Product Safety Com-\nmission.  Id.  The Court explained that “[t]he application is squarely controlled by” Wilcox  and \nconcluded that a stay was warranted because, as there, “‘the Government faces greater risk of harm \nfrom an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrong-\nfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform  her statutory duty.’”   Id. (quoting Wilcox , \n145 S. Ct. at 1415).  Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 10 of 15 11 Although the Court also suggested that the Government was likely to prevail on one aspect of the \nmerits, n othing about its brief consideration of irreparable harm and the balance of the equities \nappeared to turn  on its assessment of the merits .  See id.   But even if it did, Dellinger II ’s discussion \ndid not.  There,  in a more developed analysis, the Circuit explicitly “assume[d]” that the officer’s \n“removal [was] statutorily ultra vires” and that such “removal constitute[d] a cognizable injury.”  \n2025 WL 887518 , at *4.  But it still determined that “that does not mean such injury is irreparable \nand weighs in [the officer’s] favor.”  Id.  Instead, when the injury is “remain[ing] out of office for \na short period of time,” “circumstances cut” against an injunction, even if the officer’s removal \n“deprive [s] [her] of the statutory right to function in office. ”  Id. (quotation omitted).7  So too here.  \nPerlmutter also argues that the D.C. Circuit’s handling of Aviel  “confirm[s]” that Wilcox  \ndoes not apply here because she—rather than Defendants —is likely to succeed on the merits.  ECF \nNo. 24 -2 at 35.   More than that, she appears to read  the Circuit to suggest tha t, as long as she shows \nsuch a likelihood, she is entitled to a preliminary injunction .  Id. at 36.   She points out that Judge \nKatsas, in a concurring statement joined by Judge Pillard, noted that the Supreme Court’s “merits \nruling” in Wilcox  “rested on the proposition that the removals at issue . . . were likely lawful ” and \nthat the Court did not disturb a prior D. C. Circuit decision suggesting that “reinstatement” is “an \nappropriate remedy” when an officer is unlawfully removed .  Aviel v. Gor  (Aviel II ), No. 25 -5105, \n2025 WL 1600446 , at *2 n.2  (D.C. Cir. June 5, 2025)  (Katsas, J., concurring) .   Based on these \nsnippets, Perlmutter seems  to argue  that, for purposes of preliminary relief , “reinstatement is an \nappropriate remedy if the removals at issued were likely unlawful ,” full stop —somehow skipping \nover (or implicitly satisfying ) her burden to show irreparable harm.  ECF No. 35 at 4.  \n \n7 Perlmutter suggests that Dellinger II  is limited to cases in which an appeal has been ex-\npedited.  ECF No. 24 -2 at 36.  But nothing in the opinion implies such a limitation.  Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 11 of 15 12 Perlmutter reads far to o much into Aviel II .  First, Judge Katsas’s point about the availabil-\nity of reinstatement as a remedy in officer -removal cases generally says nothing about Perlmutter’s  \nentitlement to that specific remedy now, other than  that it remains available if she satisfies the \nrequirements for a preliminary injunction.  Second,  nothing about Judge Katsas’s statement —\nwhich did not even address irreparable harm8—or Aviel II  purports to upend those requirements or \nthe longstanding precedent in this jurisdiction that “[a] movant’s failure to show any irreparable \nharm is .  . . grounds for refusing to issue a preliminary injunction, even if the other three factors \nentering the calculus merit such relief.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches , 454 F.3d at 297 .  \nThus, even assuming Perlmutter ’s removal was unlawful, she must still separately show such harm  \nto obtain a preliminary injunction .  In fact, not long before Aviel II , the Circuit reaffirmed this \ncommonsense conclusion in Dellinger II , when it assumed that the Special Counsel’s removal was \nunlawful but still found that he did not show  sufficient harm on a statutory -right -to-function theory  \nto warrant a preliminary injunction reinstat ing him .  2025 WL 887 518, at *4.  \nFor these reasons, the Court concludes that Perlmutter’s asserted loss of her “statutory right \nto function ” is not  a genuinely extraordinary situation such that her temporary removal is irrepa-\nrable harm —or at least, harm that outweighs any corresponding risk of harm to th e Government  \nsuch that the balance of the equities tips in her favor.  \nB. Perlmutter’s Temporary Inability to Perform Her Statutory Duties Is Not an \nIrreparable Harm  \nNext, Perlmutter argues that this case presents a genuinely extraordinary situation because \n \n8 Indeed, the only judge to discuss irreparable harm was Judge Rao, who explicitly rejected \nPerlmutter’s statutory -right -to-function theory of harm because, in her view, an officer “possesses \nno private right in the powers of her office or the policy direction of the agency.”   Aviel II  at *6 \n(Rao, J., dissenting) (citing Raines v. Byrd , 521 U.S. 811, 821 (1997) ). \n Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 12 of 15 13 she “remains Register of Copyrights and is therefore required to fulfill her statutory duties.”  ECF \nNo. 24 -2 at 37.  There is little if any difference between this theory of harm and her first.  Perlmut-\nter distinguishes the two by arguing that the first addresses her right  to function and the second \naddresses her obligation  to do so.  But at bottom, both are ways of claiming that she is suffering  \nirreparabl e harm because she cannot perform the job of Register of Copyrights  and Director of the \nCopyright Office .  And a s the Court has already explained, Perlmutter’s asserted inability to do \nthat job temporarily while this lawsuit proceeds is not enough to show  irreparable harm.  \nC. To Meet Her Burden of Showing Irreparable Harm, Perlmutter Cannot Rely \non Harms to the Library of Congress o r the Copyright Office  \nFinally, Perlmutter claims that her removal is genuinely extraordinary because Defendants’ \nactions inflict “institutional harm to the Library of Congress and U.S. Copyright Office.”  ECF \nNo. 24 -2 at 39.  But i njuries to third parties are not a basis to find irreparable harm.   Cardinal \nHealth, Inc. v. Holder , 846 F. Supp. 2d 203 , 213 (D.D.C. 2012) ; Winter , 555 U.S. at 20 (noting \nthat a party seeking preliminary injunctive relief must show “that he is likely to suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of preliminary relief ” (emphasis added)).  Indeed, in Sampson , the Court em-\nphasized that “irreparable injury” can be found only by considering “the  circumstances surround-\ning an employee’s  discharge, together with the resultant effect  on the employee .”  415 U.S. at 92 \nn.68 (emphasis added) .  So institutional harms to the Library or the Copyright Office, divorced \nfrom how those harms impact Perlmutter  personally , cannot help her meet her burden.  \nPerlmutter argues that institutional harms are relevant because, in cases like Wilcox , the \nSupreme Court considered harms to the office of the President, not just harms to President Trump \nindividually.  ECF No. 34 at 22.  But i n those  cases, the defendant officials were sued in their \nofficial capacities .  So when they moved to stay the injunctions issued by the lower courts, they \nhad the burden to show that they would be irreparably harmed in their official capacities  absent a Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 13 of 15 14 stay.  In such circumstances, it makes  sense to consider harm to their offices.  Here, on the other, \nPerlmutter  does not appear to dispute that she is suing in her personal capacity.  ECF No. 15 at \n48–49.  Thus, unlike a defendant sued in his official capacity, Perlmutter cannot rely on purported \ninstitutional harm s to the Library or Copyright Office  to show irreparable harm  to her . \nUndeterred , Perlmutter points to cases in which courts have considered harms to agencies \nin addressing whether a removed officer  has suffered irreparable harm.  See ECF No. 24 -2 at 39 –\n40.  But those cases do not stand for the general proposition that a removed officer can appropriate \nharm to an agency in asserting her own irreparable harm.  Instead, many  merely recognize , as \ndiscussed above, that an officer’s removal may threaten  irreparable harm to her when it is likely \nthe agency or office will no longer exist when the case is resolved .  See, e.g. , Aviel I , 2025 WL \n1009035 , at *10 –11; see also English , 279 F. Supp. 3d at 334–35 (discussing this theory of irrep-\narable harm ).  In those cases, courts concluded that s uch circumstances have an irreparable “re-\nsultant effect” on the removed officer because,  without an injunction , there will be no position for \nthe officer to return to should she win on the merits.  Sampson , U.S. at 92 n.68 ; Aviel I , 2025 WL \n1009035 , at *10 –11.  But as discussed , nothing in the record suggests that the existence of the \nCopyright Office  is threat ened  or that Perlmutter’s position will irreparably change in some way \nif it is temporarily held by Perkins .9 \nFinally, even putting aside  that these purported institutional  harms are not Perlmutter’s  to \ninvoke , they fail on their own terms.  She claim s that the Copyright Office will not be able to \n“perform its statutory role as a neutral advisor to Congress if an Executive Branch official controls \nthe Library of Congress’s operations.”  ECF No. 24 -2 at 40.   But this concern is  based on \n \n9 To the extent that some courts may have  permitted plaintiffs to establish irreparable harm \nby pointing to harms suffered solely by their agencies, the Court is not bound by those decisions \nand, for the reason explained above, respectfully disagrees with them.  Case 1:25-cv-01659-TJK     Document 40     Filed 07/30/25     Page 14 of 15 15 speculation  at this point , and no representative of Congress has sought to intervene in this case to \nprotect these interests that Perlmutter says are in peril.  Besides, for support, she mostly cites to \nprovisions of the U.S. Code governing the Congressional Research Service .  See ECF No. 24 -2 at \n40 (citing 2 U.S.C. §  166).   But that Service is “a separate department in the Library of Congress” \nuntethered to the Copyright Offi ce.  § 166(a).   Furthermore,  the D.C. Circuit has held that , as a \nmatter of consti tutional interpretation, the Library , at least in its role related to copyright matters, \nis part of the Executive , not the Legislative, Branch .  Intercollegiate Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Copyright \nRoyalty Bd. , 684 F.3d 1332 , 1342  (D.C. Cir. 2012).   And the Librarian —who appoints  the Register \nof Copyrights —is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and she \nis removable by the President at will.   Id. at 1341.   So Executive influence over the Copyright \nOffice appears to be a feature , not a bug , of this atypical arrangement.   See Kennedy v. Braidwood \nMgmt., Inc. , 145 S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Isaac Anthony Thomas v. Genesee County Sheriff's Department et al., the court addressed procedural missteps by the plaintiff, including improperly filed pleadings and a motion combining multiple requests. The case briefly involves artificial intelligence as the plaintiff noted that some of his legal filings were drafted with AI assistance. The court emphasized that the plaintiff is still accountable for any inaccuracies and compliance with legal rules, regardless of AI involvement.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff’s procedural filings, including motions and amendments, were in compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the local rules of the Eastern District of Michigan.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court struck down the plaintiff's improper filings and granted him leave to amend his complaint again, while warning about procedural compliance. Additionally, the court denied the plaintiff's request for court-appointed counsel and highlighted the improper use of motions and inaccuracies in the legal filings assisted by AI.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're playing a game, and there are strict rules on how to make a move. Isaac, playing this legal game, made some wrong moves by not following the rules, like trying to combine moves when that's not allowed and using a robot helper to prepare his moves without checking if they're correct. The court (the game's referee) told Isaac he has to redo those moves correctly but gave him another chance to play by the rules. The referee also reminded him that even with a robot helper, he's responsible for making sure the moves are right.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN  \nSOUTHERN DIVISION  \n \n \nISAAC ANTHONY THOMAS ,          \n                          \nPlaintiff,    Case No.  25- 10524 -SKD -APP  \nv. \nDistrict Judge  Susan K. DeClercq  \nMagistrate  Judge  Anthony P. Patti  \n \nGENESEE COUNTY SHERIFF'S  \nDEPARTMENT ET AL , \n Defendants.  \n       /       \n \nOMNIBUS ORDER ADDRESSING VARIOUS MOTIONS (ECF Nos. 4 \n& 5) , STRIKING PLAINTIFF’S REPLY TO DE FENDANTS ’ ANSWER \n(ECF No. 21) AND PLAINTIFF'S AMENDED COMPLAINT (ECF NO. 22) , \nAND GRANTING LEAVE TO FURTHER AMEND  \n \n Plaintiff Isaac Anthony Thomas, proceeding in forma pauperis, filed this \naction on February 24, 2025.  (ECF No. 1.)  Judge Susan K. DeClercq referred the \nmatter to me on April 4, 2025 “f or all pretrial proceedings, including a hearing and \ndetermination of all non−dispositive matters pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) \nand/or a report and recommendation on all dispositive  matters pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B).”  (ECF No. 17.)  After reviewing the docket, the Court now \nissues the following rulings to resolve all pending motions.  \nI. Reply to Answer (ECF No. 21)  \nPlaintiff has filed a “Reply to Answer to Complaint.” (ECF No. \n21.)  Plaintiff’s filing is imprope r under the Federal Rules of Civil Case 2:25-cv-10524-SKD-APP   ECF No. 23, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 04/15/25   Page 1 of 9 \n2 \n Procedure.   Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a)(7), a party may file a reply to an answer \nonly when the C ourt orders one.   The Court ordered no such pleading in this \ncase.   Nor did Plaintiff seek leave from the Court prior to filing.   Accordingly, \nPlaintiff’s unauthorized reply to Defendants’ answer (ECF No. 21) is STRICKEN . \nII. Notice of Incorporation (ECF No. 22)    \nAdditionally, Plaintiff has filed a “Notice of Incorporation by Reference of \nOriginal Complaint,” in which he “incorporates by reference his Original \nComplaint filed on February 24th 2025, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 10(c).”   (ECF No. 22, PageID.92.)  This is likewise improper, at least \nwith respect to amended pleadings, as Local Rule 15.1 states that, “Any \namendment to a pleading, whether filed as a matter of course or upon a motion to \namend, must, except by leave of court, reproduce the entire pleading as amended, \nand may not incorporate any prior pleading by reference.” E.D. Mich. LR 15.1.   As \nthe Court of Appeals has explained, “[g]enerally, amended pleadings supersede \noriginal pleadings.” Hayward v. Cleveland Clinic Found ., 759 F.3d 601, 617 (6th \nCir. 2014) (citing 6 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1476 (3d ed.2010)).  Thus, when a plaintiff “file[s] an amendment to \nhis original complaint after it has been served, any such amended c omplaint should \nbe drafted to replace the one originally filed[.]” Perry v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec ., No. \n17-12718, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 140287, *3 (E.D. Mich. Aug. 31, Case 2:25-cv-10524-SKD-APP   ECF No. 23, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 04/15/25   Page 2 of 9 \n3 \n 2017).   Accordingly, the operative pleading in this case is Plaintiff’s Amended \nComplaint (ECF No. 13) and ECF No. 22 is HEREBY STRICKEN .  Plaintiff is \ncautioned that all parties, including those proceeding without the assistance of \ncounsel, must comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Local \nRules of the Eastern District of Michigan.   However, having reviewed Plaintiff’s \noriginal and amended pleadings, and considering that service and/or appearances \nof all defendants is yet to be  completed,  the Court, sua sponte , HEREBY \nGRANTS Plaintiff leave to file a second amended complaint on or before May 5, \n2025 , to include  or combine whatever allegations he thought necessary to \nincorporate by reference into a single pleading, all to be contained within the four corners of a single document.  \nIII. Requests Regarding Counsel and Recording (ECF No. 4)  \nPlaintiff has also filed a motion “to allow Plaintiff to Submit Video \nEvidence to Court & to Appoint Counsel.” (ECF No. 4.)  Preliminarily, the Local \nRules prohibit the embedding of one motion within another, stating that, “ Motions \nmust not be combined with any other stand-alone document. ” E.D. Mich. LR \n5.1(e) and 7.1(i).  “For example, a motion for preliminary injunctive relief must not be combined with a complaint, a counter -motion must not be combined with a \nresponse or reply, and a motion for downward departure must not be combined with a sentencing memorandum. Papers filed in violation of this rule will be Case 2:25-cv-10524-SKD-APP   ECF No. 23, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 04/15/25   Page 3 of 9 \n4 \n stricken. ” E.D. Mich. LR 7.1(i).  Plaintiff’s motion, by combining two motions into \none, violates these local rules.  In the future, such combined motions will be \nstricken; however, here the Court chooses to use this as a teaching moment and to \ndecide both issues r aised in the motion on the merits.  \nA. Recording/Evidence  \nThe motion asks the Court to give Plaintiff “further direction on how to go \nforward” and asks how the Court “would like me to submit” “a recording that will \nbe used as evidence in my case. ” (Id., PageID.18.)  Fundamentally , the Court \ncannot give advice to parties.  As to the mechanics of filing certain items with the \nCourt, Plaintiff may contact the Clerk’s Office, which may be able to give him limited instructions, depending on the circumstances.  Moreover , the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan Local Rules state that a party “may not file discovery material \nspecified in Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(d)(1) . . . .”  E.D. Mich. LR 26.2.  Circumstances in \nwhich parties may file material (such as recordings) with the Court include “ when \nit provides factual support for a motion, response or reply .” Id., 26.2(1)  (emphasis \nadded) .  And in such circumstances, “ The party or other person relying on the \nmaterial must file only the germane portion of it as an exhibit or attachment to the motion, response, or reply. ” Id. Parties are not entitled to simply file items that \nthey perceive as being helpful to their case on the docket just to add them to the \nrecord . Case 2:25-cv-10524-SKD-APP   ECF No. 23, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 04/15/25   Page 4 of 9 \n5 \n B. Query regarding counsel    \nAs to appointment of counsel, Plaintiff’s motion contains more of a question \nthan an actual request, querying, “Also, does this court have the authority to \nappoint me counsel?” In short, the answer is “NO.” the Court does not have the \nauthority to appoint a private attorney for Plaintiff in this civil matter.  Proceedings \nin forma pauperis are governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1915, which provides that “[t]he \ncourt may request  an attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel.”  \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1) (emphasis added).  However, even if the circumstances of \nPlaintiff’s case convinced the Court to engage in such a search, “[t]here is no right \nto recruitment of counsel in federal civil litigation, but a distric t court has \ndiscretion to recruit counsel under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1).”  Dewitt v. Corizon, \nInc., 760 F.3d 654, 657 (7th Cir. 2014) (emphasis added); see also Olson v. \nMorgan , 750 F.3d 708, 712 (7th Cir. 2014) (“Congress hasn’t provided lawyers for \nindigent prisoners; instead it gave district courts discretion to ask lawyers to \nvolunteer their services in some cases.”).  The appointment of counsel in a civil case, therefore, “is a privilege and not a right.”  Childs v. Pellegrin , 822 F.2d 1382, \n1384 (6th C ir. 1987) (internal quotation and citation omitted).   \nThe Supreme Court has held that there is a presumption that “an indigent \nlitigant has a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived \nof his physical liberty.”  Lassiter v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. , 452 U.S. 18, 26 -27 Case 2:25-cv-10524-SKD-APP   ECF No. 23, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 04/15/25   Page 5 of 9 \n6 \n (1981).  With respect to pro se  civil rights cases in particular, the Court of Appeals \nfor the Sixth Circuit has held that “there is no right to counsel.  . . .  The \nappointment of counsel in a civil proceeding is justified only by exceptional \ncircumstances.”  Bennett v. Smith,  110 F. App’x 633, 635 (6th Cir. 2004) (internal \nand external citations omitted).1  Accordingly, although the Court has the statutory \nauthority to request counsel for pro se plaintiffs in civil cases under 28 U.S.C. § \n1915(e)(1), the exercise of this authority is limited to exceptional situations.  \nIn evaluating a matter for “exceptional circumstances,” a court should \nconsider: (1) the probable merit of the claims, (2) the nature of the case, (3) the \ncomplexity of the legal and factual issues raised, and (4) the ability of the litigant \nto represent h im or herself.  Lince v. Youngert , 136 F. App’x 779, 782 (6th Cir. \n2005); Lavado v. Keohane , 992 F.2d 601, 605 -06 (6th Cir. 1993); Lanier v. Bryant, \n332 F.3d 999, 1006 (6th Cir. 2003); Mars v. Hanberry , 752 F.2d 254, 256 (6th Cir. \n1985).  Plaintiff’s motion supplies no evidence of exceptional circumstances, and \nis more a request for information than an actual request for recruitment. Plaintiff’s \nmere reference to the fact that he is 22 years old (ECF No. 4, PageID.18) does not \nsuffice.  In any case, having considered the factors explained above, the motion is \n \n1 As noted above, although some of the case law colloquially discusses the Court’s \n“appointment” of counsel in prisoner civil rights cases, under 28 U.S.C. § \n1915(e)(1) the Court may only request that an attorney represent an indigent \nplaintiff.   Case 2:25-cv-10524-SKD-APP   ECF No. 23, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 04/15/25   Page 6 of 9 \n7 \n DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE .  Plaintiff may petition the Court for the \nrecruitment of pro bono counsel if this case survives all dispositive motion \npractice, proceeds to trial, or other exceptional circumstances demonstrate such a \nneed in the future.   It is notable, however, that his request for recruitment of \ncounsel is undercut by the next motion addressed in this order, which suggests that \nhe already has an attorney interested in representing him.       \nIV. Plaintiff’s Motion to Request Court -Appointed Counsel and \nSponsorship of Out -of-State Attorney (ECF No. 5)  \n \nFinally, Plaintiff asks the Court to “appoint counsel licensed in Michigan, not \nonly to represent Plaintiff but also to sponsor” the pro hac vice  admission of \nAttorney Steven A. Metcalf II of Metcalf & Metcalf, P.C., “a licensed attorney \nbased in New York City, to assist in this case[,]” noting that Mr. Metcalf “is \nadmitted in various federal jurisdiction s throughout New York, and in the District \nCourt for the District of Columbia.” (ECF No. 5, PageID.20-21.)  Plaintiff further \nstates that “as a prerequisite for Mr. Metcalf to be able to commit to represent me \nin this case   ̶  Mr. Metcalf requires sponsorship by an attorney licensed to practice \nin Michigan for pro hac vice admission pursuant to Local Rule 83.20(c)[.]” ( Id., \nPageID.21.)  However, a more careful reading of that Loca l Rule makes clear that \n“Pro hac vice admission is not permitted” in this District. (E.D. Mich. LR \n83.20(c)(1).  What is required  for an out of state attorney’s admission to practice in \nthis District, as well as local counsel requirements, is spelled  out in Local Rule Case 2:25-cv-10524-SKD-APP   ECF No. 23, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 04/15/25   Page 7 of 9 \n8 \n 83.20, and the Court need not provide a tutorial, especially to an attorney who is \nalready licensed in several federal districts.  It is unclear why the Court should be \ninvolved in recruiting local counsel to sponsor or otherwise support Mr. Metcalf, \nand most experienced attorneys can easily shift for themselves in finding local or sponsoring counsel, as the Undersigned did many times in his career without court \nassistance.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiff writes holographically , underneath the typewritten \nportion of his motion that, “This motion was done by A.i. [sic].” (ECF No. 5, \nPageID.22.)  That is a bad idea in one very real and important sense: Plaintiff will \nbe held responsible for the content of his filings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, including the accuracy of all facts and law, regardless of whether he used artificial intelligence to assist him.  Perhaps this explains why he requests pro hac vice  \nadmission for Mr. Metcalf and miscites the Local Rules in support, despite the prohibition against it in that very section of the Rule that he relie s upon.  The Court \nwill not accept A.I. as an excuse for inaccuracies  and will hold Plaintiff and all \ncounsel responsible for whatever filings appear with their signatures.   Plaintiff is \nDIRECTED to carefully read Fed. R. Civ. P. 11 in its entirety.      \n  In any case, for these reasons and those explained above with respect to his \nearlier motion regarding appointment of counsel, this motion is likewise DENIED . \n Case 2:25-cv-10524-SKD-APP   ECF No. 23, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 04/15/25   Page 8 of 9 \n9 \n  \nV. Pro Se Clinical Assistance  \nThere is a federal pro se  legal assistance clinic operated in the Courthouse by \nthe University of Detroit-Mercy Law School.  To determine if Plaintiff  is eligible \nfor assistance, he may contact the Federal Pro Se Legal Assistance Clinic at (313) \n234-2690 or at proseclinic@udmercy.edu.2 \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \n Dated:  April 15, 2025               _________________________   \nANTHONY P. PATTI  \n      UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE \n \n \n2 The attention of the parties is drawn to Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a), which provides a \nperiod of fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this order within which to file objections for consideration by the district judge under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1).  \nCase 2:25-cv-10524-SKD-APP   ECF No. 23, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 04/15/25   Page 9 of 9",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Aidong Chen, a former employee of KPMG, appealed a decision from the District Court which granted summary judgment in favor of KPMG, dismissing his claims of race and national origin discrimination and retaliation under Title VII. He alleged that his Caucasian colleagues at KPMG systematically undermined him to take credit for his work involving the use of graphical processing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence, leading to his termination. The court affirmed the dismissal, with key reasons including Chen's failure to establish a prima facie case of discrimination and retaliation, and procedural grounds for dismissing claims against individual defendants.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Aidong Chen provided sufficient evidence to support his claims of workplace discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Chen did not provide sufficient evidence to establish the necessary elements of a Title VII discrimination or retaliation claim. Specifically, he failed to show: (a) discriminatory motive tied to his termination, or (b) any causal connection between protected activities and adverse employment actions. It upheld the summary judgment for KPMG, dismissing his claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you made a cool project at work that involves smart computer stuff, and you believe your coworkers picked on you and took credit for it, which led to you being fired. You think this happened because you're different from them in terms of race and where you come from, so you go to court. However, the court says, \"You didn't bring enough proof that this was because of your race or origin or that you were punished for standing up for yourself.\" So, they ruled in favor of your workplace, saying they didn't break the law.",

Case: 21-1014     Document: 27     Page: 1      Date Filed: 09/29/2021 \n2 Pro se appellant Aidong Chen appeals from the District Court’s order granting \ndefendant KPMG’s motion for summary judgment .  For the following reasons, we will \naffirm the District Court’s judgment . \nI. \nAs we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and \nprocedural history, we will discuss the details only as th ey are relevant to our analysis.  \nChen worked at KPMG from 2014 until he was terminated in 2017.  He worked within \nLighthouse Operations Technology, a specialized research and development group.  \nAmong other projects, Chen facilitated and developed an init iative involving the use of \ngraphical processing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence.  Chen alleged that a group of \nhis Lighthouse colleagues and supervisors, all Caucasian men, systematically undermined \nand harassed him in order to steal credit for hi s work and gain control of the GPU project, \nleading to his termination.  He alleged that this treatment aligned with a broader pattern \nof discrimination within Lighthouse against non -Caucasian employees.  \nChen filed this suit in 2018, naming KPMG and three individuals as defendants \nand bringing claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for race and national \norigin discrimination and retaliation.  See 42 U.S.C. §  2000e -2(a).  The District Court \ngranted the individual defendants’ motion to dismiss  the claims against them.  The parties \nengaged in a tense discovery process, overseen by a Magistrate Judge.1  In October 2019, \n \n1 During the discovery process, Chen raised a new claim for relief based on alleged \nintellectual property issues surrounding the GPU project.  Chen never  sought to amend \nhis complaint to include this or any other claim in this action, but instead filed a separate Case: 21-1014     Document: 27     Page: 2      Date Filed: 09/29/2021 \n3 the case was reassigned to a new Magistrate Judge.  This second Magistrate Judge \nrejected Chen’s efforts to extend discovery an d permitted KPMG to file a motion for \nsummary judgment.  The District Court granted that motion and terminated Chen’s suit in \nan opinion and order entered on November 24, 2020.  Chen appeals.2 \nII. \nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §  1291.3  We review the District Court’s  \ngrant of a motion to dismiss de novo .  Newark Cab Ass’n. v. City of Newark , 901 F.3d \n146, 151 (3d Cir. 2018).   “We review a district court’s discovery orders for abuse of \ndiscretion, and will not disturb such an order absent a showing of actual and substantial \nprejudice.”  Anderson v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp. , 621 F.3d 261, 281 (3d Cir. 2010).   We \nexercise plenary review over a grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard \nthat the District Court applies.  Barna v. Bd. of Sch. Dirs. of Panther Valley Sch. Dist. , \n \nlawsuit.  See Complaint, Chen v. KPGM LLP , No. 2 -20-cv-09314 (D.N.J. July 27, 2020), \nECF No. 1.  Chen appealed the District Court’s eventual dism issal of that case.  C.A. No. \n21-1202.  \n2 The Defendants move to dismiss Chen’s appeal as untimely, citing the notice of appeal \nthat Chen mailed to this Court on December 23, 2021, and that we received on December \n31, 2021.  While that document cannot serve  as a timely notice of appeal in this case, \nChen had previously filed a document in the District Court (ECF No. 92) in which he \nclearly evinced his intent to appeal.  We construe that document, filed on November 25, \n2021, as his timely notice of appeal.  See 3d Cir. L.A.R. 3.4; see also  Smith v. Barry , 502 \nU.S. 244, 245 (1992) ( explaining that an appellate brief may be construed as notice of \nappeal); Rountree v. Balicki , 640 F.3d 530, 536 (3d Cir. 2011) (construing a pro se \nmotion for extension of time to f ile for a certificate of appealability as a notice of appeal ). \n3 In his brief, Chen raises an argument in passing regarding the District Court’s March \n2021 order granting KPMG’s motion for taxation of costs.  Appellant’s Br. 18 -19, 3d Cir. \nECF No. 17.  How ever, Chen did not appeal from that order, and we do not reach that \nissue.  Case: 21-1014     Document: 27     Page: 3      Date Filed: 09/29/2021 \n4 877 F.3d 136, 141 (3d Cir. 2017).  Summary judgment is appropriate “if the mo vant \nshows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  We “must view the facts and \nevidence presented in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.”  Razak v. Uber \nTechs., Inc. , 951 F.3d 137, 144 (3d Cir. 2020).  But that party may not rely on \nspeculation and conclusory allegations.  Id.  “We may affirm a district court for any \nreason supported by the record.”  Brightwell v. Lehman , 637 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir. \n2011).  \nIII. \nOn appeal, Chen offers few arguments concerning the substantive merits of the \nDistrict Court’s dispositive decisions.  Instead, he raises various procedural objections \nand baselessly alleges that the District Court and defendants conspired  against him.  We \nbriefly address Chen’s allegations before turning to the District Court’s dismissal of the \nindividual defendants and the grant of summary judgment as to KMPG.  \nChen claims that discovery was unfairly curtailed after the defendants failed t o \ncooperate with his requests.4  While “we tend to be flexible when applying procedural \n \n4 Because the second Magistrate Judge assigned to the case did not rule in Chen’s favor \non discovery matters, Chen baselessly alleges judicial bias and speculates that KPMG \ncorruptl y triggered the reassignment.  Chen’s allegations are frivolous.  Cf. Arrowpoint \nCap. Corp. v. Arrowpoint Asset Mgmt., LLC , 793 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2015) \n(“[A]dverse rulings —even if they are erroneous —are not in themselves proof of \nprejudice or bias .”). \nChen also repeatedly relies on misinterpretations of the record.  For instance, \ndefense counsel prepared a draft discovery confidentiality order including a provision \npermitting a producing party to modify the confidentiality designation applied to Case: 21-1014     Document: 27     Page: 4      Date Filed: 09/29/2021 \n5 rules to pro se litigants,” they ultimately “cannot flout” such rules and “must abide by the \nsame rules that apply to all other litigants.”  Mala v. Crown Bay Marina, Inc., 704 F.3d \n239, 244 -45 (3d Cir. 2013).  Chen was repeatedly advised to conform his discovery \nrequests and related motions to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures, Local Civil Rules, \nand relevant procedural orders in the case.  See Letter Order of Nove mber 19, 2018, ECF \nNo. 21; Letter Order of January 28, 2019; ECF No. 28; Pretrial Scheduling Order, ECF \nNo. 32; Order of July 17, 2019, ECF No. 42; Text Order of December 4, 2019, ECF No. \n56; Letter Order of March 6, 2020, ECF No. 62.  The District Court c onsidered and \nrejected Chen’s repetitive discovery arguments.  See Order of July 17, 2019, ECF No. 42; \nLetter Order of March 6, 2020, ECF No. 62; Text Order of June 16, 2020, ECF No. 78.  \nAfter reviewing the record, we discern no error in these discovery r ulings.  Furthermore, \nChen made no showing of actual prejudice because he has not explained how the \n \ndisco very material.  See ECF No. 25 at 30 -31.  Chen objected to this provision, \nmistakenly construing it as license to alter the discovery material itself, and Chen \ncontinues to cite this exchange as evidence of defense counsel’s malfeasance.  See, e.g.,  \nAppell ant’s Br. 9, 3d Cir. ECF No. 17.  Similarly, Chen’s account of a July 17, 2019 \nteleconference is not supported by the transcript in the record.  See ECF No. 60 at 2 -3.  \nThe Magistrate Judge, addressing recent letters filed by both Chen and defense counsel,  \nwarned both sides to refrain from “[m]aking scurrilous accusations” and expressed that \nhe had no interest in putting his education and legal training to use in dealing with such \nthings (although he would if necessary).  Id.  Chen misunderstood this refere nce to the \nMagistrate Judge’s legal education as a veiled reference to defense counsel’s legal \ncredentials and has repeatedly mischaracterized the exchange and the broader results of \nthe teleconference.  See, e.g. , Letter, ECF No. 58 at 3.  Case: 21-1014     Document: 27     Page: 5      Date Filed: 09/29/2021 \n6 discovery sought would have resolved the specific evidentiary deficiencies identified by \nthe District Court in granting KPMG’s motion for summary judgment.5 \nThe District Court correctly dismissed Chen’s claims against the individual \ndefendants because “individual employees are not liable under Title VII.”  Emerson v. \nThiel Coll. , 296 F.3d 184, 190 (3d Cir. 2002) (per curiam) .  Chen’s complaint identified \nonly Title VII claims. Compl. 5, ECF No. 1.  He could not bring such claims against the \nindividual defendants, and he never sought to amend his complaint to add any other \nclaims.  Chen does not dispute (or indeed acknowledge) this analysis, but he notes that \nthe District Court’s order stated that he did not oppose the defendants’ motion.  Letter \nOrder of May 6, 2019 at 1, ECF No. 35.  Chen did oppose the motion, albeit in an \nuntimely manner.6  But Chen’s filings did not address the legal basis of the defendan ts’ \nmotion.  While the District Court failed to note Chen’s opposition, the District Court did \nnot err in granting the individual defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims against them.  \nThe District Court granted KPMG’s motion for summary judgment because Chen \nfailed to provide evidence necessary to establish a prima facie case for either his \ndiscrimination or retaliation claims, leaving no genuine issues of material fact.  After \n \n5 Similarly, Che n implies that he was harmed because the District Court improperly \nsealed certain filings.  But sealed materials, while unavailable to the public, remain \navailable to the courts.  Chen was free to seek to submit under seal any confidential \ndiscovery materi als to the court in opposing summary judgment.  \n6 The defendants filed their motion on October 10, 2018.  On October 29, the defendants \nnoted that Chen had not filed a timely response pursuant to Local Civil Rule 7.1(d)(2).  \nChen first opposed the motion as  part of a collection of filings dated November 1.  Opp., \nECF No. 23 at 2 -3. Case: 21-1014     Document: 27     Page: 6      Date Filed: 09/29/2021 \n7 careful review of the record, we agree.7  On the summary judgment record, no reasonable \njury could find that the circumstances in question supported an inference of unlawful \ndiscrimination based on race or national origin, as required for Chen’s discrimination \nclaim.  See In re Tribune Media Co. , 902 F.3d 384, 40 2 (3d Cir. 2018) . 8  As to \nretaliation, Chen did not provide evidence that he engaged in applicable protected activity \nprior to any adverse action, let alone any causal connection between protected activi ty \nand adverse action.  See Moore v. City of Phila. , 461 F.3d 331, 340 -41 (3d Cir. 2006).  \nIV. \nAccordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.9\n \n7 Beyond seeking reversal of the District Court’s order, Chen provides no substantive \narguments concerning summary judgment on appeal and so forfeits any more detailed \nchallenge.  See M.S. ex rel. Hall v. Susquehanna Twp. Sch. Dist. , 969 F.3d 120, 124 n.3 \n(3d Cir. 2020).   \n8 In his complaint and opposition to the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Chen \nalleged that Lighthouse favored Caucasians and described Lighthouse’s trea tment of \nseveral other non -Caucasian employees.  The District Court treated these allegations as \nattempted “comparator evidence” and faulted Chen for failing to show that these other \nindividuals were similarly situated.  While a plaintiff can attempt to es tablish \ndiscrimination by showing that “the employer has treated more favorably similarly \nsituated persons not within the protected class,” Chen’s allegations concerning the \ntreatment of other non -Caucasian employees are better understood as attempts to sh ow \nthat “the employer has discriminated against other persons within the plaintiff’s protected \nclass or another protected class.”  Simpson v. Kay Jewelers, Div. of Sterling, Inc. , 142 \nF.3d 639, 645 (3d Cir. 1998).  In any case, Chen failed to submit any te stimony or other \nevidence concerning these allegations.  And even if Chen established a prima facie case, \nhe did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that KPMG’s explanation for his \ntermination was pretextual.  See In re Tribune , 902 F.3d at 402.  \n9 For the reasons given above, the defendants’ motion to dismiss the appeal is denied.  3d \nCir. ECF No. 12.  We also deny the requests for sanctions, reassignment of the case, and \ndirect relief against the defendants that Chen made in his brief.  Appellant’s Br . 9, 3d Cir. \nECF No. 17.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Rodrick Perkins, an African American man, alleged that he faced racial discrimination at The Alcove, an apartment complex managed by Village Green, after being falsely accused of sexual harassment and stalking, leading to his eviction. He sought damages and nullification of his eviction under federal and state laws, but procedural errors, such as improper service and an insufficient complaint, were highlighted. The court denied the motion to dismiss based on service issues but allowed Perkins to amend his complaint to better comply with legal standards, amid suggestions that AI might have generated parts of his original complaint.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Perkins' complaint should be dismissed due to improper service and failure to state a claim, and how he should proceed to address these procedural deficiencies.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court denied Defendants' motion to dismiss the case based on improper service but allowed Plaintiff to file an amended complaint to comply with federal pleading standards. Defendants' other arguments for dismissal were also denied without prejudice, allowing Perkins another opportunity to clarify his claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Rodrick Perkins says he was unfairly kicked out of his apartment because of racial bias. He went to court to fight this, but there were mix-ups in how he informed the people he’s suing. Also, his written complaint was too long and confusing, with parts that seemed like they might have been made by a computer. The judge decided not to end the case but told Rodrick he needs to start over and write a more straightforward explanation of what happened and what he wants, giving him a chance to continue his case.",

P a r k e r  v .         U n i t e d  S t a t e s  D i s t r i c t  J u d g e   THE ALCOVE TROY,      David R. Grand \n        United States Magistrate Judge \n  Defendants. ___________________ _________________/ \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMEN DATION AND ORDER \nON PENDING MOTIONS (ECF Nos. 14, 17, 29, 31)  \n \n Pro se  plaintiff Rodrick Perkins (“Perkins”) commenced this case on July 30, 2024, \nagainst The Alcove Tory (“The Alcove”), Cail ee Christie (“Christie”), Village Green, and \nJane Doe (collectively, “Defendants”).  In shor t, Perkins alleges that he had been renting \nan apartment at The Alcove, which was operate d by Village Green.  Perkins contends that \nChristie was the “property manager” and that “[ w]ithin five days of [Perkins] moving into \nThe Alcove [], Ms. Christie exhi bited behavior prompting concer ns of racial bias.”  (ECF \nNo. 1, PageID.14).  Perkins clai ms that he is an African Am erican man, and that he had \nonly “neighborly interactions” with white fema le residents of The Al cove, but that those \ninteractions were improperly reported as “sexual harassment and stalking.”  ( Id., \nPageID.14-15).  Ultimately, a po lice report was filed against Perkins, and he then “received \nan eviction notice based on fals e allegations of disturbing othe r residents’ right to use and \nenjoy the community by sexu ally harassing and stalking multiple residents.”  ( Id., \nPageID.20).  Perkins largely bl ames Christie for these events , and asserts claims for race Case 2:24-cv-11974-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 33, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 06/06/25   Page 1 of 7 \n2 \n discrimination in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and the Fa ir Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § \n3617, as well as a slew of state law claims, such as defamation, negligence, and wrongful \neviction.  Perkins seeks $1,2 00,000.00 in dama ges and asks the Court to “nullify” his \neviction proceedings.  ( Id., PageID.6).   \n On August 5, 2024, Perkins’  application to proceed in forma pauperis was granted, \nand service of process by the United States Marshal was orde red.  (ECF No . 5, 6).  The \nMarshal appears to have mailed service docu ments by certified mail to each of the \nDefendants at the addresses provided by Perkin s.  (ECF No. 10).  On  September 10, 2024, \na Certificate of Service card fo r The Alcove was retu rned to the Marshal.   (ECF No. 11).  \nHowever, no delivery date is indicated on the card, and it is signed by someone named \n“Bella” who did not indicate her relationship to The Alcove.  ( Id.).  The certified mail sent \nto Christie was returned  to the Marshal unopened.  (ECF No . 12).  No Certificate of Service \ndocument appears on the docket as to defendant Village Green.   \n A number of motions are now before the Court: \n On September 28, 2024, Perkins, “in the interest of focusing  on the remaining \ndefendants and simplifying the case,” moved to voluntarily dismiss defendant \nChristie without prejudi ce.  (ECF No. 14).   \n \n On October 16, 2024, a motion was filed on behalf of all of the named Defendants, \nThe Alcove, Village Green, and Christie.  (ECF No. 17) (“Motion to Dismiss”).  In \nthis motion, Defendants argue that, desp ite the aforementioned Certificate of \nService, The Alcove was not properly serv ed, and that Village Green and Christie \nwere also not served.  Thus, the Defendant s asked the Court to dismiss the complaint \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12( b)(5) for improper service.  ( Id., PageID.132-35).  \nDefendants also argued that Perkins’ compla int should be dismissed for failure to \nstate a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12 (b)(6) and for violating Rule 8’s pleading \nstandards.  Finally, Defendants argued that, if  the Court was not in clined to outright \ndismiss Perkins’ complaint, it should order hi m to file a more definite statement of \nhis claims against them.   Case 2:24-cv-11974-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 33, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 06/06/25   Page 2 of 7 \n3 \n  Despite filing an extremely lengthy1 response to Defendants’  Motion to Dismiss on \nOctober 30, 2024 (ECF No. 19), on May 14, 2025, Perkin s filed a motion for leave \nto file an additional response to De fendants’ motion.  (ECF No. 29).   \n \n Despite the fact that no discovery has taken place and Defendants are clearly \nchallenging Perkins’ claims both procedura lly and substantively,  on May 27, 2025, \nPerkins filed a motion for summar y judgment.  (ECF No. 31).   \n \nOn June 5, 2025, the Court held a tele phonic status conference regarding these \nmatters with Mr. Perkins and counsel to the De fendants.  Based on th e call, the Court makes \nthe following recommendations and rulings. Perkins’ Motion to Voluntarily Dismiss Defendant Ch ristie Without Prejudice (ECF \nNo. 14) \n \n As discussed below, it was agreed that Perkins may file an amended complaint.  \nThus, he will have the right in that document to include or not incl ude Ms. Christie as a \ndefendant, and the Court therefore sees no pr ejudice to defendant Christie by dismissing \nher from the case at this time.  Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED  that Perkins’ motion to \nvoluntarily dismiss defendant Christie is GRANTED .     \nDefendants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 17) \nOn the call, Defendants’ counsel indicat ed that, because counsel had already \nappeared on behalf of the named defendants , the remaining ones wo uld not object to the \nCourt exercising jurisdiction over them, provided  that their doing so would not waive their \nright to argue that Perkins’ otherwise allegedly untimely service  of the complaint bars his \n \n1 Perkins’ filing is a total of 55 pages in length, which alone is more than twice the allowable 25-\npage limit.  E.D. Mich. LR 7.1( d)(3)(A).  However, Perkins’ fi ling is actually many times longer \nthan twice the allowable page length because it is single-spaced and uses a small font, whereas \nLocal Rule 5.1(a)(2) and (3) require briefs to be doubled-spaced and use 14-point font.  In the \nfuture Perkins must comply with these Local Rules.   Case 2:24-cv-11974-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 33, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 06/06/25   Page 3 of 7 \n4 \n ability to recover under certain theories of lia bility, such as defamati on.  Perkins consented \nto that approach.  Accordingly, with th e understanding that Defendants’ statute of \nlimitations arguments based on un timely service are preserved, IT IS RECOMMENDED  \nthat their motion to dismiss fo r failure to properly serve (ECF No. 17)  should be DENIED .   \n To the extent Defendants moved the Court to dismiss Perkins’ complaint for failure \nto state a claim, or alternatively, to order hi m to file a more defini te statement as to his \nclaims, it was agreed that the most efficient way forward is to permit Perkins to file an \namended complaint that adheres to Rule 8’s pleading requirements , i.e., providing a \n“short and plain statement of th e grounds for the court’s juri sdiction,” “a short and plain \nstatement of the claim[s] showing that the pl eader is entitled to relief,” and “a demand for \nthe relief sought . . .”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(1)-(3).2  Accordingly, IT IS RECOMMENDED  \nthat these aspects of Defe ndants’ Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 17)  be DENIED \nWITHOUT PREJUDICE .  Perkins should be given 30 days  from today’s date to file an \namended complaint that adheres to Rule 8’s pleading standards.   \n  \n \n2 While the Court is sensitive to Perkins’ status as a pro se  litigant attempting to best advocate for \nhimself, his complaint is very far afield from co mplying with Rule 8.  It was more than 60-pages \nin length, single-spaced, and contains pages upon pa ges of rambling information that is either not \ndirectly related to the alleged facts that comprise  his claims, or which is more stream-of-conscious \nreflection than a short, plain statement of the salie nt facts.  Indeed, Defend ants posit that certain \naspects of Perkins’ complaint appear to be “gen erated in whole or in part by an artificial \nintelligence platform such as ChatGPT.”  (ECF  No. 17, PageID.112).  While Perkins has every \nright to include in his complaint whatever facts and information are necessa ry to state his claims, \nhe does not have a right to inunda te Defendants or the Court with the type of mini-novel complaint \nhe initially filed.  Again, Perkins’ amended complaint shall focus on the specific facts that he contends give rise to the clai ms he is asserting, including iden tifying specific conduct by specific \ndefendants.   Case 2:24-cv-11974-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 33, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 06/06/25   Page 4 of 7 \n5 \n Perkins’ Motion for Leave to File an Addi tional Response to De fendants’ Motion to \nDismiss (ECF No. 29)  \n \n Because the Court has recommended deny ing Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss there \nis no need for Perkins to file  an additional response to that motion.  Accordingly, IT IS \nORDERED  that Perkins’ motion for leav e to file such a response (ECF No. 29)  is \nDENIED AS MOOT .   \nPerkins’ Motion for Summary Judgme nt (ECF No. 31) \nAs noted above, despite the fact that no  discovery has taken place and Defendants \nare clearly challenging Perkins’ claims both procedurally and substantively, Perkins has \nfiled a motion for summary judgment.  (ECF No . 31).  A moving party with the burden of \nproof (typically the plaintiff) faces a “substa ntially higher hurdle ” to obtain summary \njudgment than the party without that burden (typi cally the defendant).  Arnett v. Myers , \n281 F.3d 552, 561 (6th Cir. 200 2).  Whereas the moving party without the burden of proof \nneeds only show th at the opponent cannot sustain his burden at trial, “where the moving \nparty has the burden – the plaintiff on a claim for relief or the defendant on an affirmative \ndefense – his showing must be sufficient for the court to hold that no reasonable trier of \nfact could find other than for the moving party.”  Calderone v. U.S. , 799 F.2d 254, 259 (6th \nCir. 1986) (internal citations omitted).  Accord ingly, summary judgment in favor of the \nplaintiff “is inappropriate when the evidence is sus ceptible of different interpretations or \ninferences by the trier of fact.”  Harris v. Kowalski , No. 1:05-cv-722, 2006 WL 1313863, \nat *3 (W.D. Mich. May 12, 2006) (quoting Hunt v. Cromartie , 526 U.S. 541, 553 (1999)). \nHere, discovery has not yet taken pl ace, Defendants are mounting various Case 2:24-cv-11974-LVP-DRG   ECF No. 33, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 06/06/25   Page 5 of 7 \n6 \n challenges to Perkins’ claims, and Perkins has not shown that “no reasonable trier of fact \ncould find other than for [him].”  Calderone v. U.S. , 799 F.2d 254, 259.  Accordingly, it \nwould be premature and improper to grant su mmary judgment in Perkins’ favor at this \ntime.  Accordingly, IT IS RECOMMENDED  that Perkins’ motion for summary judgment \n(ECF No. 31)  be DENIED .   \n \nDated: June 6, 2025      s/David R.

Wells Fargo Bank N.A., Inc., the plaintiff, proceeding pro se, alleges various legal violations related to the repossession of his 2019 Chevrolet Tahoe. The court denied most of Gordon's motions, except to extend the time to respond to Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss, while cautioning him to adhere to legal standards, notably concerning the use of AI in legal research. This case notably involves AI as the court suspects the plaintiff is using AI for research and drafting, leading to the citation of fictitious cases.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Gordon's motions regarding procedural and substantive matters in his lawsuit against Wells Fargo are legally justified and properly supported.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court denied all of Gordon's motions except to grant him more time to respond to Wells Fargo's motion to dismiss. It also warned Gordon against filing further motions until resolved and cautioned against using AI without verifying sources, given the submission of suspect legal citations.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're playing a game, and you keep asking the referee for extra chances or to redo parts of the game because you think the rules weren't followed right.

 and Motion to Strike.  \nAs explained  below, all of Plaintiff’s  Motions are denied except his request for \nadditional  time to respond to Defendant’s  Motion to Dismiss.  Moreover,  the Court \nWARNS  Plaintiff that the violation  of his Rule 11 obligations  will result in sanctions.  Case 5:24-cv-00388-CAR     Document 19     Filed 04/08/25     Page 1 of 92 \n Plaintiff is further DIRECTED  (1) not to file any more motions or other filings until the \nCourt issues its ruling on Defendant’s  pending Motion to Dismiss or directs the parties \notherwise,  and (2) to voluntarily  withdraw  his meritless  claims, as further explained  \nbelow. \nPlaintiff’s  Motion for More Definite Statement  \nPlaintiff moved for a more definite statement  in relation to Defendant’s  Motion to \nDismiss.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  12(e), “a party may move for a more \ndefinite statement  of a pleading  to which a responsive  pleading  is allowed but which is \nso vague or ambiguous  that the party cannot reasonably  prepare a response.”  Because a \nMotion to Dismiss is not a “pleading,”  Plaintiff cannot move for a definite statement  of \nit. Plaintiff “acknowledges  that he erroneously  filed” this Motion.1 Thus, Plaintiff’s  \nMotion for More Definite Statement  [Doc. 7] is DENIED . \nPlaintiff’s  Motion for Leave to Issue Rule 45 Subpoenas  and Rule 56(D) Motion to Stay \nProceedings  Pending Third‐Party Subpoena  \n \nPlaintiff moves for leave to issue subpoenas  under Rule 45 to the Georgia \nDepartment  of Revenue  and Five Star Chevrolet,  and for a stay of the proceedings  \npending issuance  of and response  to the subpoenas.  But discovery  in this case has not yet \nbegun. Thus, these Motions are premature.  If this case proceeds  past Defendant’s  \n \n1 Plaintiff’s  Combined  Motion [Doc. 9 at 2]. Case 5:24-cv-00388-CAR     Document 19     Filed 04/08/25     Page 2 of 93 \n currently  pending Motion to Dismiss,  the Court will issue a Rules 16 and 26 Order to the \nparties that will govern the course of discovery.  Thus, these Motions [Docs. 14, 15] are \nDENIED  as premature . \nMotion to Strike Defendant  Wells Fargo’s Filings and Bar Further Defense \nPlaintiff moves to strike Defendant’s  filings and bar it from filing any further \npleadings  or responses  in this case arguing Defendant  “lacks Article III standing.”2 But \nPlaintiff misunderstands  and misapplies  the doctrine of standing.  “Article III of the \nConstitution  limits the jurisdiction  of federal courts to ‘cases’ and ‘controversies,’  and \n‘[s]tanding  to sue is a doctrine rooted in the traditional  understanding  of a case or \ncontroversy.”3 “To have standing,  plaintiffs  must therefore  establish  that they ‘(1) \nsuffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable  to the challenged  conduct of the \ndefendant,  and (3) that is likely to be redressed  by a favorable  judicial decision.’”4 “At \nleast one plaintiff must have standing  to seek each form of relief requested  in the \ncomplaint.”5 “The party invoking  federal jurisdiction  bears the burden of proving \nstanding.”6 A defendant  responding  to a lawsuit, like Wells Fargo, has no such burden. \nBecause Plaintiff has invoked federal jurisdiction  by filing this lawsuit, he bears the \n \n2 Plaintiff’s  Motion to Strike [Doc. 18 at 1]. \n3 Wilding v. DNC Servs. Corp. , 941 F.3d 1116, 1124 (11th Cir. 2019) (quoting  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 136 S. Ct. \n1540, 1547 (2016)). \n4 Id. (quoting  Spokeo, Inc., 136 S. Ct. at 1547). \n5 Id. (citing Town of Chester v. Laroe Ests., 137 S. Ct. 1645, 1651 (2017)). \n6 Bischoff v. Osceola Cnty., Fla., 222 F.3d 874, 878 (11th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).  Case 5:24-cv-00388-CAR     Document 19     Filed 04/08/25     Page 3 of 94 \n burden of proving standing.  Defendant  Wells Fargo does not have to prove it has \nstanding  to defend itself in Plaintiff’s  lawsuit. Plaintiff’s  arguments  Defendant  “lacks \nstanding”  to defend this suit are meritless,  and he should refrain from making this \nargument  again. Thus, Plaintiff’s  Motion to Strike [Doc. 18] is DENIED.   \nPlaintiff’s  Combined  Motions to Compel Specificity,  Extend Time to Respond,  Set Aside \nPrior Judgment,  and to Take Judicial Notice \n \nPlaintiff files a “combined”  Motion to (1) extend time to respond to Defendant’s  \nMotion to Dismiss;

Motion to Compel Specificity  \nPlaintiff’s  argument  that Defendant  is required  to specify which RISC it enforced  \nis meritless.  If this case proceeds  past Defendant’s  currently  pending Motion to Dismiss,  \nPlaintiff may engage in discovery.  Thus, Plaintiff’s  Motion to Compel Specificity  is \nDENIED.  Case 5:24-cv-00388-CAR     Document 19     Filed 04/08/25     Page 4 of 95 \n ii. Motion to Set Aside Judgment  \nPlaintiff moves to set aside the judgment  in his original federal case, Gordon v. \nWells Fargo N.A., Inc., Case No. 5:22‐cv‐458‐MTT, pursuant  to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure  60(b)(4) – (6) and 60(d). “A motion [under Rule 60(b)] for relief from final \njudgment  must be filed in the district court and in the action in which the original \njudgment  was entered.”7 Because Plaintiff improperly  seeks to set aside the judgment  \nfrom his previous  lawsuit,8 the Court DISMISSES  the Motion. \niii. Motion to Take Judicial Notice \nPlaintiff moves for the Court to take judicial notice of four exhibits pursuant  to \nFederal Rule of Evidence  201(b). Pursuant  to Federal Rule of Evidence  201, a district court \nmay take judicial notice of a fact that is “not subject to reasonable  dispute”  because it “(1) \nis generally  known within the trial court’s territorial  jurisdiction;  or (2) can be accurately  \nand readily determined  from sources whose accuracy  cannot reasonably  be questioned,”  \nincluding  public records.9 The documents  Plaintiff submitted  are his private \ncorrespondence,  personal  contracts,  and Georgia Department  of Motor Vehicles records. \nThe first three exhibits are not public records; as such, they are not proper subjects for \n \n7 Cascella v. Canaveral  Port Dist. , 197 F. App’x 839, 842 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting  Bankers Mortg. Co. v. United \nStates , 432 F.2d 73, 78 (5th Cir. 1970)). \n8 It appears that Plaintiff has now filed another Rule 60 Motion in the previous  action. \n9 Chinn v. PNC Bank, N.A., 451 F. App’x 859, 860 n.1 (11th Cir. 2012). Case 5:24-cv-00388-CAR     Document 19     Filed 04/08/25     Page 5 of 96 \n judicial notice.10 As for the Georgia Department  of Motor Vehicles records, the Court has \n“wide discretion”  to take judicial notice of facts, including  public records.11 The Court \ndeclines to take judicial notice of these documents  because it is unnecessary  at this time. \nThus, Plaintiff’s  Motion for Judicial Notice is DENIED.  \nRule 11 Sanctions  \nAlthough  Plaintiff is well aware of his Rule 11 obligations—Judge  Treadwell  \nreminded  Plaintiff about them in his Order dismissing  Plaintiff’s  claims against Wells \nFargo in Plaintiff’s  previous  lawsuit12—the Court will again remind Plaintiff of the \naffirmative  duties Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  11 places on attorneys  and pro se \nlitigants.  Specifically,  Rule 11(b) states:  \nBy presenting  to the court (whether  by signing, filing, submitting,  or later \nadvocating)  a pleading,  written motion, or other paper, an attorney or \nunrepresented  party is certifying  that to the best of the personʹs knowledge,  \ninformation,  and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable  under the \ncircumstances:  \n(1) it is not being presented  for any improper  purpose,  such as to harass or \nto cause unnecessary  delay or needless  increase in the cost of litigation;

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\nThis court case involves a civil rights complaint filed by Lindsay Spilsbury against Carice, Seth, and Vera Demchok. Spilsbury alleges that the defendants exploited her using artificial intelligence by creating an account in her name on an online gaming platform and selling her identity on the dark web, among other claims. The court granted Spilsbury's request to proceed without prepaying fees but ordered her to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for failing to state a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and potential jurisdictional issues due to related state court proceedings.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe primary legal issue is whether Spilsbury’s complaint sufficiently alleges a violation of her federally protected rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by the defendants acting under the color of state law, and whether the court has jurisdiction considering ongoing related state court proceedings.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court granted Spilsbury's application to proceed in forma pauperis but ordered her to amend her complaint to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for failing to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and for being barred by the Younger abstention and Rooker-Feldman doctrines. The court gave her 21 days to respond with an amended complaint that addresses these issues.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine someone is trying to sue some people because they think they were wronged, but they don't have enough money to pay the court fees. The court allowed this person to proceed without paying up front. However, the court isn't sure if it can actually handle the case, partly because another similar case might already be happening in a different court. The person has to explain more about their case to convince the court why it should be the one to deal with it. If not, the case could be thrown out. In this situation, she also claims that some technology, like robots or AI, was used to cause her harm, but she needs to clarify her story and how exactly the law was broken.",

No. 2:25-cv-00646-KRS CARICE DEMCHOK, \nSETH DEMCHOK and VERA DEMCHOK, \n  Defendants. \nORDER GRANTING APPLICATION TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS  \nAND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \n \n THIS MATTER  comes before the Court on pro se  Plaintiff’s Civil Rights Complaint \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“ Complaint”), (Doc. 1), file d July 9, 2025, and Plaintiff’s \nApplication to Proceed in District Court Without Prepaying Fees or Costs (“Application”), (Doc. \n2), filed July 9, 2025. \nI. APPLICATION TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS  \n The statute for proceedings in forma pauperis , 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a), provides that the Court \nmay authorize the commencement of any suit without  prepayment of fees by a person who submits \nan affidavit that includes a stat ement of all assets the person posse sses and that the person is unable \nto pay such fees.  \nWhen a district court receives an applica tion for leave to proceed  in forma pauperis, \nit should examine the papers and determine if the requirements of [28 U.S.C.] § 1915(a) are satisfied. If they are, leave should be granted. Thereafter, \nif the court finds that the allegations of  poverty are untrue or that the action is \nfrivolous or malicious, it  may dismiss the case[.] \n \nMenefee v. Werholtz , 368 Fed.Appx. 879, 884 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing Ragan v. Cox , 305 F.2d 58, \n60 (10th Cir. 1962). “The statute [allowing a litig ant to proceed in form a pauperis] was intended Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 1 of 62 \n for the benefit of those too poor to pay or give security for costs....” Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de \nNemours & Co.,  335 U.S. 331, 344 (1948). While a litigant n eed not be “absolutely destitute,” “an \naffidavit is sufficient which states that one canno t because of his poverty pa y or give security for \nthe costs and still be able to provide himsel f and dependents with th e necessities of life.” Id. at \n339.   The Court grants Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed in District Court Without Prepaying \nFees or Costs. Plaintiff signed an affidavit st ating she is unable to pay the costs of these \nproceedings and provided the following information:  (i) Plaintiff’s average monthly income during \nthe past 12 months is $2,600.00; (i i) Plaintiff has $600.00 in a bank acc ount; (iii) Plaintiff has three \nsons who rely on her for support; and (iv) Plaintiff states: “I have limited income temporary support \nto survive.”\n1 The Court finds that Plaintiff is unable to  pay the costs of this proceeding because \nPlaintiff signed an affidavit stating she is unable to pay the costs of these proceedings and Plaintiff \nhas three sons who re ly on her for support. \nII. ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \n Plaintiff filed her Complaint using the form “Civil Rights Complaint Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” Where the Complaint form prompt s plaintiffs to indica te whether defendants \nwere acting under color of state la w, Plaintiff marked the “Yes” box. See Complaint at 1, 3. Plaintiff \nalleges Defendants have opened an account on the online gaming platform “Steam” using her \nname, stalk her using a fl ying aircraft, have used robots and artificial intelligence to exploit \nPlaintiff, and sold Plaintiff’s identity to the dark web. See Complaint at 2-12.  \nThe Complaint fails to state claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. “The two elements of a \nSection 1983 claim are (1) depriv ation of a federally protected right by (2) an actor acting under \n \n1 Plaintiff states her monthly expenses include $300.00 for rent and $300.00 for a rental car but did not state her \nmonthly amounts for utilities, food, clothing, medical and dental or other expenses. Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 2 of 63 \n color of state law.” Schaffer v. Salt Lake City Corp. , 814 F.3d 1151, 1155 (10th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff \nhas not alleged any facts showing that Defenda nts were acting under color of state law.  \n Plaintiff states she has begun other lawsuits in the Third Judicial District Court dealing \nwith the same facts in volved in this action. See Complaint at 13. It appe ars the Court may lack \njurisdiction over this case pursuant to the Younger  abstention doctrine and/or the Rooker-Feldman  \ndoctrine due to the st ate court proceedings. \nThe Younger  abstention doctrine “dictate s that federal courts not interfere with state court \nproceedings . . . when such relief could adeq uately be sought before the state court.” Rienhardt v. \nKelly , 164 F.3d 1296, 1302 (10th Cir. 1999); D.L. v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 497 , 392 F.3d 1223, \n1228 (10th Cir. 2004) (“ Younger  abstention is jurisdictional”) (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a \nBetter Env. , 523 U.S. 83, 100 n.3 (1998)). In determining whether Younger  abstention is \nappropriate, the Court considers whether: \n(1) there is an ongoing state . . . civil . . . proceeding, (2) the state court provides an \nadequate forum to hear the claims raised in the federal complaint, and (3) the state \nproceedings involve important state intere sts, matters which traditionally look to \nstate law for their resolution or implicate separately articulated state policies. Younger  abstention is non-discretionary; it  must be invoked once the three \nconditions are met, absent ex traordinary circumstances.  \n \nAmanatullah v. Colo. Bd. of Med. Exam’rs , 187 F.3d 1160, 1163 (10th Cir. 1999) (citations \nomitted).  \nThe Rooker-Feldman  doctrine:  \nbars federal district cour ts from hearing cases “br ought by state-co urt losers \ncomplaining of injuries caused by state-c ourt judgments rendered before the district \ncourt proceedings commenced and inviting di strict court review and rejection of \nthose judgments.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp. , 544 U.S. 280, \n284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). Wh ere the relief requested would \nnecessarily undo the stat e court’s judgment, Rooker-Feldman  deprives the district \ncourt of jurisdiction. Mo’s Express, 441 F.3d at 1237.  Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 3 of 64 \n Velasquez v. Utah , 775 Fed.Appx. 420, 422 (10th Cir. 2019);  Knox v. Bland , 632 F.3d 1290, 1292 \n(10th Cir. 2011) (“Under [the Rooker-Feldman ] doctrine, ‘a party losing in state court is barred \nfrom seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a United States \ndistrict court, based on the losi ng party’s claim that the state j udgment itself violates the loser’s \nfederal rights’“) (quoting Johnson v. De Grandy , 512 U.S. 997, 1005-06 (1994)). \nAs the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of  this Court, Plaintiff bears the burden of \nalleging facts that s upport jurisdiction. See Dutcher v. Matheson , 733 F.3d 980, 985 (10th Cir. \n2013) (“Since federal courts are courts of limite d jurisdiction, we presume no jurisdiction exists \nabsent an adequate showing by the party invoking federal jurisdiction”); Evitt v. Durland , 243 F.3d \n388, at *2 (10th Cir. 2000) (“even if  the parties do not raise the que stion themselves, it is our duty \nto address the apparent lack of  jurisdiction sua sponte”) (quoting Tuck v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n,  \n859 F.2d 842, 843 (10th Cir.1988).    The Court orders Plaintiff to show cause  why the Court should not dismiss this case \npursuant to Younger  and/or Rooker-Feldman and for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. If Plaintiff asserts the Court should not dismiss this case, Pl aintiff must file an \namended complaint that states a claim upon which re lief can be granted and that shows that this \ncase is not barred by Younger  and/or Rooker-Feldman . Plaintiff must identify each case in state \ncourt dealing with the same facts involved in this  action including the name of the courts and the \ncase numbers. Plaintiff must also indicate whethe r the state court proceeding is ongoing, has been \ndismissed and whether Plaintiff has appealed any final judgment in the st ate court proceeding. The \namended complaint must comply with the Federa l and Local Rules of Civil Procedure and must \nstate a claim over which th e Court has jurisdiction. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(b) (“A party must state \nits claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs”); Nasious v. Two Unknown B.I.C.E. Agents, at Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 4 of 65 \n Arapahoe Cnty.

III. NOTICE OF CASE MANAGEMENT \nGenerally, pro se  litigants are held to the same standards of professional \nresponsibility as traine d attorneys. It is a pro se  litigant’s responsibility to become \nfamiliar with and to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  and the Local \nRules of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico  (the “Local \nRules”).  \nGuide for Pro Se Litigants at 4, United States Di strict Court, District of New Mexico (October \n2022). The Local Rules, the Guide for Pro Se Litig ants and a link to the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure are available on the Court’s website: http://www.nmd.uscourts.gov . \nFailure to comply with Court Orders and the Federal and Local Rules of Civil Procedure \ninterferes with the judi cial process and may result in mo netary and non-monetary sanctions \nincluding filing restrictions and dismissal of this case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) (“If the plaintiff \nfails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss \nthe action”); Gustafson v. Luke , 696 Fed.Appx. 352, 354 (10th Cir. 2017) (“Although the language \nof Rule 41(b) requires that th e defendant file a motion to di smiss, the Rule  has long been \ninterpreted to permit cour ts to dismiss actions sua  sponte for a plaintiff’s failure to prosecute or \ncomply with the rules of civil proc edure or court’s orders.”) (quoting Olsen v. Mapes , 333 F.3d \n1199, 1204 n.3 (10th Cir. 2003)). IV. COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 11  \nThe Court reminds Plaintiff of her obligations pu rsuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. See Yang v. Archuleta , 525 F.3d 925, 927 n. 1 (10th Cir. 2008) (“ Pro se  status Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 5 of 66 \n does not excuse the obligation of any litigant to comply with the fundament al requirements of the \nFederal Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure.”). Rule 11(b) provides: \nRepresentations to the Court.  By presenting to the court a pleading, written \nmotion, or other paper--whether by signi ng, filing, submitting, or later advocating \nit--an attorney or unrepresent ed party certifies that to  the best of the person’s \nknowledge, information, and belief, formed  after an inquiry reasonable under the \ncircumstances:  (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause \nunnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;  (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal c ontentions are warranted by existing law \nor by a nonfrivolous argument for extendi ng, modifying, or reversing existing law \nor for establishing new law;  (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, \nwill likely have evidentiary support afte r a reasonable opportunity for further \ninvestigation or discovery; and  (4) the denials of factual contentions ar e warranted on the evidence or, if \nspecifically so identified, are reasonably ba sed on belief or a la ck of information. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 11(b). Failure to comply with th e requirements of Rule 11 may subject Plaintiff to \nsanctions, including monetary pena lties and nonmonetary directives. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(c).  \n IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that: \n(i) Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed in District Court Without Prepaying Fees or \nCosts, Doc. 2, filed July 9, 2025, is GRANTED.  \n(ii) Plaintiff shall, within 21 days of entry of this Order: (a) show cause why the Court \nshould not dismiss this case; and (b) file an amended complaint. Failure to timely \nshow cause and file an amended complaint may result in dismissal of this case. \n IT IS SO ORDERED. \n \n \n       __________________________________ \n       K E V I N  R .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Jeramiah Brown, a former employee of Fat Dough Inc., claimed employment discrimination, alleging retaliation and harassment under ADA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The court found insufficient evidence to support Brown's claims of retaliation and sexual harassment, noting that the conduct he experienced was not severe or pervasive enough to constitute a hostile work environment, and ruled in favor of the Defendant's motion for summary judgment. The case involved artificial intelligence as the Plaintiff had used AI, specifically ChatGPT, to draft legal documents, leading to issues with factual accuracy and citations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Plaintiff, Jeramiah Brown, provided sufficient evidence to support claims of ADA and Title VII violations, including retaliation and a hostile work environment, and whether the Plaintiff's alleged adverse actions were genuinely connected to protected activity under these statutes.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Brown's motions for sanctions and summary judgment while granting summary judgment in favor of Fat Dough Inc., concluding that Brown voluntarily resigned rather than being retaliated against or constructively discharged, and that the alleged workplace conduct did not amount to a legally recognizable hostile work environment.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Jeramiah Brown, who used to deliver pizzas, said his boss's company made life at work really hard and did mean things to him. He wanted the court to punish his boss's company for being unfair. The court checked if Brown had a strong case to prove this but found that the troubles at work weren't bad enough to punish the company. Also, Brown used a computer AI \"helper\" to make his court papers, and the computer made up some stuff that wasn't true, causing more trouble in proving his story. So, the court said Brown's case couldn't win, closed it, and said he should be more careful with AI tools next time.",

No. 80, and Magistrate Judge Miroslav Lovric denied \nthe motion, Dkt. No. 81.  Plaintiff “renewed” the motion for sanctions in a “renewed Motion for \nSanctions and Summary Judgment,” Dkt. No. 88.  To resolve all of the legal issues before the Court, and in light of Plaintiff’s pro se status, the Court has reviewed both of those motions.

According to Plaintiff, during this tour Filkins told him that if he delivered pizzas to a certain \npart of the base, then  he risked having soldiers “require [Plaintiff] to give them oral se x.” Pl. Dep. \nat 18 .  Defendant does not address this in its Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, but states \nthat Filkins did not ask  Plaintiff to perform oral sex.  Id . at 18; Def. SUMF ¶ 21. Plaintiff does not \nrefer to any other conversations involving sex.    \n \n2 The facts are drawn from the parties’ submissions including Defendant’s S tatement of Material \nFacts, (Def.

SUMF  ¶ 31 -32.  \nPlaintiff claims that on October 27\nth, another employee threw dirty water and mushrooms \nat Plaintiff while Plaintiff was washing dishes.  Am. Compl. at 4.  Plaintiff  also claims that on \napproximately October 28th, someone broke into his  car5 in a parking lot and drew a “smiley face” \non the inside of his windshield with pizza grease.  Def.

No. 87-3 ¶ 40 ( p. \n23), and ¶ 40 ( p. 25) , but also offered evidence that he “consistently locked his vehicle during \ndeliveries,” id . ¶ 40 p. 22. \n \n6 Plaintiff later suggests that that there may not have been a camera, stating “management’s failure \nto activate or maintain functional surveillance equipment violates their own security protocols, \ncompromising the integrity of the investigation.”  Dkt. No. 87-3 ¶ 39 (p. 22).

According to Fat Dough, th e resignation w as “voluntary ,” \nbut Plaintiff claims that it was “coerced by ongoing harassment and discriminatory practices.”  \nDkt. No. 87- 3 ¶ 45 (p. 31).  According to Plaintiff, supervisor Brian Galloway called him on \nOctober 29, 2021, the day after the windshield incident, and terminated his employment  because \nPlaintiff filed a police report .\n7  Dkt. No. 87- 3 ¶5-13 (p. 4- 5); Dkt. No. 87 -4 at 60; Pl.

Legal Standard  \nUnder Rule 56(a), summary judgment may be granted only if all the submissions taken \ntogether “show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); see \nalso Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247- 48 (1986).  The moving party bears the \ninitial burden of demonstrating “the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.” Celotex , 477 U.S. \nat 323.  A fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law,” and is genuinely in dispute “if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248; see also Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549, 553 (2d Cir. 2005) (citing Anderson).  The mova nt may meet this burden by showing that the \nnonmoving party has “fail[ed] to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex , \n477 U.S. at 322; see also Selevan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth., 711 F.3d 253, 256 (2d Cir. 2013) (explaining that summary judgment is appropriate where the nonmoving party fails to “‘come forth with evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to return a verdict i n his or her favor on’ an \nessential element of a claim” (quoting In re Omnicom Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., 597 F.3d 501, 509 (2d Cir. 2010))).  \nIf the moving party meets this burden, the nonmoving party must “set out specific facts \nshowing a genuine issue for trial.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 250; see also Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323-24; Wright v. Goord, 554 F.3d 255, 266 (2d Cir. 2009).  “When ruling on a summary judgment \nmotion, the district court must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the non- moving \nparty and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the m ovant.”  Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 5 of 166 \n Dallas Aerospace, Inc. v. CIS Air Corp., 352 F.3d 775, 780 (2d Cir. 2003).  Still, the nonmoving \nparty “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts,” Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986), and cannot \nrely on “mere speculation or conjecture as to the true nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment,” Knight v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., 804 F.2d 9, 12 (2d Cir. 1986) (quoting Quarles v. Gen. Motors Corp., 758 F.2d 839, 840 (2d Cir. 1985)).  Furthermore, “[m]ere conclusory allegations or denials . . . cannot by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact where none would otherwise exist.” Hicks v. Baines , 593 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting Fletcher v. \nAtex, Inc. , 68 F.3d 1451, 1456 (2d Cir. 1995)).  \nWhen considering cross -motions for summary judgment, a court “must evaluate each \nparty’s motion on its own merits, taking care in each instance to draw all reasonable inferences against the party whose motion is under consideration.”  Hotel Emp. & Rest. Emp. Union, Local 100 of New York, N.Y. & Vicinity v. City of New York Dep’ t of Parks & Recreation , 311 F.3d 534, \n543 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Heublein v. United States , 996 F.2d 1455, 1461 (2d Cir. 1993) (internal \nquotation marks omitted)). \nWhen a plaintiff is proceeding pro se , the court “reads his pleadings ‘ liberally and \ninterpret [s] them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.’ ”  Jorgensen v. Epic/Sony \nRecs. , 351 F.3d 46, 50 (2d Cir. 2003)  (quoting McPherson v. Coombe, 174 F.3d 276, 280 (2d Cir.  \n1999) ).  The “application of this different standard does not relieve plaintiff of his duty to meet the \nrequirements necessary to defeat a motion for summary judgment.” Id .   \n“While it is undoubtedly the duty of district courts not to weigh the credibility of the parties \nat the summary judgment stage, in the rare circumstance where the plaintiff relies almost exclusively on his own testimony, much of which is contradictory and i ncomplete, it will be Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 6 of 167 \n impossible for a district court to determine whether the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff, \nand thus whether there are any ‘genuine’ issues of material fact, without making some assessment \nof the plaintiff ’s account.”  Jeffreys , 426 F.3d at  554 (cleaned up).  “[W]hen the facts alleged are \nso contradictory that doubt is cast upon their plausibility,” a court is “authorized to pierce the veil of the complaint’s factual allegations, dispose of some improbable allegations, and dismiss the claim.”  Az iz Zarif Shabazz v. Pico, 994 F. Supp. 460, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)  (quoting Denton v. \nHernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 32 (1992)) (cleaned up). \nIII. Discussion  \nA. Plaintiff’s Motion s for Summary Judgment and Sanctions\n8 \n1. Sanctions  \nPlaintiff seeks  sanctions against Defendant for allegedly harassing Plaintiff with \ncounterclaims and “retaliatory conduct.”  Dkt. Nos. 80 at 2; 88 at 1.  Plaintiff’s initial motion for \nsanctions was denied, Dkt. No. 81, and Plaintiff raises largely the same arguments in his renewed \nmotion , Dkt. No. 88.   \nPlaintiff’s renewed motion is mostly conclusory language without any factual assertions \nthat could support his request.  In addition, contrary to Plaintiff’s assertions, Defendant did not file  \nany counterclaims against Plaintiff.  Finally, Plaintiff has not described any specific “retaliatory \nconduct.”  Dkt. No. 88 at 3.  Plaintiff’s renewed motion for sanctions is therefore denied. \nIt appears, however, that P laintiff could be sanctioned because he included at least one \nfictitious legal citation  in his  submissions : “Lynch v. U.S. Postal Service , 2016 WL 7338415 \n \n8 Plaintiff repeatedly  asks for Magistrate Judge Lovric  to be recused  in his “Renewed Motion for \nSummary Judgment and Sanctions,” but those requests will not be considered because a summary \njudgment motion is  not the appropriate kind of motion to raise those requests, and the underlying \narguments have already been addressed .  See  Dkt. No. 81.   Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 7 of 168 \n (N.D.N.Y . Dec. 19, 2016) .”  Dkt. No. 80 at 4.  That Westlaw citation  is for a n unrelated  habeas \ncorpus case: Green v. New York , No. 14- cv-2073, 2016 WL 7338415 (S.D.N.Y . Dec. 19, 2016) .  \nAlthough there are several cases with the caption, “Lynch v. U.S. Postal Service,” none were issued \nby this court or in 2016.  See Lynch v. U.S. Postal Serv., 17 F. App’ x 996 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ; Lynch \nv. U.S. Postal Serv., 3 F. App’ x 287 (6th Cir. 2001) ; Lynch v. U.S. Postal Serv., 127 F. App’ x 487 \n(Fed. Cir. 2005) ; Lynch v. U.S. Postal Serv., 316 F. App’x 972 (Fed. Cir. 2008).   \nAll litigants, including pro se litigants, must make sure that all assertions of fact and law \nin their submissions are true.  Fed R. Civ. P. 11(b) .  If a litigant cannot verify a  legal assertion , the \nlitigant should omit the assertion rather than include a false statement.   Plaintiff testified that he \nused ChatGPT to draft legal papers.  Dkt. No. 89 -1 at 5-10.  It is well established  that artificial \nintelligence regularly “hallucinates” and includes false statements.   See Benjamin v. Costco \nWholesale Corp., No. 2:24- cv-7399, 2025 WL 1195925 (E.D.N.Y . Apr. 24, 2025) (“In recent years, \ncourts across the country have continued to receive submissions littered with AI -generated ‘case’ \ncitations  . . . . This epidemic of citing fake cases has continued unabated, and, by way of example, \nthe undersigned has identified at least four reported cases in the rece nt weeks  confronting this very \nsame issue.”) (collecting cases ); see also  Jeff Neal, The Legal Profession in 2024: AI , HARV . L. \nTODAY (Feb. 14, 2024), https://hls.harvard.edu/today/harvard- law-expert-explains-how- ai-may-\ntransform -the- legal -profession -in-2024/ . \nThe Court has decided not to impose sanctions at this time, but Plaintiff is  cautioned that \nhe faces a substantial risk of sanctions if he continues to use artificial intelligence without carefully  \nverif ying all citations . \n2. Summary Judgment  Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 8 of 169 \n Plaintiff seeks  summary judgment on his  “wrong termination and retaliation” claims , but \nhis legal argument regarding the basis for summary judgment—consisting only of conclusory \nstatements relying on Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 as the sole “Legal Justification” untethered to any of his \nthree specific claims —is not clear.   See Dkt. No. 88 at 1-4, 5, 9, 12.  Although courts give special \nleniency to pro se plaintiffs and construe their papers “liberally and interpret them to raise the \nstrongest arguments that they suggest ,” Jorgensen , 351 F.3d at 50, Plaintiff’s conclusory assertions \nare insufficient,  see id. (“application of this different standard does not relieve plaintiff of his duty \nto meet the requirements necessary to defeat a motion for summary judgment.”).   \nAs for Plaintiff’s statement of material facts, it does not  set out, in particularity, with \ncitations to the record, the factual basis for summary judgment, and it contains contradictory \nassertions of fact .9   Pl. SUMF; Dkt. No. 87-3.  As a result, the Court cannot determine which facts \ncould support a summary judgment.   \nFor all of these reasons, Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment is denied.   B. Defendant’s Cross -Motion for Summary Judgment \n1. Preclusion\n10 \nDefendant argues that  collateral estoppel bars Plaintiff’s claims because the New York \nSupreme Court of Jefferson County affirmed the NYSDHR No Probable Cause Determination for \n \n9 For example, Plaintiff referred to  a “police report against Domino’s management for harassment,” \nPl. SUMF at 3,  but the report involved a complaint about  vandalism and statements about the \n“possibility of slashing [Plaintiff’s]  vehicle’s tires ,” Dkt. No. 87- 4 at 60; Plaintiff stated that he \nwas “wrongfully terminated from employment with Defendant due to filing an ethics complaint \nand reporting a carjacking incident to law enforcement,” Dkt. No. 80 at 7 -8, but Plaintiff offered \nno evidence of  an ethics complaint , and the police report did not mention carjacking , Dkt. No. 87-\n4 at 60; Plaintiff  stated that he was “denied the right to work his scheduled shift on October 29, \n2021,” Pl. SUMF at 3, but Plaintiff voluntarily resigned to accept another position that began  on \nNovember 1, 2021, Pl. Dep. at 5, 33. \n \n10 Much of this section comes from Chief Judge Sannes’s thoughtful analysis of the issue in her \ndecision on the motion to dismiss.  Dkt. No. 43 at 7-9. Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 9 of 1610 \n his claims.  Fat Dough Memorandum of Law (Def. MOL), Dkt. No. 84- 15 at 7- 9.  Plaintiff does \nnot respond to this argument. \n“The federal full faith and credit statute provides, in relevant part, that the ‘judicial \nproceedings of any court of any . . . State . . . shall have the same full faith and credit in every court \nwithin the United States . . . as they have by law or usage  in the courts of such State . . . from which \nthey are taken.’” Lawtone -Bowles v. City of New York , 22 F. Supp. 3d 341 , 348 (S.D.N.Y . 2014) \n(quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1738).  “Under the full faith and credit statute, ‘a federal court must give to \na state- court j udgment the same preclusive effect as would be given that judgment under the law \nof the State in which the judgment was rendered.’” Id. (quoting Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. \nBd. of Educ., 465 U.S. 75, 81 (1984)).   \n“The doctrine of collateral estoppel —also known as issue preclusion—prohibits a party \nfrom re -litigating an issue in certain circumstances.  Under New York law, collateral estoppel bars \nclaims where ‘(1) the issue in question was actually and necessarily decided in a prior proceeding, \nand (2) the party against whom the doctrine is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue i n the first proceeding.’” Lawtone -Bowles , 22 F. Supp. 3d at 348 (quoting Colon v. \nCoughlin, 58 F.3d 865, 869 (2d Ci r. 1995), abrogated on other grounds by Tangreti v. Bachmann, \n983 F.3d 609 (2d Cir. 20 20)).  \nFurthe r, “a state court affirmation of a state administrative determination is entitled to \npreclusive effect in federal court, so long as the state’s administrative proceedings satisfy the minimum requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”   Lewis v. Health \n& Hosps. Corp., No. 11- cv-99, 2013 WL 2351798, at *4 (S.D.N.Y . May 31, 2013) (citing Kremer \nv. Chem. Constr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 481–82 (1982)) .  A NYSDHR “determination finding no \nprobable cause and dismissing a complaint, coupled with a state court judgment affirming the Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 10 of 1611 \n administrative determination, preclude[s] further litigation of federal claims arising from the same \nfacts resolved by the prior proceedings.” Id.  (citing Kremer , 456 U.S. at 485).  However, a \nNYSDHR determination by itself, without state court involvement, is not enough to create preclusive effect.  See Lawtone -Bowles , 22 F. Supp. 3d at 348 n.7 (S.D.N.Y . 2014) (explaining that \na NYSDHR proceeding cannot by itself have preclusive effect “because [28 U.S.C.] § 1738 applies to the judgments of state courts, not state administrative agencies, and the [NY]SDHR’s \ndetermination in this case was not judicially reviewed” (citations omitted)) .   \nHere, the NYSDHR issued a No Probable Cause Determination to Plaintiff after he filed a \ncharge with the agency.  Dkt. No. 84- 7 at 2 -4.   As to the Jefferson County Supreme Court action, \nDefendant provided (1) the petition  Plaintiff filed in the New York Supreme Court in Jefferson \nCounty , Dkt. No. 84- 8, and (2) the docket showing that (a) the case was closed, (b) the “decision \ntype” was  a “long form order ;” and (c) Plaintiff’s request was denied , Dkt. No. 84- 9 at 3.  This is \nnot a sufficient basis to determine what issues and facts were litigated in that proceeding.   Without the long form order itself, it is not clear whether : (1) the state court reached the merits of the \nNYSDHR determination; (2) the NYSDHR determination was  “actually and necessarily decided ,” \nLawtone -Bowles , 22 F. Supp. 3d at 348 (quotation omitted); or  (3) the state court case was \ndismissed with or without prejudice.  Defendant’s motion for summary judgment on this basis is therefore denied . \n2. ADA Retaliation  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff voluntarily resigned and “therefore did not suffer an adverse \nemployment action” as required for an ADA retaliation claim.  Def. MOL at 14- 15.  Plaintiff \nappears to take the position that he was constructive ly discharge d, Dkt. No. 87- 3 at 4 -5, but he also \nargues repeatedly that he was terminated.  Dkt. Nos. 80 at 4, 7;  88 at 2, 3, 7, 9, 12, 19, 21, 23, 25. Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 11 of 1612 \n To state a prima facie case of retaliation, Plaintiff must allege that “ (1) he engaged in an \nactivity protected by the ADA; (2) the employer was aware of this activity; (3) the employer took \nadverse employment action against him ; and (4) a causal connection exists between the alleged \nadverse action and the protected activity.”  Treglia v. Town of Manlius , 313 F.3d 713, 719 (2d Cir. \n2002).   \n “The standard for constructive discharge is whether ‘ working conditions [became] so \nintolerable that a reasonable person in the employee ’s position would have felt compelled to \nresign.’ ”  Aspilaire v. Wyeth Pharms., Inc., 612 F. Supp. 2d 289, 311 (S.D.N.Y . 2009)  (quoting Pa. \nState Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 141  (2004) ).  “‘Constructive discharge occurs when an \nemployer deliberately makes an employee’ s working conditions so intolerable that the employee \nis forced into an involuntary resignation.’ ”  Id. at 311 -12 (quoting Kader v. Paper Software, Inc., \n111 F.3d 337, 339 (2d Cir. 1997) ).  A plaintiff alleging constructive discharge must demonstrate  \nthat “the employer’s actions were deliberate and not merely negligent or ineffective.”  Petrosino \nv. Bell Atl. , 385 F.3d 210, 230 (2d Cir. 2004)  (quotation omitted) .  The standard for “intolerable” \nworking conditions is a higher bar than that for a hostile work environment claim.  See  Ferraro v. \nKellwood Co., No. 03- cv-8492, 2004 WL 2646619, at *7 (S.D.N.Y . Nov. 18, 2004) ( “Constructive \ndischarge can be seen as an aggravated case of hostile work environment.”) . \nHere, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, he cannot establish \nan adverse employment action.  As Plaintiff admits, Defendant did not reduce his salary or change his job title, Dkt. No. 87- 3 at ¶¶ 12 -13 (p. 6).   After Plainti ff resigned from his employment with \nDefendant, a supervisor told him that his position remained open and that he was welcome to return.  Def. SUMF ¶ 45 -48; Pl. Dep. at 32- 33 (supervisor “ had insinuated that he wanted me to \nstay, he didn’t want me to leave  and didn’t want me to quit . . . .  He said that I would be welcome Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 12 of 1613 \n back.”);  87-3 ¶ 45 (p. 31) (admitting that the resignation was initiated by Plaintiff, but asserting \nthat it was coerced).  \nAs to Plaintiff’s constructive discharge argument,  even viewing the evidence in the light \nmost favorable to Plaintiff, there is insufficient evidence to support constructive discharge.  \nPlaintiff admits that his supervisor was disappointed that Plaintiff was leaving and told Plaintiff that his position would remain open if Plaintiff wished to return.   Pl. Dep. at 32- 33.  Even assuming \nthat an employee threw dirty water and mushrooms at him, an employee drew a “smiley face” with \npizza grease on his windshield, and employees talked about slashing Plaintiff’s tires, these conditions  are not  objectively intolerable and, even if they were, there is no evidence that \nPlaintiff’s supervisors deliberately caused those issues.   \nGiven the lack of evidence of an adverse employment action, Defendant’s motion for \nsummary judgment on Plaintiff’s ADA retaliation claim is granted.   \n3.  Title VII Sexual Harassment  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff’s generic allegations were not sufficiently pervasive to \ncreate a hostile work environment, and there is no evidence that any actions were taken on the basis of Plaintiff’s sex.  Def. MOL at 1 -12.  Plaintiff, who identifies as nonbinary, argues that he \nwas subject ed to a “hostile work environment.”   Dkt. No. 88 at 31.   \nSexual harassment under Title VII can be alleged either under a “quid pro quo” theory or \na “hostile work environment” theory.  To allege Title VII harassment under a hostile work \nenvironment theory, “a plaintiff must plead facts that would tend to show that the complained \nconduct: (1) is objectively severe or pervasive —that is , . . . creates an environment that a \nreasonable person would find hostile or abusive; (2) creates an environment that the plaintiff \nsubjectively perceives as hostile or abusive; and ( 3) creates such an  environment because of the Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 13 of 1614 \n plaintiff’s sex.”  Barton  v. Warren Cty., No. 119- cv-1061 (GTS), 2020 WL  4569465 at *8  \n(N.D.N.Y . Aug. 7, 2020)  (quoting Patane v. Clark , 508 F.3d 106, 113 (2d Cir. 2007)).  “To satisfy \nthis standard, a plaintiff must ‘produce enough evidence to show that the workplace [was] \npermeated  with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult, that [was] sufficiently severe or \npervasive to  alter the conditions of the victim’s employment.’” Andersen v. Rochester City Sch. \nDist. , 481 F. App’x 628, 630 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., 596 F.3d \n93, 102 (2d Cir. 2010)).   \nTo determine whether conduct is “severe or  pervasive,” courts  review “the totality of the \ncircumstances, including ‘ the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is \nphysically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably \ninterferes with an employee’ s work performance. ’”  McGullam v. Cedar Graphics, Inc., 609 F.3d \n70, 79 (2d Cir. 2010)  (quoting Harris  v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 23 (1993)).  The “severe \nor pervasive” standard is diffi cult to meet.  See Davis v. Verizon Wireless , 389 F. Supp. 2d 458, \n475-77 (W.D.N.Y . 2005)  (granting summary judgment for the employer because the evidence was \ninsufficient to establish a hostile work environment where the employee was sexually propositioned twice and, after rejecting the advances, shunned by her co -workers); Dall v. St. \nCatherine of Siena Med. Ctr., 966 F. Supp. 2d 167, 190 (E.D.N.Y . 2013) (no hostile work environment when employees “spoke frequently about their sex lives and showed explicit photographs in the workplace, crea ting an uncomfortable and inappropriate work environment”) ; \nAlfano v. Costello, 294 F.3d 365, 380- 81 (2d Cir. 2002)  (same where allegations included four \nsexually inappropriate comments/conduct combined with eight examples of sex- based disparate \ntreatment over a five -year span ); id. at 379 (collecting cases from other circuit s where the evidence \nwas insufficient to establish a hostile work environment ).  Furthermore, i f the conduct occurs over Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 14 of 1615 \n a brief period of time, it is  unlikely to be considered “severe or pervasive.”  See  Ford v. N.Y.C. \nDep’t of Health & Mental Hygiene, 545 F. Supp. 2d 377, 393 (S.D.N.Y . 2008) ( “while [the plaintiff] \nwas subjected to unkind comments on a daily basis, the comments continued for only four \nmonths ,” and concluding that for this and other reasons, “no reasonable jury could find that the \nalleged misconduct was so severe or pervasive as to be objectively hostile or abusive” ). \nHere, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, during his \napproximately 20- day employment, a supervisor told him that soldiers may request oral sex from \nhim, an employee  threw dirty water and mushrooms  at him once, an employee drew a “smiley \nface” on his windshield with pizza grease, and employees allegedly discussed slashing his tires.  \nAlthough this is inappropriate behavior, it is not sufficient for Plaintiff to establish the severe and \npervasive environment required for hostile work envi ronment claim.  Furthermore, Plaintiff cannot \nestablish that any of these action s were connected to Plaintiff’s sexual identity or expression.  \nAccordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary judgment is granted as to Plaintiff’s Title VII \nharassment claim.  \n4. Title VII Retaliation  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiff voluntarily resigned , and there is no adverse employment \naction to support a retaliation claim.  Def. MOL  at 13 -15.  Plaintiff a rgues that he was terminated \n“shortly after filing a complaint regarding discriminatory practices, a protected activity under federal law .”  Dkt. No. 88 at 2.   \n“To make out a prima facie  case for Title VII retaliation, a plaintiff must show 1) \nparticipation in a protected activity; 2) the defendant ’s knowledge of the protected activity; 3) an \nadverse employment action; and 4) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.”   Dotson v. City of Syracuse , 688 F. App’ x 69, 72 (2d Cir. 2017)  Case 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 15 of 1616 \n (quoting Jute v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., 420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir. 2005)  (additional quotation \nomitted ) (cleaned up) ).  \nHere, for the reasons articulated above, there is no adverse employment action because \nPlaintiff resigned, and even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiff,  there is \nnot sufficient evidence of  constructive discharge.  Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for summary \njudgment on Plaintiff’s Title VII retaliation claim is  granted . \nIV. Conclusion  \nFor these reasons, it is hereby  \nORDERED that Plaintiff’s motions for sanctions and summary judgment under Rule 56, \nDkt. Nos. 80, 88, are DENIED, and it is further  \nORDERED that Defendant’s motion for summary judgment under Rule 56, Dkt. No.84, \nis GRANTED, and it is further  \nORDERED that the Clerk of the Court is directed to enter judgment accordingly and close \nthis action.    \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  September 1 7, 2025 \n \nCase 5:22-cv-00761-ECC-ML     Document 112     Filed 09/17/25     Page 16 of 16",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Rene Zelt et al. v. Xytex Corporation et al., the plaintiffs, Rene and Trayce Zelt, claimed against the defendants for wrongful birth after discovering their sperm donor's misrepresented education and mental health history. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, ruling the plaintiffs' claims as equivalent to a wrongful birth action, which is not recognized under Georgia law. This case involves AI as the donor falsely claimed he was working toward a Ph.D. in artificial intelligence, though this misrepresentation was not central to the court's decision.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs' claims against Xytex Corporation constitute a wrongful birth action, which is not permissible under Georgia law, or a wrongful conception action.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the claims by the plaintiffs were indeed for wrongful birth, as they involved the assertion that the plaintiffs’ children would not have been born had they known about the donor’s true history. Since Georgia law does not recognize wrongful birth claims, the motion to dismiss was granted.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you bought seeds from a store because the label said they were from a special, really smart plant. But later, you found out that information was wrong, and the seeds were just ordinary. You sue the store, saying that if you had known the truth, you wouldn't have bought those seeds. The court says you can't sue over this because, in Georgia, you're not allowed to sue for things like \"I wish my plant had never grown.\" In this case, parents found out the donor had lied about his background and mental health after their children were born, but the court ruled you can't blame the sperm bank for your kids being born if you think you wouldn't have had them otherwise.",

Background\nThe Plaintiffs Rene Zelt and Trayce Zelt reside in Texas and have two\nchildren, A.Z. and B.Z., who were bo th conceived by means of artificial\ninsemination with semen purchased from the Defendant Xytex Corporation.1\nThe Defendant Xytex Corporation is a fo r-profit sperm bank with its principal\nplace of business in Georgia.2 It is a subsidiary of the Defendant Xytex Cryo\n1Compl. ¶ 1.\n2Id. ¶ 2.\nT:\\ORDERS\\17\\Zelt\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:17-cv-04851-TWT   Document 17   Filed 02/22/18   Page 1 of 10International LTD.3 The individual Defendants were associated with the Atlanta\noffice of Xytex in various ways.4\nOn October 18, 2000, James Aggeles applied to be a sperm donor with\nXytex.5 On his application, Aggeles claimed that he had a Bachelor’s Degree, a\nMaster’s Degree, and that he was wo rking toward his Ph.D. in artificial\nintelligence.6 None of this was true, however, as Aggeles had actually dropped\nout of school at that time.7 Prior to applying to be a sperm donor, Aggeles had\nalso been hospitalized and diagnosed wi th psychotic schizophrenia, narcissistic\npersonality disorder, and significant grandiose delusions.8 But during Aggeles’s\nfirst visit to Xytex, the Defendant Hart ley suggested to him that more educated\ndonors did better selling their sperm.9 As a result, Aggeles filled out his\napplication falsely by inflating his ed ucational background and lying about his\nmental health history.10\nDespite Xytex’s claim that all applicants went through a rigorous\n3Id. ¶ 3.\n4Id. ¶¶ 4-8.\n5Id. ¶ 12.\n6Id. ¶ 13.\n7Id. ¶ 21.\n8Id. ¶¶ 20-21.\n9Id. ¶ 21.\n10Id. \n-2- T:\\ORDERS\\17\\Zelt\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:17-cv-04851-TWT   Document 17   Filed 02/22/18   Page 2 of 10qualification procedure that takes mont hs to complete, including a medical\nreview and regular updates to their medi cal and criminal histories, Aggeles was\napproved as a donor within two weeks.11 Xytex presented this false information\nto its customers through Aggeles’s public profile.12 The Complaint alleges that\nAggeles was only given a ten minute physical examination, during which nophysical or mental health history was discussed.\n13 After Aggeles was approved\nas a sperm donor, he was hospitaliz ed numerous times for mental health\nreasons, and was arrested on numerous occasions.14 Between 2000 and 2016,\nAggeles became one of Xytex’s most popular donors.15 Families often desired the\nsperm of highly educated and accomplished people, and Xytex promoted Aggelesas such a donor based upon the information in his application. During thoseyears, Aggeles became the biological father of at least thirty-six childrenthrough Xytex’s sale of his sperm, including the Plaintiffs’ two children.\n16\nThe Plaintiffs, a same-sex couple, decided in early 2006 to conceive\nchildren through artificial insemination.17 They discovered Xytex’s website after\n11Id. ¶¶ 18, 22.\n12Id. ¶ 13.\n13Id. ¶ 22.\n14Id. ¶ 23.\n15Id. ¶ 24.\n16Id.\n17Id. ¶ 29.\n-3- T:\\ORDERS\\17\\Zelt\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:17-cv-04851-TWT   Document 17   Filed 02/22/18   Page 3 of 10researching online.18 The Plaintiffs sought to find a sperm donor with verified\nmedical, physical, and personality attributes that complemented their ownattributes.\n19 While conducting research, the Plai ntiffs were impressed by Xytex’s\nsperm donor qualification procedures.20 When the Plaintiffs reached out to Xytex\nby phone, Xytex’s represen tatives told them that Aggeles was a very popular\ndonor, and that his sperm was rarely available.21 A s  a  r e s u l t  o f  X y t e x ’ s\nrepresentations, the Plaintiffs purchased Aggeles’s sperm.22 Using Aggeles’s\nsperm, the Plaintiff Rene Zelt gave birth to A.Z. on March 17, 2007, and thengave birth to B.Z. on December 11, 2009.\n23\nIn December 2015, the Plaintiffs conducted an internet search of their\ndonor, and discovered, through public ly-accessible documents, that most of\nXytex’s representations concerning Aggeles were not true.24 The Plaintiffs\nlearned that Aggeles had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, that he haddropped out of college, and that he had pleaded guilty to residential burglary.\n25\n18Id. ¶ 29.\n19Id.\n20Id.\n21Id.\n22Id.\n23Id. ¶ 31. \n24Id. ¶ 32.\n25Id. ¶ 33.\n-4- T:\\ORDERS\\17\\Zelt\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:17-cv-04851-TWT   Document 17   Filed 02/22/18   Page 4 of 10They also learned that the photographs on  his public profile had been altered to\nremove a large facial mole.26 All of the information about Aggeles’s educational\nand criminal history was easily accessible through a simple internet search.27\nAs a result, the Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on November 30, 2017, alleging\nthirteen different causes of action against the Defendants, including fraud,negligence, and breach of warranty.\n28 The Defendants now move to dismiss the\nComplaint for failure to state a claim.\nII. Legal Standard\nA complaint should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) only where it\nappears that the facts alleged fail to state a “plausible” claim for relief.29 A\ncomplaint may survive a motion to dismi ss for failure to state a claim, however,\neven if it is “improbable” that a plainti ff would be able to prove those facts; even\nif the possibility of recovery is extremely “remote and unlikely.”30 In ruling on\na motion to dismiss, the court must a ccept the facts pleaded in the complaint as\n26Id.\n27Id. \n28This action is one of numerous ca ses arising out of Xytex’s sale of\nAggeles’s semen. This Court has previously presided over, and dismissed, twosimilar cases against these Defendants. \nSee Doe 1 v. Xytex Corp. , 1:16-CV-1453-\nTWT; Doe v. Xytex Corp. , 1:16-CV-1729-TWT.\n29Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009); F ED. R. CIV. P.\n12(b)(6). \n30Bell Atlantic v.

Discussion\nThe Defendants’ primary argument is th at all of the Plaintiffs’ claims are\nderivative of a wrongful birth action, an d because wrongful birth claims are not\nrecognized in Georgia, the Plaint iffs’ claims must be dismissed.33 In other words,\nthe Defendants argue that all of the Plaintiffs’ claims fundamentally stand onthe assertion that if the Plaintiffs had known the truth about Aggeles, thePlaintiffs’ two children would not have b een born. The Plaintiffs, for their part,\nargue that this case is not one for wrongful \nbirth , but rather for wrongful\nconception .34\nIn Georgia, wrongful conception cl aims generally arise when a steriliza-\n31See Quality Foods de Centro America, S.A. v. Latin American\nAgribusiness Dev. Corp., S.A. , 711 F.2d 989, 994-95 (11th Cir. 1983); see also\nSanjuan v. American Bd. of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc. , 40 F.3d 247, 251\n(7th Cir. 1994) (noting that at the pleading stage, the plaintiff “receives thebenefit of imagination”). \n32See Lombard’s, Inc. v. Prince Mfg., Inc. , 753 F.2d 974, 975 (11th\nCir. 1985), cert. denied , 474 U.S. 1082 (1986).\n33Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, at 5-8.\n34Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, at 5.\n-6- T:\\ORDERS\\17\\Zelt\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:17-cv-04851-TWT   Document 17   Filed 02/22/18   Page 6 of 10tion or abortion procedure goes wrong and a live birth unintentionally results.35\nIn such a case, the measure of damages allows “recovery of expenses for the\nunsuccessful medical procedure which led to conception or pregnancy, for pain\nand suffering, medical complications, costs of delivery, lost wages, and loss ofconsortium.”\n36 By contrast, wrongful birth claims normally arise when the\nparents contend they would have aborted the child if they had been fully aware\nof the child’s condition.37 While wrongful conception claims have been allowed\nin Georgia, wrongful birth claims have not.38 The Plaintiffs argue that the\nfunctional differences between these two to rts are (1) the timing of the tort (i.e.,\npre- or post-conception), and (2) whether a defendant’s actions directly orindirectly caused the injury. According to the Plaintiffs, when the wrong occurs\nbefore conception and directly causes the harm, as in failed sterilization cases,\nthe tort is allowed.\n39 And when the wrong occurs after conception and indirectly\ncauses the harm, as in failure-to-diag nose cases, the tort is disallowed.\n35Fulton-DeKalb Hosp.

The reason why Georgia courts have looked\non wrongful birth claims with disfavor is  not because of the timing of the tort or\nthe causal link between the defendant and the harm.  The true difference\nbetween the two torts is the measure of  damages. Wrongful birth claims are\ndisfavored because they require the court to decide between the value of a lifewith disabilities and the value of no life at all. The Georgia courts are “unwilling\nto say that life, even life with severe impairments, may ever amount to a legal\ninjury.”\n40 In this case, the Plaintiffs essentially claim that had the Defendants\nbeen truthful with them about Aggeles’s history, they would not have used his\nsperm and their children would not have been born. \nThe Plaintiffs also contend that this action is not one for wrongful birth\nbecause the relevant comparison for damage s in this case is not between a child\nbeing born with a hereditary predisposi tion for mental illness, and nonexistence\nof the child.41 The Plaintiffs argue that, inst ead, the relevant comparison is\nbetween the conception  of a child with Aggeles as the father, and conception ofa child from a donor who had been appropriately screened.\n42 However, this\ncomparison still asks the Court to decide between the value of a child’s life with\nAggeles as the father (and all of the resulting hereditary problems), and the\n40Abelson , 260 Ga. at 715.\n41Pls.’ Br. in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, at 12.\n42Id.\n-8- T:\\ORDERS\\17\\Zelt\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:17-cv-04851-TWT   Document 17   Filed 02/22/18   Page 8 of 10value of a child’s life with a different  donor as the father (without these\nproblems). And, the Plaintiffs, through this comparison, admit that they would\nnot have had their children had they kn own about Aggeles’s history. These are\nthe exact reasons that Georgia does not recognize an action for wrongful birth.\nFinally, the Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants ask this Court to create\na broad, new “immunity” from liability for negligent and reckless sperm banks,\nand that “[j]udicial creation of such i mmunity would usurp legislative power.”43\nHowever, exactly the opposite is true. The Plaintiffs ask this Court to allow a\ncause of action that the legislature ha s never recognized, and which the Georgia\nSupreme Court has explicitly rejected. This Court would “usurp legislativepower” by doing so. The legislature, and not this Court, is the proper forum for\naddressing the allegedly negligent or re ckless failure of sperm banks to screen\nsperm donors.\n44\nIV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania dismissed Jason L. Brown's claims against Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO) and the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) for discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981. Brown alleged racial discrimination and cited various incidents, including unauthorized artificial intelligence use, but the court found his complaints lacked sufficient factual support. \n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's allegations of discrimination, retaliation, and hostile work environment are sufficient to state a plausible claim for relief under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1981.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiff failed to state any plausible claims for discrimination, retaliation, or hostile work environment as his allegations were conclusory and insufficient to infer liability under the applicable legal standards.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone named Jason feels he's being treated unfairly at work because of his race. He tells the court that things like being asked to put a sticker on his ID and receiving certain emails are proof of this unfair treatment. The court looked at his claims and said they just weren’t strong enough; they didn't show clear evidence that his race led to unfair treatment. Therefore, the court said, “We can't continue with this case because you haven't shown enough to prove your point.”",

BROWN,           \nPlaintiff,  \n \n                       v.  \nPORT AUTHORITY TRANSIT CORPORATION, et al.,  \nDefendants.  : \n: \n: \n: \n: \n: \n:  : \n  \nCIVIL ACTION  NO. 22- 3199 \n  \nMEMORANDUM  \nYounge, J.           July 24, 2023  \n \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff Jason L. Brown, a custodial employee, has filed this civil action against his \nemployer, the Port Authority Transportation Company (hereinafter, “PATCO”) —a wholly- owned \nsubsidiary of the Delaware River Port Authority (hereinafter, “DRPA”) —in conne ction with \nalleged discrimination by Plaintiff’s employer on the basis of Plaintiff’s race. (Third Amended \nComplaint (hereinafter, “TAC”), p. 2, ECF No. 33; Mot. to Dis., p. 6, ECF No. 35.)  Although \nPlaintiff’s claims are not entirely clear, they appear to relate to Defendants’ (1) discrimination on the basis of Plaintiff’s race, (2) retaliation against Plaintiff, and (3) creation of a hostile work environment. (TAC, pp. 3- 14, ECF No. 33.)  Plaintiff’s claims are brought under Title VII of the \nCivil Rights  Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e2- 3, and Plaintiff seeks damages under 42 U.S.C. § \n1981a. (TAC, pp. 1- 2, ECF No. 33.)  Plaintiff seeks $800,000 in damages for three claims against \nPATCO , $600,000 in damages for one claim against DRPA , and $500,000 in damage s for one \nclaim against both PATCO and DRPA . (TAC, pp. 3- 14, ECF No. 33.)  Currently before this Court \nis Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, wherein Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s pleadings have failed to allege sufficient facts to support a ny Title VII cla im. (Mot. to Dis., p. 6, ECF No. 35.)   This \nCourt will also consider Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (Mot. for J. on P., ECF Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 1 of 14 2  \n No. 36) and Defendants’ Response to Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings . (Resp., \nECF No. 37.)   \nII. LEGAL  STANDARD: 12(b)(6) MOTION TO DISMISS  \nIn Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662 (2009), the U.S.  Supreme Court considered in detail the \nproper standard for a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  As the Third Circu it has instructed in line with the Supreme Court’s decision in Iqbal , \n“[t]o survive dismissal, ‘a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \nstate a claim to relief that is plausible  on its face.’”  Tatis v. Allied Interstate , LLC , 882 F.3d 422, \n426 (3d Cir. 2018) (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quotation and citation omitted)).  For a claim \nto be “plausible on its face,” it must “plead[] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that th e defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at \n678 (citing  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)).  This Court must thus examine \nPlaintiff’s claims to determine whether it can infer that Defendants  could be held liable  for the \nalleged misconduct.  \nIII. DISCUSSION: 12(b)(6) MOTION TO DISMISS  \nAs previously discussed, Plaintiff appears to assert three claims against Defendants: (1) \ndiscrimination on the basis of Plaintiff’s race, (2) retaliation against Plaintiff, and (3) creation of a \nhostile work environment.  This Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff’s various causes of action against Defendants are difficult to decipher and organize —not to mention the challenge of \nmapping Plaintiff’s allegations onto the various elements of each claim.  Therefore, this Court will \ngrant Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim.  Furthermore, Plaintiff has had \nfour opportunities over the course of approximately nine months to allege facts in his complaint \nthat would support the elements of each of his claims —the initial Complaint (ECF No. 1) and three Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 2 of 14 3  \n Amended Complaints (ECF No. 13, ECF No. 19, ECF No. 33) .  As Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss \naccurately states, “the TAC does not cure the issu es raised relating to any of its predecessors ,” and \ninstead is “largely a reiteration of counts [Plaintiff] asserted in his previous complaints.” (Mot. to \nDis., p. 6, ECF No. 35.)  Accordingly, this Court will dismiss Plaintiff’s claims with prejudice, as \nPlaintiff has been granted ample opportunit y to allege grounds for relief , yet  Plaintiff has \nrepeatedly fallen short of the standard set by Iqbal , as this Court’s analysis below reveals .  \nA. Title VII Racial Discrimination Claim  \n1. Stated Allegations  \nAgainst Def endant PATCO , Plaintiff generally alleges that Defendant “used work practices \nthat were discriminatory towards my color.” (TAC, p. 3, ECF No. 33.)  Namely, Plaintiff alleges \nthat while working for Defendant PATCO , his employee identification card at one point did not \nwork ; when Defendant then requested  that Plaintiff place a sticker on his new identification card, \nthis caused Plaintiff “ emotional distress and mental anguish.”  (TAC, p. 4, ECF No. 33.)   In \nPlaintiff’s words, this incident and the harm again st him can be summarized as follows:  \nI had already faced the inconvenience of having the conditions of my \nemployment discriminated upon when my id card became restricted to not working at the timeclock to record and track my daily work schedule production. To then not have my identity placed on my new id card is unwelcoming, but to expect me to put my identity on there by sticker is even more of an unwelcoming behavior and harassment towards my color as an individual within my job description.  \n \n(TAC, p. 5, ECF No. 33.)  Also against Defendant PATCO, Plaintiff claims  that Defendant \ndiscriminates on the basis of race in allocating specific assignments on the work floor  to one \nindividual rather than rotating assignments.  As Plaintiff puts it, “ [b]ecause manag ement could \nprove that my coworkers had a discrepancy about how job assignment had shifted to one person, Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 3 of 14 4  \n instead of a rotation, there is evidence that race and color discrimination is present in the work \nenvironment.”  (TAC, p. 10, ECF No. 33.)  \nAgainst Def endant DRPA, Plaintiff points to Defendant’s display of  Plaintiff’s  personal e -\nmail on a physical mail correspondence  as an instance of “classif[ying] my employment by my \ncolor .” (TAC, p. 12, ECF No. 33; Compl., p. 27, ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiff appears to connect this \nincident to communications he had with management of PATCO and DRPA  about unspecified \n“situations” and “the work environment” more generally. (TAC, pp. 11- 12, ECF No. 33; Compl., \npp. 17-19, ECF No. 1. )  In Plaintiff’s view , the display of his personal email on a mail \ncommunication was “harassing” and allegedly  “inflict[ed]  emotional distress ,” constituting \n“intentional interference being directed toward me and my color.” (TAC, p. 12, ECF No. 33.)  \nAgainst both PATCO and DRPA , Plaintiff alleges generally that “[c]olor and race are being \nused to systemically repress employment and create a sense of deflection towards equal \nopportunity in the workplace.” (TAC, p. 13, ECF No. 33.)  This is seen in shutdowns of employee databases,  limited opportunities for educational training, and Defendants’  use of “an unauthorized \nartificial intelligence” in communications . (TAC, p. 13, ECF No. 33.)  Plaintiff claims that  “color \nwas reflected” in these occurrences , making the work environment “discriminatory .” (TAC, pp. \n13-14, ECF No. 33.)  \n2. Legal Standard : Title VII Employment Discrimination  \nTitle VII prohibits employment discrimination based on an individual’s race, color, \nreligion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e -2.  But the mere allegation that discrimination \nagainst an individual has occurred due to their race does not make it t rue; Plaintiff must plead more \nthan “mere conclusory statements” to survive a motion to dismiss. Iqbal  556 U.S. at 663 (citing \nTwombly , 550 U.S. at 555) .  In the Title VII context, the U.S. Supreme Court has instructed that Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 4 of 14 5  \n “the ordinary rules for assessing the sufficiency of a complaint apply” at the motion to dismiss \nstage. Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A. , 534 U.S. 506, 511 (2002). In other words , the standard \narticulated in Iqbal  applies here, not the McDonnell Douglas  burden- shifting framework , because \nthis case is at the motion to dismiss stage —not the motion for summary judgment stage . See \nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973);  Green v. McDonnell -Douglas Corp., \n381 F.Supp. 846 (E.D. Mo. 1970) .  Accordingly, for Plaintiff to survive Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss, Plaintiff ’s claim, accepted as true, must be “plausible on its face; ” it must “plead[] factual \ncontent that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misco nduct alleged.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570).  Stated differently, \nPlaintiff must plead facts show ing that : “(1) s/he is a member of a protected class; (2) s/he was \nqualified for the position s/he sought to attain or retain; (3)  s/he suffered an adverse employment \naction; and (4) the action occurred under circumstances that could give rise to an inference of \nintentional discrimination .” Makky v.  Chertoff , 541 F.3d 205, 214 (3d Cir. 2008).    \n3. Plaintiff ’s Claim is not “Plausible on its Face” \nPlaintiff ’s claim is not plausible on its face because Plaintiff’s allegations, even if taken as \ntrue, would not permit this Court to “draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for \nthe misconduct alleged.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570).  Defendant \nPATCO ’s request that Plaintiff place a sticker on a replacement employee identification card  \nappears to be part of Defendant’s general practice of employee recordkeeping and security .  This \nis con firmed by a review of “Exhibits A -1, A-2, and A -3”—documents Plaintiff attached to \nPlaintiff’s original Complaint—which Plaintiff cites in Plaintiff’s Third Amended Complaint; \nthese communications reveal that Plaintiff’s identification card malfunctioned a nd, as a result,  was \npromptly and professionally replaced. ( Compl., pp. 11 -19, ECF No. 1; TAC, pp. 3-6, ECF No. 33.)  Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 5 of 14 6  \n Even taking Plaintiff’s claim as true that Plaintiff “fel[t] a sense of harassment” at being asked to \nplace a sticker on his replacement identification card, this affective response alone is insufficient \nto permit this Court to reasonably infer that Defendant PATCO is liable under Title VII. (TAC, p. 4, ECF No. 33.)  \nSimilarly, Defendant PATCO’s decision to assign certain work to one individual —to \nPlaintiff —rather than assign work on a rotation  also does not permit this Court to reasonably infer \nthat PATCO is liable for any alleged misconduct .  As the Third C ircuit has instructed, a pleadin g \nthat only “a single member of the non- protected class” was treated more favorably than a member \nof Plaintiff’s protected class  does not necessarily compel a court to find an “inference of \ndiscrimination .” Simpson v. Kay Je welers , 142 F.3d 639, 646 (1998).  But h ere, Plaintiff does not \nallege specifically that  individuals  of one race were preferentially and discriminatorily  granted \nspecific floor assignments over individuals of another race ; in other words, a non- protected  class \nwas not treated more favorably than a protected class  because no non- protected class was involved \nat all .  Instead, Plaintiff asserts that  colleagues of Plaintiff’s own protected class complained to \nmanagement about Plaintiff’s “floor assignment” ( which Plaintiff seemingly concedes was a more \nfavorable or desirable assignment ). (TAC, pp. 9- 11, ECF No. 33.)  Therefore, Plaintiff’s claims —\neven taken as true—do not permit this Court to infer that Plaintiff has been impermissibly discrimina ted against under Title VII .   \nPlaintiff’s allegation against DRPA —that Defendant’s display of Plaintiff’s personal e -mail \non a physical mail correspondence discriminated against Plaintiff’s race —also is insufficient to \npermit this Court to infer the presence of discrimination .  Nowhere on the envelope is Plaintiff’s \nrace even mentioned . (Compl., p. 27, ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiff ’s statement that DRPA’s inclusion of \nthe e- mail address “classified my employment by my color” is “ conclusory ;” accordingly, it does Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 6 of 14 7  \n not allow this court to infer discrimination against Plaintiff’s protected class . Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, \n663; Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 556- 57.  \nLastly, Plaintiff’s allegation against both PATCO and DRPA —that employee databases \nshut down, opportunities for educ ational training were limited, and Defendants used “an \nunauthorized artificial intelligence” in communications —similarly fail to permit this Court to infer \nthe presence of discrimination . (TAC, p. 13, ECF No. 33.)  Like Plaintiff’s pleading that his e -mail \naddress appeared on the outside of an envelope, Plaintiff here also does not explain the nexus \nbetween these commonplace business occurrences and racial discrimination.  Plaintiff does not plead, for instance, that educational trainings were denied to mem bers of Plaintiff’s protected class  \nwhile  the same trainings were granted to members of a non- protected class.  Once again, Plaintiff’s \nconclusory claim that “color is reflected” in these occurrences cannot permit this Court to infer \nthat Defendant impermissibly discriminates on the basis of Plaintiff’s race. (TAC, pp. 13- 14, ECF \nNo. 33.)  Therefore, in sum, because none of Plaintiff’s allegations of illegal discrimination on the \nbasis of race “plead[] factual content that allows the court to draw the reaso nable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,” Plaintiff’s claim is accordingly dismissed. Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.   \nB. Title VII Retaliation Claim  \n1. Stated Allegation s \nPlaintiff’s second Title VII claim is made against PATCO for retaliation.  Plaintiff alleges \nthat, in response to his department director denying Plaintiff ’s enrollment in a course eligible for \ntuition reimbursement, Plaintiff received an “ unnecessary email that reflects unlawful \nclassification of [his] employment and previous deprivation of employment opportunity such as tuition reimbursement.” (TAC, pp. 6- 7, ECF No. 33.)  The email was “retaliatory,” in Plaintiff’s Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 7 of 14 8  \n view, allegedly occurrin g because of the director’s pr ior denial of Plaintiff’s request to participate \nin the tuition reimbursement program ; further, it was “discriminatory because [Plaintiff has] the \noption to learn online .” (TAC, pp, 7- 8, ECF No. 33).  To Plaintiff, it “was a r acial message \nrequesting me to look around in the department and count the total number of blacks that are \ntradesmen.” (TAC, pp. 8- 9, ECF No. 33.)   \nAs evidence of Plaintiff’s denial in the tuition -reimbursed course, Plaintiff cites “Exh. A -\n4” from his ori ginal Complaint. (TAC, p. 9, ECF No. 33.)  This exhibit consists of an email \ncommunication between Plaintiff and an unspecified individual named Tonya M. Little —\npresumably a member of management or human resources. (Compl., p. 21, ECF No. 1.)  Upon Plaintiff’s request that his reimbursement form be approved for his desired course, Little responded by stating that Plaintiff needed additional signatures of approval  from various management \npersonnel, after which she conveyed that “[w]hen I have everyone’s sign ature, I will email the \nform to you with approval. Please keep in mind you cannot start a course until you have the signed approval form back.” (Compl., p. 21, ECF No. 1.)   Furthermore, a prior Exhibit in Plaintiff’s \noriginal Complaint —“Exh. A -3”—contains a written account of an explanation Plaintiff appears \nto have received in response to a previous complaint about this “denial .”  (Compl., p. 19, ECF No. \n1.)  During that conversation, Plaintiff apparently was reminded of the requirements of PATCO’s \ntuition  reimbursement policy , after which Plaintiff “indicated that [he] put the process on hold for \nnow because [he was] planning to move” and “stated that [he was] satisfied with the explanation.” (Compl., p. 19, ECF No. 1.)  \nAs evidence of the retaliatory email  for the above -described “denial ,” Plaintiff cites “Exh. \nA-5” from Plaintiff’s original Complaint. (TAC, p. 7, 9, ECF No. 33.)   Exhibit A -5 appears to be \na welcome email to “the PATCO  Car Status Group,” which elsewhere in Plaintiff’s C omplaint is Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 8 of 14 9  \n described as a “strategic initiative to keep all employees informed as to the working status  of the \ntrain cars and the Equipment Department.”  (Compl., p. 19, 24, ECF No. 1.)   \n2. Legal Standard : Title VII Retaliation  \nTitle VII’s protections against retaliation cover individuals who “opposed any practice \nmade an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII]” and those who “made a charge, testified, \nassisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, o r hearing under [Title \nVII].” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e -3.  Title VII retaliation claims, like Title VII claims alleging \ndiscrimination on the basis of race (see above), are also assessed  at the motion to dismiss stage  \nunder Iqbal , not McDonnell Douglas . Swierkiew icz, 534 U.S. at 511.  Plaintiff must do more than \nplead “mere conclusory statements;” Plaintiff ’s claim must be “plausible on its face” in that it must  \n“plead[] factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant  \nis liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 663, 678.  In other words, Plaintiff must \nplead facts showing that: “(1) [the plaintiff] engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) the employer took an adverse employment action against [the plaintiff]; and (3) there was a causal connection between [the plaintiff ’s] participation in the protected activity and the adverse \nemployment action.” Moore  v. City of Philadelphia, 461 F.3d 331, 340 –41 (3d Cir. 2006), as  \namended (Sept. 13, 2006 ). \n3. It is not “plausible on its face” that Plaintiff participated in a “protected \nactivity” under Title VII.  \nPlaintiff alleges that Plaintiff faced illegal retaliation in the form of an e -mail, which \noccurred  after  Plaintiff’s department director supposedly deni ed Plaintiff’s enrollment in a course \neligible for tuition reimbursement. (TAC, pp. 6- 9, ECF No. 33.)  Plaintiff not only mischaracterizes \nthe facts here, but even if Plaintiff’s characterization s were accurate, such facts would not entitle \nPlaintiff to relief  because Plaintiff did not engage in a “protected activity.” Plaintiff did not Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 9 of 14 10  \n “oppose[] any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [Title VII]” and Plaintiff has not \n“made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an invest igation, proceeding, \nor hearing under [Title VII].”  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -3.  Receiving an email as a result of being denied \ntuition reimbursement is not a plausible ground for relief under Title VII.  Therefore, Plaintiff’s Title VII retaliation claim is dismissed.    \nC. Section 1981 Claim : Creation of a Hostile Work Environment  \n1. Stated Allegations  \nFinally, Plaintiff alleges that PATCO management permitted Plaintiff’s coworkers to create \na hostile work environment , which Plaintiff claims arose “due to coworkers who compromised the \nwork environment about assignment.” (TAC, p. 9, ECF No. 33.)  Specifically, as Plaintiff outlines in his TAC and EEOC Complaint, other coworkers “of similar color and same race [sic]” “complained  to [Plaintiff’s] manager with regard to assignments ,” “inquired as to when the rotation \n[of floor assignments] would restart ,” and “made comments to [Plaintiff] with regard to \n[Plaintiff’s] work ethic ,” such as “you’re doing too much” and “they’re going t o expect the same \nfrom us.” ( TAC, p. 9, ECF No. 33;  Compl., pp. 9- 10, ECF No. 1.)   To Plaintiff, such behavior  \nmeans that “the employer is in violation of [Title VII] because non- management employees are \nrecreating the classification of employees and limit ing the privilege of being assigned to a certain \nassignment .” (TAC, pp. 9- 10, ECF No. 33.)  Such behavior from Plaintiff’s colleagues also \nallegedly constitutes evidence of discrimination by Defendants , in Plaintiff’s view, because \nPlaintiff  “shared with counsel of the defendants a list of names who individuals [sic] who could \nconfirm or deny the allegations set forth in this claim and other claims previously mentioned,” yet Plaintiff remains unaware of any actions taken by Defendants as a result of his int errogatory \nresponses. (TAC, p. 10, ECF No. 33.)  Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 10 of 14 11  \n 2. Legal Standard : Section 1981 Hostile Work Environment Claim  \nAs the Third Circuit has  outlined, the elements of a § 1981 hostile work environment claim \nare as follows: “ 1) the employee suffered intentional discrimination because of his/her [race], 2) \nthe discrimination was severe or pervasive, 3) the discrimination detrimentally affected the \nplaintiff, 4) the discrimination would detrimentally affect a reasonable person in like circumstances, and 5) the existence of respondeat superior  liability [meaning the employer is \nresponsible].”  Castleberry v. STI Grp., 863 F.3d 259, 262 (3d Cir. 2017) (quoting Mandel v. M & \nQ Packaging Corp., 706 F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir. 2013) (citation omit ted)). Under Iqbal , Plaintiff \nmust allege facts that plausibly  show that Plaintiff satisfies each element . 556 U.S. at 678. \n3. Plaintiff’s alleged facts do not plausibly suggest Defendant s are liable for \na hostile work environment under Section 1981. \nTaking the facts alleged by Plaintiff as true, Plaintiff fails to plausibly suggest he can meet \nany of the  first four elements of a hostile work environment claim under § 1981.  Because Plaintiff \ncannot establish that a hostile work environment existed in the first place, this Court declines to address the fifth element of a §  1981 hostile work environment claim —whether the employer is \nliable under respondeat superior .   \nFor the first element, Plaintiff provides no evidence beyond Plaintiff’s own conclusory  \nstatements  that his colleagues’ complaint s were intentionally made because of Plaintiff’s race.   \nInstead, the statements’ contents, as alleged, solely concern ed floor assignments and Plaintiff’s \n“work ethic .” (TAC, p. 9, ECF No. 33; Compl., pp. 9- 10, ECF No. 1.)  To infer that such statements \ntruly concerned Plaintiff’s race would be an impermissible leap of reasoning for this Court.  While \nPlaintiff’s failure to plead facts that plausibly suggest Defendants are liable for the first prong of a hostile work environment is alone sufficient to dismiss Plaintiff’s claim, this Court will \nnevertheless assess Plaintiff’s pleading of the other elements of a hostile work environment claim.    Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 11 of 14 12  \n For the second element, Plaintiff provides no evidence that his colleagues ’ statements —if \nconsidered “discrimination” —were “severe or pervasive.”  Castleberry , 863 F.3d at 262.  When \nassessing whether a hostile work environment is present, “analysis must concentrate not on \nindividual incidents, but on the overall scenario.” Caver  v. City of Trenton, 420 F.3d 243, 262- 63 \n(3d Cir. 2005).  Taken both individually and in their totality, the alleged statements , which solely \nconcerned work assignments and Plaintiff’s work ethic, are not sufficiently severe to establish a \nhostile work environment .  \nFor the  third  element, Plaintiff does not provide evidence beyond conclusory statements \nthat he was “detrimentally affected” by his colleagues’ statements.  Although Plaintiff c laims he \nexperienced “emotional distress and mental anguish”  and describes his colleagues’ statements as \n“evil,” Plaintiff presented no evidence that he suffered any psychological distress , that his ability \nto perform his job was impaired, or that he suffered financially as a result of  the statements . (TAC,  \npp. 9- 11, ECF No. 33.)    \nSimilarly, for  the fourth element, this Court disagrees that a n objectively reasonable person \nin similar circumstances would be offended by the alleged incidents.  As described above, the \nstatements were made by members of the same race as Plaintiff and did not mention Plaintiff’s race at all . (TAC, p. 9, ECF No. 33; Compl., pp. 9 -10, ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiff provides no evidence \nbeyond conclusory statements to suggest that his colleagues’ comments were truly about Plaintiff’s race, and it is not for this Court to find such implications where none have been alleged.  \nIn sum , Plaintiff’s pleadings do not allege sufficient facts to plausibly demonstrate that \nPlaintiff meets each element to establish a hostile work environment under § 1981.  Therefore, \nDefendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s claim of a hostile work environment with respect to Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 12 of 14 13  \n Plaintiff’s race is granted.   All of Plaintiff’s claims are thus dismissed under Defendants’ Rule \n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. \nIV. 12(c) MOTION FOR J UDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS   \nIn response to Defendant s’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, Plaintiff filed a Rule 12(c) \nmotion for judgment on the pleadings.  According to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c) , a party \nmay move for judgment on the pleadings “ [a]fter the pleadings are closed —but early enough not \nto delay trial.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).  In this case,  as Defendants correctly note in their Response \nto Plaintiff’s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (ECF No. 37), the pleadings are not “closed”  \nbecau se Defendant has not filed an answer. See Atiyeh v. Nat'l Fire Ins. Co. of Hartford, 742 F. \nSupp. 2d 591, 595 (E.D. Pa. 2010) (“The pleadings are closed after an answer is filed, along with \na reply to any additional claims asserted in the answer.”) ( refere ncing Austin Powder Co. v. Knorr \nContracting, Inc., No. 3:08- CV-1428, 2009 WL 773695, at *1 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 20, 2009)); see also  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 7(a) (describing pleadings as a complaint, some sort of answer to a complaint, counterclaim, etc., and —if ordered by the court —a reply to an answer).   Thus, Plaintiff’s motion \nfor judgment on the pleadings is hereby denied for two reasons:  (1) the motion is premature as the \npleadings are not yet “closed”; and (2) the motion has essentially been rendered moot in light of this Memorandum , and accompanying Order, granting Defendant s’ motion to dismiss.  \nV. PRECLUDING LEA VE TO AMEND COMPLAINT  \nWhen a motion to dismiss is granted, the court must then decide whether to grant leave to \namend.  The Third Circuit has a liberal policy favoring amendment s, suggesting that  leave to \namend should be freely granted. See, e.g. , Oran v. Stafford, 226 F.3d 275, 291 (3d Cir. 2000); Dole \nv. Arco Chem. Co., 921 F.2d 484, 486 (3d Cir. 1990).  However, a court need not grant leave to \namend when it would be an exercise in futility. City of Cambridge Ret. Sys. v. Altisource Asset Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 13 of 14 14  \n Mgmt. Corp., 908 F.3d 872, 879 (3d Cir. 2018) (“Leave to amend is properly denied if amendment \nwould be futile, i.e. , if the proposed complaint could not ‘withstand a renewed motion to \ndismiss.’”) (quoting Jablonski v. Pan. Am. World Airways, Inc., 863 F.2d 289, 292 (3d Cir. 1988)); see also In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997) (recognizing that denial of leave to amend is not an abuse of discretion where the pleadings before the court demonstrate that further amendment would be futile).   \nFor the reasons ide ntified above, Plaintiff has failed to plead facts sufficient to establish a \nplausible claim for relief  in what is now Plaintiff’s fourth opportunity to do so over approximately \nnine months  (Plaintiff filed an original Complaint and three Amended Complaints).  This Court, \nin its  April 17, 2023 Order (ECF No. 31), explicitly warned that despite the in terest in permitting \namendment when justice requires it,  “Plaintiff’s filing of a Third Amended  Complaint will be the \nfinal pleading amendment permitted by this Court ” and any “[f]ailure to cure the purported \ndeficiencies in a Third Amended Complaint will result in dismissal of the . . . case with prejudice.” (Order on Mot. to Dis., p. 1 n. 1, ECF N o. 31.)  Given th e Court’s determination  in this \nMemorandum and this Court’s previous Order , a leave to amend would be futile .  This Court will \nnot grant Plaintiff a nother  chance to amend his complaint . \nVI. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant s’ motion to dismiss is hereby granted.  Relatedly, in \nlight of this Memorandum , and accompanying Order , dismissing this action with prejudice, \nDefendant s’ motion to stay this case is denied as moot .  \nAn appropriate Order follows.  IT IS SO ORDERED.  \nBY THE COURT:  \n         /s/ John Milton Younge   \n       JUDGE JOHN MILTON YOUNGE   Case 2:22-cv-03199-JMY   Document 39   Filed 07/24/23   Page 14 of 14",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Plaintiff Brendan Baker filed a class action lawsuit against CVS, alleging that during his job application process for a position in Massachusetts, he was unlawfully subjected to a lie detector test without the required notice of this statutory right under Massachusetts law. The case involves the use of a video-interview technology by HireVue, which utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze applicants' responses and provide employability scores, allegedly functioning as a lie detector test. The court denied CVS's motion to dismiss the claim that CVS violated the notice provision of Massachusetts' Lie Detector Statute.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Massachusetts' Lie Detector Statute allows for a private right of action for its notice provision when allegedly violated and whether the use of HireVue technology constitutes a lie detector test within the meaning of the statute.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff had standing to pursue the claim regarding the failure to provide statutory notice, as he alleged that he participated in the HireVue interview without being informed of his rights. The court also held that the statute unambiguously authorizes a lawsuit for the violation of its notice provision and thus denied CVS's motions to dismiss.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you wanted to get a job at a big store, and during the application, they asked you questions through a video while secretly trying to figure out if you're lying, using a fancy computer program. This computer program was supposed to be like a lie detector. There’s a local law that says stores can't do this without giving you a heads-up first, and if they do, you can take them to court. The court said you (and possibly others who had the same experience) have the right to complain to a judge because the store didn’t tell you about your rights and because a computer program might've been used to check if you were telling the truth without your knowledge.",

(collectively “CVS”)  under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  149, § 19B \n(“Lie Detector Statute”) . Baker alleges that when he applied for \na job with CVS, CVS unlawfully subjected him to a lie detector \ntest and failed to provide him required notice of his  statutory  \nrights.  \nThe second amended complaint  contains  three counts. First, \nBaker seeks a declaratory judgment that CVS’s application process \nviolates Massachusetts law and an injunction on that process 2 \n (Count I). Second, Baker alleges that CVS violated Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B(2) by subjecting him to a lie detector test \n(Count II). Third, Baker alleges that CVS violated Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B(2)(b) by failing to provide him required noti ce of \nhis statutory rights (Count III).1 Baker seeks to represent a class \nof “[a]ll persons who applied for a Massachusetts CVS position” \nand a sub -class of all applicants who “participated in a CVS \nHireVue Interview ,” which Baker alleges constituted a li e detector \ntest. Dkt. 35 at 8.  \nDefendants do not challenge the sufficiency of the claims \nthat CVS violate d the Lie Detector Statute. CVS moves to dismiss \nonly the third count , arguing that the Lie Detector Statute  does \nnot create a private right of action to enforce its notice \nprovisions  (Dkt. 22), and alternatively,  that Baker lacks  Article \nIII standing to challenge the lack of notice  (Dkt. 42). After \nhearing,  the Court DENIES CVS’s motions to dismiss Count III \n(Dkts. 22 & 42). \nBACKGROUND  \nI.  Statutory Scheme  \n The Lie Detector Statute  prohibits employers in Massachusetts \nfrom subjecting employees or applicants to lie detector tests  as \n \n1 Baker’s second amended complaint contains two counts listed as \n“Count II.” See Dkt. 35 at 10 -11. The Court treats the second of \nthose -- Baker’s notice -violation claim -- as “Count III.”  3 \n a condition of employment or continued employment . Mass. Gen. Laws \nch. 149, § 19B(2) . Under the statute, a lie detector test is:  \n[A]ny test utilizing a polygraph or any other device, \nmechanism, instrument  or written examination, which is \noperated, or the results of which are used or interpreted \nby an examiner for the purpose of purporting to assist \nin or enable the detection of deception, the \nverification of truthfulness, or the rendering of a \ndiagnostic o pinion regarding the honesty of an \nindividual.  \n \nId. § 19B(1). Subsection (2) provides:  \nIt shall be unlawful for any employer or his agent, with \nrespect to any of his employees, or any person applying \nto him for employment  . . . to subject such person to, \nor request such person to take a lie detector test . . . \nor to discharge, not hire, demote or otherwise \ndiscriminate against such person for the assertion of \nrights arising hereunder . . . . \n \n(a) The fact that such lie detector test was to be, \nor was, admin istered outside the commonwealth for \nemployment within the commonwealth shall not be a valid \ndefense to an action brought under the provisions of \nsubsection (3) or (4).  \n \n(b) All applications for employment within the \ncommonwealth shall contain the followin g notice which \nshall be in clearly legible print:  \n \n“It is unlawful in Massachusetts to require or \nadminister a lie detector test as a condition of \nemployment or continued employment. An employer who \nviolates this law shall be subject to criminal penalties \nand civil liability. ” \n \nId. § 19B(2).  Finally, Subsection (4) states :  \n \nAny person aggrieved by a violation of subsection (2) \nmay institute within three years of such violation and \nprosecute in his own name and on his own behalf, or for \nhimself and for other similarly situated, a civil action \nfor injunctive relief and any dama ges thereby incurred, 4 \n including treble damages for any loss of wages or other \nbenefits.  \n \nId. § 19B(4).   \n \nII.  CVS’s Application  Process \nDrawing all inferences  in favor of Baker, the Court accepts \nthe following  factual allegations  from the second amended \ncomplaint  as true. Around January 2021, Baker applied for a supply \nchain position  in Massachusetts  with CVS. The application,  which \nCVS posted online, did not include the notice of rights mandated  \nby the Lie Detector  Statute.  \nTo screen applicants , CVS administers a video-interview  \ntechnology developed by a company called HireVue, Inc.  (“HireVue \nInterview ”). During the HireVue Interview, a n applicant answers a \nseries of questions while being video -recorded. These include \nquestions like “What does integrity mean to you?”, “What would you \ndo if you saw someone cheating on a test?”, and “Tell me about a \ntime that you acted with integrity.” Dkt. 35 at 5. HireVue then \nuploads recordings of applicants’  responses t o a third -party \nplatform  called Affectiva , which  analyzes candidates’ facial \nexpressions, eye contact, voice intonation, and inflection using \nartificial intelligence. Through Affectiva, HireVue  uses data from \nan applicant’s  interview recording to  “draw[] conclusions \nregarding [her] degree of cultural fit” with CVS . Id. at 6. HireVue \nconveys its findings to CVS with a numerical “employability score” 5 \n or “competency -level scoring report”  for each applicant.  Id. at 7 \n(cleaned up).  HireVue has stated that it  can detect  whether a n \napplicant “[h]as an innate sense of integrity and honor,” help \nwith “lie detection” and “screen[ing] out embellishers ,” and \norganize applicant  competencies including “reliability, honesty, \n[and] integrity.” Id. at 5, 7-8.  \nDuring Baker’s application process, CVS administered a \nHireVue Interview  on him. Dkt. 35 at 2 , 4. He was “unaware, at the \ntime, that the HireVue Interview was a lie detector t est,” and \nstates that if he had been, “he would not have participated in the \nHireVue Interview.” Id. at 3. \nDISCUSSION  \nI.  Standing   \n CVS argues that Baker lacks standing to bring his notice claim \nbecause he has plead ed only a bare procedural violation without \nshowing concrete harm. “To establish Article III standing, a \nplaintiff must show (1) an injury in fact, (2) a sufficient causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of, and \n(3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \ndecision.”  Susan B.

An “injury in fact” must be “both \nconcrete  and particularized”  and “actual or imminent,  not \nconjectural  or hypothetical.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 6 \n 330, 339 (2016) (quoting  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, \n560 (1992)) .  \n“[T]he Supreme Court has repeatedly  said that denial of \ninformation  to which plaintiffs  have a legal right can be a \nconcrete  injury in fact.” Laufer v. Acheson Hotels, LLC, 50 F.4th \n259, 269 (1st Cir. 2022) (first citing Fed. Election  Comm’n v. \nAkins, 524 U.S. 11, 20-21 (1998); and then citing Pub. Citizen v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Just., 491 U.S. 440, 449-50 (1989)),  vacated as moot, \n601 U.S. 1 (2023). In some circumstances,  the Court has treated \nplaintiffs’  “asserted  uses for the information  they sought” as \nimmaterial  to the standing  analysis . Laufer v. Naranda Hotels, \nLLC, 60 F.4th 156, 170 (4th Cir. 2023); see, e.g., Havens Realty \nCorp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 373-74 (1982) (“A tester who has \nbeen the object of a misrepresentation  made unlawful  under [the \nstatute]  . . . has standing  to maintain  a claim for damages under \nthe Act’s provisions.”);  Pub. Citizen, 491 U.S. at 449 (“Our \ndecisions  . . . have never suggested  that those requesting  \ninformation  . . . need show more than that they sought and were \ndenied specific  agency records.”) ; see also Akins, 524 U.S. at 21 \n(“{A] plaintiff  suffers an ‘injury in fact’ when the plaintiff  \nfails to obtain information  which must be publicly  disclosed  \npursuant  to a statute.”).   \nHowever,  the Supreme Court’s recent decision  in TransUnion  \nLLC v. Ramirez muddied the waters. 594 U.S. 413 (2021). There, the 7 \n named plaintiff  sued a credit-reporting  agency under the Fair \nCredit Reporting  Act, which requires  that agencies  “disclose  to \nthe consumer  all information  in the consumer’s  file” upon request \nand provide a “summary  of rights” with “each written disclosure.”  \nId. at 418-19 (cleaned  up). He alleged, among other things, that \nwhen he requested  a copy of his credit file, the defendant  \ninitially  sent an incomplete  file along with the required  summary \nof rights, and then a day later, sent him the rest of his file \nwithout another summary of rights. The Court held that because the \nplaintiff  had ”not allege[d] that [he] failed to receive any \nrequired  information ,” rather “only that [he] received  it in the \nwrong format,” Akins and Public Citizen were distinguishable.  Id. \nat 441 (emphasis  omitted) . “Moreover, ” the Court held, “the \nplaintiff [] ha[d] identified  no ‘downstream  consequences’  from \nfailing to receive the required  information.”  Id. at 442. Thus, \nthe plaintiff’s  alleged informational  injury did not support \nArticle III standing.  \nThe legal question  is how to apply TransUnion  in light of the \n“informational  injury” cases that preceded  it. Since TransUnion , \nsome circuits  have held that plaintiffs  asserting  informational  \ninjuries  must show “(1) the denial of information  and (2) some \nconsequence  caused by that omission”  that has “some relevance”  to \nan interest  that the statute was intended  to protect.  Kelly v. \nRealPage  Inc., 47 F.4th 202, 213 (3d Cir. 2022); Laufer v. Looper, 8 \n 22 F.4th 871, 881 & n.6 (10th Cir. 2022); accord Harty v. W. Point \nRealty, Inc., 28 F.4th 435, 444 (2d Cir. 2022). Other circuits  \nhave narrowly  construed  TransUnion ’s discussion  of “downstream  \nconsequences”  as applying  only to the type of informational  injury \nat issue there: receiving  required  information  in the wrong format. \nSee, e.g., Laufer, 60 F.4th at 170 (holding that because “Havens \nRealty squarely  rejected  [a] use requirement”  and TransUnion  did \nnot overrule  Havens Realty, “any use requirement  is limited to the \ntype of informational  injury at issue in TransUnion  and does not \nextend to the type of informational  injury presented  in Public \nCitizen and Akins”). \nEven under an expansive  interpretation  of TransUnion , Baker \nhas pleaded a concrete  informational  injury. Baker alleges that he \nwas denied the notice of his rights under the Lie Detector  Statute,  \nnot that he received  notice in the wrong format. Additionally,  he \nhas plausibly  alleged that as a downstream  consequence  of not \nreceiving  notice, he participated  in a HireVue Interview.  Although  \nthe notice would not have specifically  informed  Baker that the \nHireVue Interview  was a lie detector  test, it would have primed \nhim to view the interview  more critically . Baker’s injury is of \nthe kind the statute was designed  to protect.  Accordingly , CVS’s \nRule 12(b)(1)  motion (Dkt. 42) is DENIED.2 \n \n2 Applicants  who never took the HireVue Interview may well be in a \ndifferent boat on  the standing question . 9 \n II.  Statutory  Interpretation  \nCVS also argues that the Lie Detector Statute does not \nauthorize suits to enforce its notice provision. Statutory \ninterpretation starts with the plain language of the \nstatute.  See United States v. Lachman, 387 F.3d 42, 50 (1st Cir. \n2004). Here, the Lie Detector  Statute authorizes  suit by “[a]ny \nperson aggrieved  by a violation  of subsection  (2),” which includes  \nthe notice requirement.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 149, § 19B(4); see id. \n§ 19B(2)(b).  CVS’s appeals to the Lie Detector  Statute’s  \nlegislative  history are unavailing  because the statutory  language  \nis unambiguous.  See Gen. Motors Corp. v. Darling’s, 444 F.3d 98, \n108 (1st Cir. 2006). Accordingly, CVS’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion  \n(Dkt. 22) is DENIED. \nORDER \nThis Court DENIES CVS’s motion s to dismiss for failure to \nstate a claim (Dkt. 22) and for lack of standing (Dkt. 42) .  \n \nSO ORDERED.  \n       \n/s/ PATTI B.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves a wrongful birth claim filed by plaintiffs against Xytex Corporation, a sperm bank, and associated individuals. The plaintiffs argue that through misrepresentation, they were misled about the qualifications and medical history of a sperm donor leading to the birth of their children. The case does not directly involve AI or automated systems. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss because wrongful birth claims are not recognized under Georgia law.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the claims by the plaintiffs, framed to argue misrepresentation and fraudulent inducement to use a sperm donor, constitute a wrongful birth claim, which is not recognized under Georgia law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiffs' claims were indeed a wrongful birth claim, which is not permissible under Georgia law, leading to the dismissal of the case.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: This case is about parents suing a sperm bank because they say the bank lied about a donor's background and health history. The parents claim they wouldn't have had kids with that donor if they knew the truth. Unfortunately for the parents, Georgia doesn't allow lawsuits where the claim is that a child should not have been born. So, the court decided the parents couldn't pursue their case.",

Th e individual Defendants were associated\nwith the Atlanta office of Xytex in various ways.1 \nOn October 18, 2000, James Aggeles applied to be a sperm donor with Xytex.2\nOn his application, Aggeles claimed that  he had a Bachelor’s Degree, a Master’s\nDegree, and that he was working towa rd his Ph.D. in artificial intelligence.3 None of\nthis was true, however, as Aggeles had act ually dropped out of school at that time.4\nPrior to applying to be a sperm donor, Aggeles had also been hospitalized and\ndiagnosed with psychotic schizophrenia,  narcissistic personality disorder, and\nsignificant grandiose delusions.5 But during Aggeles’ first visit to Xytex, the\nDefendant Hartley suggested to him that more educated donors did better selling their\nsperm.6 As a result, Aggeles filled out his application falsely by inflating his\neducational background and lying about his mental health history.7\n1Compl. ¶¶ 1-9.\n2Id. at ¶ 12.\n3Id. at ¶ 13.\n4Id. at ¶ 21.\n5Id. at ¶ 20.\n6Id. at ¶ 21.\n7Id.\n-2- T:\\ORDERS\\16\\Doe\\16cv1453\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:16-cv-01453-TWT   Document 29   Filed 03/17/17   Page 2 of 9Despite Xytex’s claim that all applicants went through a rigorous qualification\nprocedure that takes months to complete, including a medical review and regularupdates to their medical and criminal hi stories, Aggeles was approved as a donor\nwithin two weeks.\n8 The Complaint alleges that he was only given a ten minute\nphysical examination, during which no physical or mental health history wasdiscussed.\n9 After Aggeles was a pproved as a sperm donor, he was hospitalized\nnumerous times for mental h ealth reasons, and was arre sted on numerous occasions.10\nBetween 2000 to 2016, Aggeles became one of Xytex’s most popular donors.11\nFamilies often desired the sperm of highl y educated and accomplished people, and\nXytex promoted Aggeles as such a do nor based upon the information in his\napplication. During those years, Aggeles became the biological father of at least\nthirty-six children through Xytex’s sale of  his sperm, including the Plaintiffs’ two\nchildren.12 \n8Id. at ¶¶ 18, 22.\n9Id. at ¶ 22.\n10Id. at ¶ 23.\n11Id. at ¶ 24.\n12Id.\n-3- T:\\ORDERS\\16\\Doe\\16cv1453\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:16-cv-01453-TWT   Document 29   Filed 03/17/17   Page 3 of 9The Plaintiffs, a same-sex couple from England, had first heard about Xytex\nthrough a friend, and they began searchi ng for potential donors on the Xytex website.\nWhen they came across Aggeles’ profile , known as Donor #9623, they chose him as\ntheir donor because he “ticked every single box,” meaning that he was healthy, well\neducated, and supposedly had a high IQ. Th e Plaintiffs called and emailed Xytex to\ninquire about Aggeles’ sperm, and they were  told that Aggeles’ sperm was extremely\npopular and rarely available.  As a result of Xytex’s representations, the Plaintiffs\npurchased Aggeles’ sperm and the Plaintiff Jane Doe 1 gave birth to their first child\non February 28, 2012.

Discussion\nThe Defendants’ primary argument is that  all of the Plaintiffs’ claims are\nderivative of a wrongful birth action, and because wrongful birth claims are notrecognized in Georgia, the Plaintiffs’ claims  must be dismissed. In other words, the\nDefendants argue that all of the Plaintiffs’ claims fundamentally stand on the assertion\nthat if the Plaintiffs had known the truth about Aggeles, the Pl aintiffs’ two children\nwould not have been born. The Plaintiffs, fo r their part, argue that this case is not one\nfor wrongful birth , but rather for wrongful conception .\nIn Georgia, wrongful conception claims generally arise when a sterilization or\nabortion procedure goes wrong and a live birth unintentionally results.\n20 In such a\ncase, the measure of damages allows “r ecovery of expenses for the unsuccessful\nmedical procedure which led to concepti on or pregnancy, fo r pain and suffering,\n18See Lombard’s, Inc. v.

According to the Plaintiffs, when the\nwrong occurs before conception and directly causes the harm, as in failed sterilization\ncases, the tort is allowed. And when the wrong occurs after conception and indirectly\ncauses the harm, as in failure-to-di agnose cases, the tort is disallowed.\nThe Plaintiffs are incorrect. The reason why Georgia courts have looked on\nwrongful birth claims with disfavor is not because of the timing of the tort or thecausal link between the defenda nt and the harm.  The true difference between the two\ntorts is the measure of damages. Wrongful birth claims are disfavored because they\n21Id. at 443.\n22Atlanta Obstetrics & Gynecology Grp. v.

The Georgia courts are “unwilling to say that life, even life with\nsevere impairments, may ever  amount to a legal injury.”24 In this case, the Plaintiffs\nessentially claim that had the Defendants been truthful with them about Aggeles’\nhistory, they would not have used his sp erm and their children would not have been\nborn. \nThe Plaintiffs attempt to mask this tr uth by describing the Defendants as having\n“exposed Plaintiffs and their child to [Aggeles’] traits through theirmisrepresentations.”\n25 But a genetic disease is not the same as a virus or a bacteria.\nAvoiding “exposure” to Aggeles’  various mental health problems would not mean the\nPlaintiffs’ two children would be healthier;  it would mean they would not exist.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The court case involves Joseph Lee Jones, who filed a habeas corpus petition challenging his pretrial detention, claiming he has been held longer than the sentence he might serve if convicted. The petition is dismissed on other grounds, such as his claims concerning personal financial grievances and allegations involving AI-related topics such as an \"AI research grant,\" which are not suitable for a federal habeas corpus action. AI technology is mentioned in Jones's petition in connection with his background as an \"Artificial Intelligence Researcher,\" but does not form the basis for legal claims or holding.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the federal court can intervene in Joseph Lee Jones's pretrial detention when there are ongoing state criminal proceedings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court holds that it must abstain from intervening in the state criminal proceedings under the doctrines established in *Ex parte Royall* and *Younger v. Harris*, since there are ongoing state legal processes and no extraordinary circumstances justifying federal intervention.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Joseph Lee Jones believes he's been unfairly held in jail for longer than necessary, waiting for a mental health evaluation. He tried to use a federal court to get out, but because his case is still active in the state courts, the federal judge said they can't do anything yet. Also, he mentioned some unrelated issues like AI, which confused things more. The judge told Jones he needs more proof of a very unusual situation if he wants federal help right now.",

CASE NO. 24-3216-JWL         \n JAY ARMBRISTER,    \n   Respondent.  \n  \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \nOn December 2, 2024, Petitioner Joseph Lee Jone s began this case by filing a petition for \nwrit of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and a motion for leav e to proceed in forma \npauperis. (Docs. 1 and 2.) Petitioner ultimately was denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis (Doc. 7) and he has now paid the required filing fee.  \nRule 4 Review \nRule 4 of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases requ ires the Court to review a habeas petition \nupon filing and to dismiss it “[i]f it plainly appears from the petition a nd any attached exhibits that \nthe petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court.” Rules Governing § 2254 Cases in the \nUnited States District Courts, Rule  4, 28 U.S.C.A. foll. § 2254. Rule 1( b) authorizes district courts \nto apply the Rules to habeas petitions not brought under § 2254, such as those brought under § 2241. Because Petitioner is proceeding pro se, the Court liberally construes the pleading, but it \nmay not act as Petitioner’s advocate. See James v. Wadas , 724 F.3d 1312, 1315 (10th Cir. 2013). \n“[T]he court cannot take on the re sponsibility of serving as the litigant’s atto rney in constructing \narguments.” Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux & Janer , 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005). It \n“‘may not rewrite a petition to include claims that were never presented.’” Childers v. Crow , 1 Case 5:24-cv-03216-JWL     Document 8     Filed 02/07/25     Page 1 of 62 \n F.4th 792, 798 (10th Cir. 2021) (citation omitted). \nThe Petition (Doc. 1)  \nThe petition in this matter is  difficult to understa nd. Petitioner has used  the required, court-\napproved form for filing a petition under 28 U.S. C. § 2241, but he does not always set forth the \ninformation requested on the form and his assertions are ofte n wide-ranging. At various points in \nthe petition, he refers to his status as an “Artificial Intelligence Researcher and Fractal Mathematics Developer,” unnamed people stealing  his “Amazon money on [his] math book,” “an \nOpenAI Chat GPT A.I. research grant,” mail fraud, transhumanism, the digital millennial kingdom, and other topics. The statements Petitioner has written in the spaces for setting forth the \nspecific grounds for relief and th e facts that support e ach ground do not clearly  identify his grounds \nfor relief.  \nFor example, in the space for setting fo rth Ground One and supporting facts for Ground \nOne, Petitioner states, “Affirmative Defense as a Re searcher I’ve tried over and over to present it \nI have the right to be heard, my due process be fore during and after I ha d right affiliations/and \nagenda so its impossible to be  criminal to begin with. [ sic]” (Doc. 1, p. 11.) In the space for setting \nforth Ground Two and its supporting facts, Petitioner states:  “Mar tial Laws See NATURE Digital \nDrug user google it Military Level opid research  auditing I had to Stay in the drug game. [ sic]” Id. \nGrounds Three, Four, and Five are similarly difficult to comprehend. See id  at 11-13. \nWith his petition, however, Petiti oner filed a statement attribut ing “any prior confusion” in \nprevious cases before this Cour t to “how [Peti tioner’s] brain pro cesses things and [to] cognitive \ndecline.” (Doc. 1, p. 17.) He further explains in that statement that he is “being held beyond the \ntime even possible if convicted of violating pr obation” and he has been “waiting on a Larned \nhospital bed” for 18 months  “due to incompetence.” Id. This appears to relate to the assertion on Case 5:24-cv-03216-JWL     Document 8     Filed 02/07/25     Page 2 of 63 \n page one of the petition that he is “stuck held in competent to have a hearing to see if I violated \nprobation. Now waiting 18 months on hospital bed.” Id. at 1.  \nWhen the petition is liberally construed and cons idered in light of this attached statement, \nit appears that Petitioner asse rts that in 2024, the Douglas C ounty District Co urt sentenced \nPetitioner to 12 months of probation. ( See Doc. 1, p. 1.) While he was on that probation, Petitioner \nwas criminally charged in Shawnee County, Kansas . The Shawnee County District Court released \nPetitioner on bond, but Petitioner was then arrested on allegations that he had violated his Douglas \nCounty probation. The Douglas County District Court denied  Petitioner’s re quest for bond. Id. at \n3.  \nAlthough it is not clear which state district court first considered  the issue, at least one of \nthe courts ordered Petitioner to undergo a competency evaluation. Id. He was found incompetent \nand is now in custody at the Douglas County Jail wa iting for a bed to become available at a state \nhospital so that he can receive the court-ordered treatment intende d to restore him to competency. \nId. at 17. He alleges that the time he has been waiting for a bed is longer than the sentence he \nwould face if were found to have violated his probation. As relief , Petitioner seeks his release from \njail and dismissal of “all cases.” Id. at 13. \nAnalysis \nAs an initial point, a federal habeas action is  not the proper avenue by which to (1) reclaim \nmoney related to the online sale of Plaintiff’s math book, (2) obtain an order directing action on \nneuromorphic transistors that ha ve been beamed into his brain, (3) obtain compensation for the \nmilitary Space Force’s and K.U.’s us e of his services, (4) initiate an  investigation of alleged mail \nfraud, (5) obtain certified-mail serv ices at Douglas County Jail, or  (6) bring a claim that jail \nconditions violated his Eighth Amendm ent rights. Thus, to the extent that Petitioner se eks relief in Case 5:24-cv-03216-JWL     Document 8     Filed 02/07/25     Page 3 of 64 \n this matter on any of the aforementioned  points, such claims are dismissed.  \nLiberally construing the pro se petition and a ttachments thereto, Petitioner also seeks in \nthis federal habeas matter to challenge his pretrial  detention, which is on e proper use of petitions \nseeking relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. See Yellowbear v. Wyo. Atty. Gen. , 525 F.3d 921, 924 (10th \nCir. 2008) (citing Walck v. Edmonson , 472 F.3d 1227, 1235 (10th Cir. 2007)); Smith v. Crow , 2022 \nWL 12165390, *2 (10th Cir. Oct. 21, 2022) (unpublished). As the Court understands it, Petitioner argues that he has now been detained without tr ial for longer than the pot ential sentence he faces \nif he is convicted on the underl ying criminal charges. If the C ourt’s understanding of Petitioner’s \nclaim is incorrect, Petitioner should notify the Court in writing and should clarify the nature of his \nground for relief.  \nIf the Court has correctly construed Petitioner’s claim in this matter, it must consider the \nabstention doctrines in Younger v. Harris , 401 U.S. 37 (1971), and Ex parte Royall , 117 U.S. 241 \n(1886). In Ex parte Royall , the United States Supreme Cour t described some very limited \ncircumstances in which such intervention might be proper. See 117 U.S. at 251-52. The Supreme \nCourt explained that otherwise, federal courts must abstain from  interfering with the process of \nstate courts. Id. at 252 (stating that federal courts’ non-interference with st ate courts “is a principle \nof right and law, and therefore of necessity”). Even liberally construed, the petition in this case does not allege the type of circumstances under which Ex parte Royall  permits federal-court \nintervention in an ongoing state criminal prosecution. \nNearly a century after Ex parte Royall , in Younger v. Harris , the Supreme C ourt reaffirmed \nthat principles of comity dictat e that generally a federal court is  not to interven e in ongoing state \ncriminal proceedings unless “irreparable injury” is “both great and immediate.” See Younger , 401 \nU.S. at 46. Under Younger , federal courts must abstain from exercising ju risdiction when:  “(1) Case 5:24-cv-03216-JWL     Document 8     Filed 02/07/25     Page 4 of 65 \n there is an ongoing state criminal . . . proceeding;  (2) the state court provides an adequate forum \nto hear the claims raised in th e federal [petition]; a nd (3) the state proceedings involve important \nstate interests.” Winn v. Cook , 945 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2019).  \nThe Court finds that the information pr esently before it shows that three Younger  \nconditions are present. There is at least one ongoi ng state criminal proceeding and perhaps two, so \nthe first condition is satisfied. Wi th respect to the third conditi on, the State of Kansas has an \nimportant interest in prosecuting crimes charging th e violation of Kansas la ws and in administering \nits criminal justice system, including competency-related proceedings. See Winn , 945 F.3d at 1258  \n(“For the purposes of Younger , state criminal proceedings are view ed as ‘a traditional area of state \nconcern.’”); See also Kelly v. Robinson , 479 U.S. 36, 49 (1986) (citing Younger  and recognizing \n“that the States’ interest in administering th eir criminal justice systems free from federal \ninterference is one of the most powerful of th e considerations that should influence a court \nconsidering equitable ty pes of relief.”).  \nAs to the second Younger condition, when the petition is liberally construed, Petitioner \nasserts that the state courts do not provide an adeq uate forum because he has filed multiple lawsuits \nand motions without a response from the State. (Doc. 1, p. 9.) Petitioner does not provide more \nspecific information about his efforts. The Court understands that Peti tioner is unable to \n“remember [his] recent case numbers or dates and times.” ( See Doc. 1, p. 5.) But without additional \ninformation on Petitioner’s efforts to present to  the state courts his claim that he is being \nunconstitutionally detained, the Cour t cannot find that the state cour ts do not provid e an adequate \nforum for that claim.  \nIf the three Younger  circumstances are present, as they are here, federal abstention is \nmandatory, unless extraordinary ci rcumstances require otherwise. Brown ex rel. Brown v. Day , Case 5:24-cv-03216-JWL     Document 8     Filed 02/07/25     Page 5 of 66 \n 555 F.3d 882, 888 (10th Cir. 2009) (quoting Amanatullah v. Co. Bd. of Med. Examiners , 187 F.3d \n1160, 1163 (10th Cir. 1999)). Extraordinary circumst ances that warrant fe deral intervention in \nongoing state criminal proceedings include cases “‘of proven harassment or prosecutions undertaken by state officials in bad faith w ithout hope of obtaining a valid conviction.’” \nAmanatullah , 187 F.3d at 1165. However, a petitioner asse rting such circumstances must make \n“‘more than mere allegations of bad faith or harassment.’” Id. At this point, on the information \nnow before the Court, this matt er is subject to dismissal becau se the Court must abstain from \nintervening in the state proceedings at issue. \n IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  that Petitioner is granted to and including March 10, \n2025 , to show cause, in writing, why this matter s hould not be dismissed in its entirety because Ex \nParte Royall  and Younger  require the Court to abstain from hear ing this matter. The failure to file \na timely response to this order will  result in this matter being dism issed without further prior notice \nto Petitioner. \n \n IT IS SO ORDERED. \n DATED:  This 7th day of Februa ry, 2025, at Kansas City, Kansas. \n       S/ John W.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Craig Vanness v. Elon Musk, Vanness filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that Musk and his company Neuralink, in conjunction with the former Trump Administration, were using a fictional AI called “Acoustic Fingerprint ‘Beast’ Capitalist A.I.” for mind control and electronic torture. The court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, labeling it as frivolous and citing that Vanness is a “three-striker” under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g), due to prior frivolous lawsuits. The dismissal underscores the misuse of AI as a baseless claim by Vanness.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Vanness's claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 regarding the alleged use of AI for mind control by Elon Musk were legally sufficient, and whether he could proceed in forma pauperis given his status as a three-striker under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Vanness's complaint was frivolous, characterized by fantastical and delusional allegations, and was thus dismissed with prejudice. The court also found that Vanness, designated as a three-striker due to prior frivolous actions, could not proceed in forma pauperis without paying the filing fee, resulting in automatic dismissal under the three-strikes rule.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Vanness sued Elon Musk, claiming Musk's company Neuralink was controlling minds using a made-up AI. The court threw out the case because it was a nonsensical story and Vanness had a history of filing ridiculous lawsuits without paying the necessary court fees. The law says if you do this three times, you can't keep using the court’s resources without paying, unless you're in serious danger, which Vanness wasn’t. This dismissal stops Vanness from continuing the lawsuit without paying, as the court found his claims silly and not possible.",

Here,  Vanness pursues a  class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of the \n“poor unfortunate people of the world.” Complaint [ECF No. 1] at 1. In a one -page delusional \ndiatribe, Vanness alleges that the Defendant, Elon Musk , uses his company Neuralink “for \ngovernment mind cont rol.” Ibid. He says Musk, along with the “Trump A dmin[istration],” uses a form \nof “electronic torture”  called the “Acoustic Fingerprint ‘Beast’ Capitalist A.I.” to lie “to the world” \nabout our perceived reality —at least, we think that’s what Vanness is claiming. Ibid. (cleaned up). He \nseeks $50 billion in damages  “for each country” and person affected. Ibid.  After careful review, we \nDISMISS  Vanness’s Complaint with prejudice as frivolous and under the “three -strikes” provision of \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).  \n \n1 See Complaint , Vanness v. Criminal Enterprise , No. 25- cv-21218- RAR  (S.D. Fla. Mar. 13, 2025), ECF \nNo. 1; Complaint, Vanness v. Lee Cnty. Sheriff’s Off., No. 25- cv-21193- JB (S.D. Fla.

Case 1:25-cv-21200-RKA   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/21/2025   Page 1 of 52 \n THE LAW \nWhen a prisoner -plaintiff proceeds IFP, his complaint must be screened under the provisions \nof 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g) —also known as the “three -strikes provision.” White v. Lemma , 947 F.3d 1373, \n1379 (11th Cir. 2020) (“[A] court must procedurally dismiss without prejudice the claim of a prisoner \nwho has struck out under the three -strikes provision and failed to pay the filing fee, [but] the court \nmay also consider the merits to di smiss the case with prejudice instead.”), abrogated in part on other grounds \nby Wells v. Brown , 58 F.4th 1347, 1357 (11th Cir. 2023) (en banc). That provision reads, in pertinent \npart, as follows:  \nIn no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal  a judgment in a civil action \nor proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, \nwhile incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of \nthe United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or \nfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under \nimminent danger of serious physical injury.  \n 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).  \n In other words, “[s]ection 1915 only allows a prisoner to file thre e meritless suits at the reduced \nrate provided by that section.” Dupree v. Palmer , 284 F.3d 1234, 1236 (11th Cir. 2002) (cleaned up). \nOnce a prisoner has had three suits dismissed for one (or more) of the reasons set out in § 1915(g), \nhe “must pay the full  filing fee at the time he initiates  suit[.]” Ibid. (emphasis in original). If the plaintiff \ndoesn’t pay the filing fee when he files his lawsuit —and unless he qualifies for the “imminent danger \nof serious physical injury” exception—the Court must “dismiss  the action without prejudice when it \ndenies the prisoner leave to proceed in forma pauperis .” Ibid.  \nA\nNALYSIS  \nOur review of Vanness’s litigation history reveals that he’s already been designated a three -\nstriker. See Order Dismissing Complaint, Vanness v. S hasta Cnty. , No. 25- cv-21203 (S.D. Fla. Mar. 14, \n2025)  (Bloom, J.) , ECF No. 3 at 1 (dismissing Vanness’s complaint “because he has three ‘strikes’ \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g)” ). That’s because, before Vanness  was ever labeled a three -striker, Vanness  Case 1:25-cv-21200-RKA   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/21/2025   Page 2 of 53 \n had (at least) three cases dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim for relief.  See Order \nDismissing Case, Vanness v. Monroe Cnty. Jail , No. 25- cv-10007 (S.D. Fla. Jan. 28, 2025)  (Gayles, J.) , \nECF No . 3 at 2 (finding “Plaintiff’s pleading is clearly frivolous and must be dismissed”); Order of \nDismissal, Vanness v. Acoustic Fingerprint , No. 25- cv-10016 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 25, 2025)  (Gayles, J.) , ECF \nNo. 4 at 1 (dismissing Plaintiff’s complaint “as frivolou s pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §  1915A”); Order on \nScreening, Vanness v. Monroe Cnty. Jail Booking Officers , No. 25- cv-10015 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 18, 2025)  \n(Dimitrouleas, J.) , ECF No. 3 at 6 (dismissing Plaintiff’s complaint “pursuant to 28 U.S.C . § 1915(a)(1) \nfor fai lure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted”) . Since Vanness  “has had three previous \nactions dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim,” Vanness  is a three -striker under § 1915(g) \nand must pay the filing fee . Wright v. Polk Cnty., 556 F. App ’x 873, 874–75 (11th Cir. 2014) .  \nVanness  (it’s true) could  avoid the three -strikes label by alleging that he “is under imminent \ndanger of serious physical injury.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g). To do this, however, he’d have to show “that \nhe was in imm inent danger of serious physical injury at the time he filed his Complaint or that he was \nin jeopardy of any ongoing danger.” Medberry v. Butler , 185 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 1999). But \nVanness  doesn’t even try  to meet this exception . In fact,  Vanness  never specifically  alleges that he’s \never suffered a physical injury —much less that he’s currently facing the threat of one . See Abdullah v. \nMigoya , 955 F. Supp. 2d 1300, 1307 (S.D. Fla. 2013) (Zloch, J.) (“A plaintiff must provide the court \nwith specific allegations . . . that a serious physical injury will result if his claims are not addressed.” \n(emphasis added)). So, the “imminent danger” exception doesn’t apply here, meaning Vanness  is \nsubject to the three -strikes rule and can’t proceed IFP. See Dupree, 284 F.3d at 1236 (“Section 1915 \nonly allows a prisoner to file three meritless suits at the reduced rate provided by that section. After the third meritless suit, the prisoner must pay the full filing fee at the time he initiates suit.” (cleaned up)). Since Vanness  has failed to pay the filing fee, his Complaint must be dismissed. See White , 947 Case 1:25-cv-21200-RKA   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/21/2025   Page 3 of 54 \n F.3d at 1377 (“ [A] district court must dismiss a prisoner’s claims when the prisoner has three strikes \nbut failed to pay the filing fee when the suit began.” ). \nWe also find that Vanness’s Complaint is (clearly) frivolous, so we’ll dismiss it with prejudice —\neven though a § 1915(g) dismissal is generally without prejudice . See White , 947 F.3d at 1379 (“So though \na court must procedurally dismiss without prejudice the claim of a prisoner who has struck out under \nthe three -strikes provision and failed to pay the filing fee, the court may also consider the merits to \ndismiss the case with prejudice instead.”). A complaint is “frivolous” where the factual allegations are  \n“clearly baseless.” Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989). These involve  “fantastic or delusional \nscenarios,” id. at 328, or claims  that “rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible,” Denton \nv. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 33 (1992); see also Davis v. Kvalheim , 261 F. App’x 231, 235 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(affirming the district court’s sua sponte dismissal of a complaint with prejudice because the plaintiff’s \n“allegations were clearly baseless and without arguable merit in fact”).  “[T]he frivolousness \ndetermination is a discretionary one[.]” Denton , 504 U.S. at 33.    \nNo doubt, Vanness’s claims are pure, unfiltered lunacy . He explains that “no one is safe from \nthe mark of the beast” —that “mark” being (we think) the amorphous “Acoustic Fingerprint ‘Beast’ \nCapitalist A.I.” —that “runs the world by controlling its victims.” Compl. at 1. This form of “electronic \ntorture” (Vanness say s) is employed by  Musk’s  Neuralink, which ( he also says) “is an antenna for \ngovernment mind control .” Ibid. After accusing Musk and the “Trump Admin[istration]” of lying \nabout “negotiating a ceasefire,” Vanness insists that “the matrix is real ,” that the  Central Intelligence \nAgency “has the world on its puppet strings,” and  (unrel atedly)  that “[Adolf] Hitler was killed” by \nmethamphetamine.  Ibid.  (cleaned up). These nonsense claims  clearly “reflect the thoughts of a \nparanoid” and “ delusional individual”  and make a mockery of the judicial process.  Taylor v. Wardworth , \n2007 WL 1266363, at *2 (M.D. Ala. Apr. 30, 2007)  (Watkins, J.).  Case 1:25-cv-21200-RKA   Document 3   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/21/2025   Page 4 of 55 \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit has consistently affirmed the with-prejudice dismissal of frivolous § 1983 \ncomplaints , and, based on Vanness’s claims,  we’re (quite) sure that disposition is appropriate here. See, \ne.g., Broner v. Wash. Mut. Bank, F.A. , 258 F. App ’x 254, 256–57 (11th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he district court \ndid not abuse its discretion in finding her complaint frivolous and did not err in finding that it failed \nto state  a claim. Accordingly, her complaint was properly dismissed with prejudice, pursuant to § \n1915(e)(2).”); Nails v. Franklin , 279 F. App ’x 899, 901 (11th Cir. 2008) (“We agree that Plaintiff ’s suit \nis frivolous and should be dismissed with prejudice.”).  So, for all these reasons, we DISMISS  \nVanness’s  Complaint with prejudice .  \n* * * \nWe therefore  ORDER AND ADJUDGE  that Craig Vanness ’s Complaint [ECF No. 1] is \nDISMISSED with prejudice  as frivolous and for violating 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g). The Clerk of Court \nshall CLOSE  this case. All pending motions are DENIED  as moot.  \nDONE AND ORDERED in the Southern District of Florida on March 20, 2025.  \n  \n \n \n         _________________________________ \n         ROY K.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves Joseph Lee Jones, who filed a habeas corpus petition challenging his conviction for forgery and identity theft. Jones claims his sentence is illegal due to his status as an artificial intelligence researcher and presents multiple grounds for relief related to constitutional rights and disabilities. The court found the petition unclear and required Jones to submit an amended petition. The involvement of AI is highlighted in Jones's claims concerning his identity and work as an artificial intelligence researcher, which he argues are related to the fairness and legality of his sentencing.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Joseph Lee Jones's habeas corpus petition meets the requirements to assert clear legal claims challenging the conviction and the legality of his sentence based on constitutional violations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Jones's petition was too vague and lacked the necessary specificity required by Rule 2(c) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases. As a result, he was ordered to file an amended petition that clearly articulates his claims by November 4, 2024. Failure to do so may result in dismissal without prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you tell your teacher your homework isn't fair because you're a brilliant science enthusiast, but you explain it in a very confusing way.

    "full_text": "1 \n  \n IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS \n  JOSEPH LEE JONES,               \n \n Petitioner,  \n \nv.       CASE NO. 24-3172-JWL         \n JAY ARMBRISTER, ET AL.\n1,   \n \n   Respondents.  \n  \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \nOn September 30, 2024, Petitioner Joseph Lee Jones, who is detained at the Douglas \nCounty Jail in Lawrence, Kansas, began this cas e by filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254 and a motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. (Docs. 1, 2, and \n3.) The motion for leave to proceed in fo rma pauperis (Doc. 2) will be granted.  \nRule 4 Review \nRule 4 of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases requ ires the Court to review a habeas petition \nupon filing and to dismiss it “[i]f it plainly appears from the petition a nd any attached exhibits that \nthe petitioner is not entitled to relief in the district court.” Rules Governing § 2254 Cases in the \nUnited States District Courts, Ru le 4, 28 U.S.C.A. foll. § 2254. To  obtain federal habeas corpus \nrelief, a state prisoner must demons trate that he or she “is in cust ody in violation of the Constitution \nor laws or treaties of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2241(c)(3). More specifically, a petition \n \n1 Petitioner has named Jay Armbrister, Bria n Cole, and Kris Kobach as Respondents in this action, but the proper \nrespondent in a federal habeas action by a state prisoner is the person who has custody over the petitioner. See Rumsfeld \nv. Padilla , 542 U.S. 426, 443 (2004) (“[I]n habeas challenges to  present physical confinement ... the default rule is \nthat the proper respondent is the warden of the facility wh ere the prisoner is being held .”). Thus, Jay Armbrister, the \nSheriff of Douglas County, Kansas, wh ere Petitioner is currently confined in  the Douglas County Jail, is hereby \nsubstituted as the sole Respondent pursuant to Rule 2(a)  of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United \nStates District Courts and Rules 25(d) and 81(a)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Case 5:24-cv-03172-JWL     Document 4     Filed 10/03/24     Page 1 of 52 \n properly brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 challenges  the constitutionality  of a state court \nconviction. See Estelle v. McGuire , 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991). Because Petitioner is proceeding \npro se, the Court liberally construes the pleadin g, but it may not act as Petitioner’s advocate. See \nJames v. Wadas , 724 F.3d 1312, 1315 (10th Cir. 2013). “[ T]he court cannot take on the \nresponsibility of serving as  the litigant’s attorney in  constructing arguments.” Garrett v. Selby \nConnor Maddux & Janer , 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005). It “‘may not rewrite a petition to \ninclude claims that were never presented.’” Childers v. Crow , 1 F.4th 792, 798 (10th Cir. 2021) \n(citation omitted). \nThe petition in this matter is difficult to understand, but Petiti oner identifies the conviction \nat issue as having occurred in the District C ourt of Douglas County, Ka nsas. (Doc. 1, p. 1.) He \nstates that he pled guilty to a nd was convicted of forgery and iden tity theft and was sentenced in \nFebruary or March of 2024 to 12 months of intensive supervised probation (ISP). Id. Petitioner \nconcedes that he “did the crime,” but he contends  that the sentence is illeg al “because [he is] an \nArtificial intelligence rese[archer] and [he has] A.O.R.C.i.d. [ sic]” Id. at 2. Petitioner asserts four \ngrounds for relief. \nIn Ground One, Petitioner asserts the violation of  his rights to “due process of law, equal \nopp[o]rtunity and equal protection,” as well as hi s rights under the Ameri cans with Disabilities \nAct. Id. at 8. In the space for providing supporting f acts for Ground One, Peti tioner states:  “The \ninternational research For Huma nity by an unquestionably Honest  reformed person BLACK box \nsociety cannot openly explain TRADE  Secrets, of how things like presentence 3Rd party software \nand its affective GLOBAL impl[i]cations on Research [ sic ].” Id. As Ground Two, Petitioner \nalleges the violation of his “1st Amendment rights, etc.” Id. at 9. In the sp ace for providing \nsupporting facts for Ground Tw o, Petitioner asserts:  Case 5:24-cv-03172-JWL     Document 4     Filed 10/03/24     Page 2 of 53 \n Of ability to practice Reli gion or be recognized as a religion.

[ sic]” \n \nId. \nAs Ground Three, Petitioner asse rts the violation of his cons titutional right to access the \ncourts. Id. at 11. In the space for providing supporti ng facts for Ground Three, Petitioner states: \n“As if it was truly more than a mental health or  memory issue on hour and what to construe. If I \nhave EU protections certified ma il a must is denied access privat e lawyer blocked by fiduciary \npayee along with the ability to pay filing and docket fees.” Id. (capitalization normalized, all other \nerrors in original). As Ground Four, Petitioner asse rts his “8th Amend[ment] right to not be coerced \nand influence[d].” Id. at 12. As supporting facts for Gr ound Four, Petitioner explains the \ncircumstances and timelines of the criminal st ate-court proceedings against him in Shawnee \nCounty and Douglas County, Kansas. Id. at 13-15, 17. As relief, Petitio ner seeks dismissal of all \ncharges, his release from jail, and his imm ediate transport to a “mental hospital.” Id. at 20. \nAnalysis \nRule 2(c) of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts \nprovides: \nThe petition must: \n (1) specify all the ground s for relief available to the petitioner; \n (2) state the facts supporting each ground; \n (3) state the relief requested;  (4) be printed, typewritten, or legibly handwritten; and \n (5) be signed under penalty of perj ury by the petitione r or a person \nauthorized to sign it for the petitioner under 28 U.S.C. § 2242. Case 5:24-cv-03172-JWL     Document 4     Filed 10/03/24     Page 3 of 54 \n  \nThe United States Supreme Cour t has explained that “[a] pr ime purpose of Rule 2(c)’s \ndemand that habeas petitioners plead with particularity is to assist the district court in determining \nwhether the [respondent] should be ordered to ‘show cause why th e writ should not be granted’” \nor whether the petition should be summarily dismissed under Rule 4. See Mayle v. Felix , 545 U.S. \n644, 656 (2005) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 2243). “If the cour t orders the [respondent ] to file an answer, \nthat pleading must ‘a ddress the allegations  in the petition.’” Id. (citing Habeas Rule 5(b)). This \nrequires the allegations to be clear enough that the respondent will be able to address them.  \nThe petition in this matter fails to comply w ith Rule 2(c), leaving this Court unable to \ndetermine the precise claims Petitioner wishes to assert in this matter. In one part of the form petition, Petitioner alleges that he  is challenging being sentenced to  ISP. Yet none of the asserted \ngrounds for relief obviously relate to that sentence and the fa cts asserted in support of each ground \ndo not obviously relate to the constitutional violati on he has alleged. In shor t, the Court is unable \nto discern the precise claims Petitioner intends to assert in this federal habeas matter and the Court \nis unable to discern the facts alle ged in support of each claim. T hus, the petition fa ils to comply \nwith the specificity requirements of Habeas Rule 2(c). The Court can not determine from the \npetition now before it whether “petit ioner is not entitled to relief in the district court,” so it is \nunable to conduct a meaningful Rule 4 review.  \nAmended Petition Required \nFor the reasons explained above, the Court conclu des that this matter cannot proceed unless \nPetitioner files a complete and proper amended petition on the re quired court-appr oved form. The \nCourt will therefore grant Petitioner to and including November 4, 2024  in which to file his \namended petition. The Court will di rect the clerk to provide Petit ioner with the necessary forms \nand instructions.  Case 5:24-cv-03172-JWL     Document 4     Filed 10/03/24     Page 4 of 55 \n If Petitioner submit s an amended petition, it must be on the court-approved forms and must \nbe complete in and of itself. Th e amended petition may not  refer back to the initially filed petition \nor attempt to incorporate by reference the initial pe tition or any other filings  with this Court. Any \ngrounds for relief no t included in the amended pe tition will not be consid ered before the Court. \nPetitioner must include the case number of this action (24-3172) on the firs t page of the amended \npetition. If Petitioner submits an  amended petition on the appropria te form, the Court will proceed \nwith an initial review of the amended petition. If  the amended petition fails to comply with Rule \n2(c) this matter will be dismisse d without prejudice and without furt her prior notice to Petitioner.  \n IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  that Jay Armbrister, Sh eriff of Douglas County, \nKansas, where Petitioner is conf ined in the Douglas County Jail , is substituted as the sole \nRespondent in this matter. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis \n(Doc. 2) is granted.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Petitioner is granted to and including November 4, \n2024 , in which to file an amended petition that compli es with this order.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The District Court for the District of Colorado, presided over by Judge Nina Y. Wang, reviewed the objections of Plaintiff Nonnie Berg against the magistrate judge's recommendation. The magistrate judge's ruling had denied Berg's motions to amend her complaint and granted a motion to strike certain filings due to procedural issues and misuse of generative artificial intelligence. The Court found no clear error in the magistrate's recommendations and dismissed Berg's objections, upholding the denial of her motions to amend.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the magistrate judge's recommendation to deny Plaintiff's motions to amend her complaint and grant the motion to strike certain of her filings was legally correct, and whether her objection was specific enough to merit review.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Court sided with the magistrate judge's findings, overruling Plaintiff's objection, denying her motions to amend the complaint due to procedural and substantive deficiencies, including misuse of generative AI, and maintaining the decision to strike her filings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're playing a board game with strict rules. Nonnie Berg, playing the game without a lawyer’s help, wanted to change her moves after making some mistakes. The game's referee (another judge) said she couldn't change those moves because she didn't follow the rules correctly, partly because she tried to use a computer tool in the wrong way. Another referee reviewed this decision and agreed that she couldn’t change her moves, and also noted that she should be careful about using faulty computer advice in the future.",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO  \nJudge Nina Y. Wang  \nCivil Action No. 2 3-cv-01766 -NYW -SBP \nNONNIE BERG , \n Plaintiff,  \nv.  \nUNITED AIRLINES, INC.,  \n \n Defendant.  \n \nORDER  \n \n \nThis matter is before the Court on the Order and Recommendation of United States \nMagistrate Judge , issued by the Honorable  Susan Prose on September 8 , 2025  (“Order \nand Recommendation”) .  [Doc. 118].  In the Order and Recommendation, Judge Prose \nrecommend ed that two identical iterations of Plaintiff’s “ Propose[d] Motion for Leave of \nCourt to Amend Complaint and Jury Demand ” (“Motions to Amend”) , [Doc. 95; Doc. 96 ], \nbe denied , [Doc. 118 at 17].  Judge Prose order ed that United’s  Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s \nResponses to Motion for Summary Judgment , [Doc. 91] , be granted, and that four of \nPlaintiff’s filings be  stricken , [Doc. 118 at 17 (striking [Doc. 84], [Doc. 85], [Doc. 86], and \n[Doc. 87])].  Judge Prose further ordered Plaintiff Nonnie Berg (“Plaintiff” or “Ms. Berg”) \nto file another response to Defendant’s  Motion for Summary Judgment and accordingly \ndenied as moot Plaintiff’s Motion [for] Leave to File Out of Time , [Doc. 99] , and Plaintiff’s \nPro Se Motion for Leave to File Corrected Opposition to Summary Judgment , [Doc. 108].  \nSee [Doc. 118 at 8, 17].   \nThe Order and Recommendation states that objections to the Order and Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 137     filed 10/30/25     USDC Colorado \npg 1 of 62 Recommendation must be filed within 14 days after its ser vice on the Parties.  [ Id. at 17 \nn.9]; see also  28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(2).  One day after the 14 -\nday deadline, Ms. Berg  filed a “Notice of Appeal” pursuant to “28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A),” \nstating that the “appeal is taken to the United States Court o[f] Appeals [f]or the Tenth \nCircuit.”  [Doc. 122 at 1].   Ms. Berg  “seeks review o [f] the Magistrate’s Order in its entirety \nand requests  that the Court o [f] Appeals reverse, vacate, and set aside the Order. ”  [Id. \nat 2].    \nBecause Ms. Berg  proceeds pro se , the Court must liberally construe her filings, \nincluding the Notice of Appeal.  Haines v. Kerner , 404 U.S. 519, 520 –21 (1972) (per \ncuriam).  But the Court cannot and does not act as her advocate, Hall v. Bellmon , 935 \nF.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991) , and Plaintiff remains bound by the same procedural \nrules and substantive law that apply to represented parties, see Murray v. City of \nTahlequah , 312 F.3d 1196, 1199 n.3 (10th Cir. 2002);  Dodson v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm ’rs, \n878 F. Supp. 2d 1227, 1236 (D. Colo. 201 2).   \nThe Court liberally construes the Notice of Appeal as an objection to Judge Prose’s \nOrder and Recommendation.  Although the Notice of Appeal is directed to the Tenth \nCircuit, it specifically seeks review of the Order and Recommendation  under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 636, the statute that governs the scope of a magistrate judge’s authority.  And i f the \nCourt treated the Notice of Appeal as  directly  appeal ing the Order and Recommendation  \nto the Tenth Circuit, such an appeal would likely be dismissed for lack of appellate \njurisdiction.  The Court referred this case to Judge Prose under 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A), \n[Doc. 10], and “[u]nder § 636(b)(1)(A), a magistrate judge may not issue a final order \ndirectly appealable to the court of appeals ,” Wheeler v. Am. Heritage Bank , 175 F. App’x Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 137     filed 10/30/25     USDC Colorado \npg 2 of 63 250, 252 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted); see also Stallings v. Ritter , 345 F. App’x \n366, 368 (10th Cir. 2009) (“A  pretrial order entered by a magistrate judge that has not \nbeen reviewed by the district court is generally not an appealable order .” (citing Phillips \nv. Beierwaltes , 466 F.3d 1217, 1222 (10th Cir. 2006)); Emrit v. Jules , No. 23 -3143 , 2023 \nWL 9600838 , at *1 (10th Cir. Aug. 15, 2023) (citing Phillips  and dismissing appeal of \nmagistrate judge’s recommendation for lack of jurisdiction).  Given  that Plaintiff’s Notice \nof Appeal can be “reasonably read” as a n objection, rather than a premature notice of \nappeal to the Tenth Circuit, the Court will liberally construe it and refer to it as an \n“Objection. ”  See Hall , 935 F.2d at 1110 & n.3.  The Court further notes that to the extent \nthat Ms. Berg wishes to appeal this Order to the Tenth Circuit, she may do so in \ncompliance with the applicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  \nI. Objection to Judge Prose’s Recommendation  \nWhen a party objects to a magistrate judge’s recommendation, the  district court \n“must determine de novo any part of the magistrate judge’s disposition that has been \nproperly objected to.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)(3).  “[A] party’s objections to the magistrate \njudge’s report and recommendation must be both timely and spec ific to preserve an issue \nfor de novo review by the district court or for appellate review.”  United States v. 2121 E. \n30th St. , 73 F.3d 1057, 1060 (10th Cir. 1996); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 7 2(b)(2) (permitting \na party to raise “specific written objections to the proposed findings and \nrecommendations”).  Such specific objections permit “the district judge to focus attention \non those issues —factual and legal —that are at the heart of the parties ’ dispute.”  2121 E. \n30th St. , 73 F.3d  at 1059 (quotation omitted).   Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 137     filed 10/30/25     USDC Colorado \npg 3 of 64 Here, however, Plaintiff’s Objection  does not identify any specific errors or issues \nin Judge Prose’s Recommendation.  Rather, she makes only the cursory request that the \nCourt review the Recommendation “in its entirety” and “reverse, vacate, and set aside” \nthe Recommendation.  [Doc. 122 at 2].  Put differently, Ms. Berg has expressed only a \ngeneral disagreement with the outcome of the Recommendation, instead of objecting to \nany particular finding of fact or conclusion of law.  Thus, the Objection  is insufficient to \ntrigger de novo review of Judge Prose’s recommendation.  2121 E. 30th St. , 73 F.3d  at \n1059 ; see also  Jenkins v. Haaland , No. 2:21 -cv-00385 -RJS-DAO, 2021 WL 6062369, at \n*6 (D. Utah Dec. 22, 2021) (declining to conduct de novo review when objection “fail[ed] \nto identify any specific legal or factual errors” in the recommendation) . \nIn the absence of a proper objection, the district court may review a magistrate \njudge’s recommendation under any standard it deems appropriate.  See Summers v. \nUtah , 927 F.2d 1165, 1167 (10th Cir. 1991); see also Thomas v. Arn , 474 U.S. 140, 150 \n(1985) (“It does not appear that Congress intended to require district court review of a \n[magistrate judge’s] factual or legal conclusions, under a de novo or any other standard, \nwhen neither party objects to those findings.”).  In this matter, the Court reviews the \nRecommendation and Order to satisfy itself that there is “no clear error on the face of the \nrecord.”1  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b), advisory committee’s note to 1983 amendment.  Based \non this review, the Court concludes that the Recommendation  that the pending Motions \nto Amend be denied , [Doc. 118 at 9 –15], is thorough, well -reasoned, and a correct \n \n1 This standard  of review  is something  less than a “clearly  erroneous  or . . . contrary  to \nlaw” standard of review, Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a), which in turn is less than a de novo  review, \nFed. R. Civ.  P. 72(b).  Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 137     filed 10/30/25     USDC Colorado \npg 4 of 65 application of the facts and the law.  The Objection  is respectfully OVERRULED , and the \nRecommendation is ADOPTED .  Ms. Berg’s Motions to Amend , [Doc. 95; Doc. 96] , are \nrespectfully DENIED .   \nII. Objection to Judge Prose’s Order  \nWhen a party objects to a magistrate judge’s nondispositive order, the district court \nmust “ modify or set aside any part of the order that is clearly erroneous or is contrary to \nlaw.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(a).  Although the Tenth Circuit has not addressed whether a \nparty’s objection to a magistrate judge’s nondispositive order must be “specific,” district \ncourts within the Tenth Circuit routinely interpret Rule 72(a) to require objections to be \n“specific .”  See, e.g. , Hawkins v. Ghiz , No. 2:18 -cv-00466 -DBB-JCB, 2021 WL 308238 , \nat *1 (D. Utah Jan. 29, 2021);  Gilmore v. L.D. Drilling, Inc. , No. 16 -cv-02416 -JAR-TJJ, \n2017 WL 5904034 , at *1 (D. Kan. Nov. 30, 2017); Marti n v. Henderson , No. 09 -cv-02574 -\nMSK -CBS, 2011 WL 864293 , at *2 (D. Colo. Mar. 10, 2011).  And Rule 72(a) expressly \nadvises litigants that “[a] party may not assign as error a defect in the order not timely \nobjected to.”   \nAs explained above, Plaintiff’s cursory request for review of the Order and \nRecommendation identifies no specific defects in Judge Prose’s order.  See [Doc. 122].  \nMoreover , the Court concurs with Judge Prose ’s determination  that the filings at issue are \nduplicative and untimely, violate this Court’s Civil P ractice Standards, and violate Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 11 through Ms. Berg’s continued misuse of  generative artificial \nintelligence.  See [Doc. 118 at 4 –7].  Ms. Berg is expressly advised that continued \ncitations to misstated or nonexistent legal authority may result in more severe \nsanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, up to and including a filing Case No. 1:23-cv-01766-NYW-SBP     Document 137     filed 10/30/25     USDC Colorado \npg 5 of 66 \nrestriction, monetary sanctions , and/or dismissal of this action .  See Morgan v. \nCmty. Against Violence , No. 23 -cv-00353-WPJ -JMR, 2023 WL 6976510 , at *7 –8 (D.N.M. \nOct. 23, 2023) (advising plaintiff that “her pro se status will not be tolerated by the Court \nas an excuse for failing to adhere to this Court ’s rules ,” and warning that “ future filings \nwith citations to nonexistent cases may result in sanctions such as the pleading being \nstricken, filing restrictions imposed, or the case being dismissed ” (emphasis omitted)).  \nAccordingly, Plain tiff’s Objection is respectfully OVERRULED .   \nCONCLUSION  \nAccordingly,  it is ORDERED  that: \n(1) The Order and  Recommendation of United States Magistrate Judge [Doc. \n118] is ADOPTED ;  \n(2) Plaintiff’s Notice of Appeal [Doc. 122] is CONSTRUED  as an objection to \nthe Order and Recommendation and OVERRULED ;  \n(3) Both iterations of Plaintiff’s “Propose[d] Motion for Leave of Court to Amend \nComplaint and Jury Demand” [Doc. 95; Doc. 96] are DENIED ; and  \n(4) The Clerk of Court is DIRECTED to mail a copy of this Order to Ms. Berg at \nthe following address:  \nNonnie Berg  \nP.O.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** Austin D. Martin, a defendant in a state criminal case for driving without insurance, attempted to remove his case to federal court, citing claims of unfair trial prospects in state court and procedural grievances. The U.S. District Court for the District of Hawai‘i denied Martin's motion for reconsideration, ruling that the removal notice was untimely and that the federal court lacked jurisdiction over the state prosecution. The case mentioned potential AI-generated documents containing fictitious citations, demonstrating the importance of verifying the accuracy of AI outputs in legal submissions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Martin's criminal prosecution case was rightfully removed from state court to federal court and whether the motion for reconsideration of the remand order was justified.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court denied Martin's motion for reconsideration as he failed to demonstrate an adequate basis for removal under federal law, and his claims did not satisfy the controlling legal standards. The court also highlighted issues with potentially AI-generated briefs containing fictitious information, which were not appropriately verified.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Austin tried to move his case about not having car insurance from a state to a federal court, arguing it wasn't fair. The federal judge said no because he didn't follow the right rules, like doing it on time, and the federal court wasn't allowed to take his kind of case anyway. Also, his paperwork seemed to have made-up things, possibly because he used a computer program to help him write it but didn’t check if it was correct.",

Martin, proceeding pro se, removed his state court criminal \nprosecution for driving without insurance fro m the State of Hawai‘i District Court \nof the Third Circuit to this Court.  ECF No . 1.  In an order dated July 24, 2024, this \nCourt concluded that Martin’s notice of removal was untimely, and, in any case, \nthat the Court lacked jurisdiction over Ma rtin’s state prosecution.  ECF No. 11.  \nAccordingly, the Court summarily rema nded the case back to state court.  Id.  \nMartin now moves for reconsideration of the remand order.  ECF No. 13. \nBecause Martin has not identified any basis for reconsideration, the Court \nDENIES the motion.

Such a \nmotion may be granted “only upon a showing of  (1) mistake, surprise, or excusable \nneglect; (2) newly discovered evidence; (3) fraud; (4) a void judgment; (5) a \nsatisfied or discharged judgment; or (6) extraordinary circumstances which would \njustify relief.”  Sch. Dist. No. 1J v. ACandS, Inc. , 5 F.3d 1255, 1263 (9th Cir. 1993) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also  Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).  Martin’s motion \ndoes not satisfy the high standard for reconsideration. \n1.  Martin contends, for the first tim e, that his notice of removal was not \nuntimely because he established good cau se for an extension under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1455(b)(1).  Under that statute, a noti ce of removal of a criminal prosecution \nmust “be filed not later than 30 days after the arraignment in the State court, or at \nany time before trial, whichever is earlie r, except that for good cause shown the \nUnited States district court may enter an order granting the defendant or defendants \nleave to file the notic e at a later time.”  Id.  Martin says that it “should be apparent \nfrom the record” that the ci rcumstances of this case would not have “permitted an \nearlier removal without risking a lack of removability for other reasons.”  ECF No. \n14, at PageID.148.  But Martin  offers no elaboration on th is conclusory statement.  \nAnd the basis for his assertion is not othe rwise apparent.  This is not enough to Case 1:24-cv-00294-MWJS-WRP   Document 16   Filed 08/20/24   Page 2 of 7  PageID.<pageID>3 \n establish good cause for an extension, le t alone establish that the Court should \nreconsider its earlier order. \nAs a separate argument, Ma rtin says he should have been given an extension \nbecause he is pro se, and enforcing the time limit would deny him access to \nremoval.  Id.  The Court acknowledges Martin’s pr o se status, but that alone does \nnot suffice as good cause under the circumstan ces here.  And in any case, the Court \nprovided an alternative basis for remand in its order:  even if Martin’s notice of \nremoval had been timely, the Court lacked jurisdiction over his state criminal case. \n2.  Martin also challenges the Cour t’s jurisdictional assessment.  He \ncontends that the remand order interpre ted the jurisdictional bounds of 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1443(1) too narrowly.  At bottom, Martin  appears to believe that removal is \nrequired because he would not be able to obtain a fair tr ial in state court.  But \nremoval under § 1443(1) is not as freely gran ted as Martin suggests.  To support a \n§ 1443(1) removal, it is not enough to allege that a defendant “is unable to obtain a \nfair trial in a partic ular state court.”  City of Greenwood v. Peacock , 384 U.S. 808, \n827 (1966).  Rather, as explained in the remand order, a petitioner must satisfy a \nspecific two part-test.  Patel v. Del Taco, Inc. , 446 F.3d 996, 999 (9th Cir. 2006).  \nA petitioner must assert (1) “as a defense to  the prosecution, rights that are given to \nthem by explicit statutory enactment protec ting equal racial civil rights”; and (2) \n“that the state courts will not enforce th at right, and that allegation must be Case 1:24-cv-00294-MWJS-WRP   Document 16   Filed 08/20/24   Page 3 of 7  PageID.<pageID>4 \n supported by reference to a state statute or a constitutional provision that purports \nto command the state courts to ignore the federal rights.”  Id. \nMartin acknowledges that this test is not satisfied here.  He concedes that the \nclaims asserted in his notice of removal “a re not consistent with those outlined in \nthe two-part test” identified in the rema nd order.  ECF No. 13, at PageID.143.  \nBecause Martin has admittedly not satisfied  the applicable jurisdictional test, the \nCourt does not have jurisdiction over hi s state criminal case under § 1443(1). \nMartin suggests, however, that there is “evidence of a secret trial” that he \nbelieves would “satisfy[] even the strictes t interpretation” of the test’s second \nprong.  ECF No. 13, at PageID.144.  Bu t Martin still identifies no right given to \nhim by a statute protecting equal racial civil rights, nor does he identify a state \nstatute or constitutional provision purporti ng to command the state courts to ignore \nthat right.  See Patel , 446 F.3d at 999.  Because his assertion about “evidence of a \nsecret trial” still does not provide a juri sdictional basis for removal, it is not \ngrounds for reconsideration. \nNext, Martin asserts that the Court was required to hold an evidentiary \nhearing to determine the truth of his a llegations before rema nding his case.  ECF \nNo. 14, at PageID.148-49.  That is not corr ect.  The controlling statute requires this \nCourt to summarily remand the case “[i ]f it clearly appears on the face of the \nnotice and any exhibits annexed thereto th at removal should not  be permitted.”  28 Case 1:24-cv-00294-MWJS-WRP   Document 16   Filed 08/20/24   Page 4 of 7  PageID.<pageID>5 \n U.S.C. § 1455(4).  Only if the appropriat eness of remand is unclear from the face \nof the notice of removal may the Court hold an evidentia ry hearing on the matter.  \nId. § 1455(5).  Where, as here , the notice of removal is cl early deficient, the Court \nproperly remands the case without a hearing. \nMartin further argues that “[r]em oval statutes should be construed \ngenerously to protect federal rights.”  ECF No. 13, at PageID.145.  But as the \nCourt noted in its remand order, the Nint h Circuit has taken the opposite view:  it \nhas instructed that removal statutes are to  be “strictly constr ued, and a defendant \nseeking removal has the burden to esta blish that removal is proper.”  Hawai‘i ex \nrel. Louie v. HSBC Bank Nev. , 761 F.3d 1027, 1034 (9th  Cir. 2014) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  “[A]ny doubt is resolved against removability.”  Id. \nThe Court did liberally construe Martin’s notice of removal; that is because \ncourts “have a duty to construe pro se pleadings liberally, including pro se motions \nas well as complaints.”  Bernhardt v. Los Angeles County , 339 F.3d 920, 925 (9th \nCir. 2003).  But the Court has no power to construe a statute  more broadly merely \nbecause a party seeking relief under the st atute is proceeding pro se.  And it was \nclear from the face of Martin’s notice th at the Court does not have jurisdiction \nunder § 1443(1).1  Remand was therefore required.  \n \n1 To the extent that Martin invokes subsection (2) of § 1443, see ECF No. 13, \nat PageID.143-44 (mentioning the “color of  authority” prong), that subsection also \n Case 1:24-cv-00294-MWJS-WRP   Document 16   Filed 08/20/24   Page 5 of 7  PageID.<pageID>6 \n *          *          * \n As a final matter, the Court notes that many of the citations and quotes in \nMartin’s submissions appear to be fictitious.  See, e.g. , ECF No. 13, at PageID.145 \n(providing the citation of Crenshaw v. City of Defuniak Springs , 891 F.3d 1338 \n(11th Cir. 2018)); ECF No. 14, at PageID.149 (quoting Morford v. United States , \n339 U.S. 258, 260 (1950), for the proposition that  “[w]here a defendant is able to \nestablish that an impartial judge is unavail able . . . any later proceedings in state \ncourt would fail to afford the petitione r the equal protection of the laws); id. at \nPageID.157 (quoting Holley v. Lavine , 553 F.2d 845 (2d Cir. 1977), for the \nproposition that the time limit for removal should be construed liberally to prevent \nit from becoming a “trap for the unwary”); id. (providing the citation of Huffman v. \nBright , 636 F. Supp. 133 (D. Colo. 1986)).   None of these citations—not \nCrenshaw , Morford , Holley , or Huffman , to name but a few—is accurate, and the \nproffered quotations appear to  be fictitious.  It is possi ble that Martin used an \nartificial intelligence (AI) product to generate his briefs.  If so, he is cautioned that \nhe is required to confirm the accuracy of  all case citations  and quotes before \nsubmitting them.  In addition, in future su bmissions in which he has made use of \n \ndoes not provide a basis for removal of his state criminal case, for it “is available \nonly to federal officers and to persons assi sting such officers in the performance of \ntheir official duties.”  Peacock , 384 U.S. at 815.  Martin does not suggest he is \neither of those. Case 1:24-cv-00294-MWJS-WRP   Document 16   Filed 08/20/24   Page 6 of 7  PageID.<pageID>7 \n AI, he must submit a declaration therewith that (1) discloses his reliance on AI and \n(2) verifies that he has confirmed that the materials generate d are not fictitious.  \nSee United States District Court for the Dist rict of Hawai‘i, General Order 23-1, In \nRe: Use of Unverified Sources (Nov. 14, 2023). \nBecause Martin’s motion for reconsider ation is denied, the Court does not \ntake action on the matter at this time.  Bu t Martin is cautioned that the future \nsubmission of fabricated materials—by a human author or AI—or the failure to \ndisclose reliance on AI c ould result in sanctions.  See id. ; Fed. R. Civ.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This court case involves a wrongful birth claim filed by Jane Doe against Xytex Corporation and its associates, claiming they misrepresented the educational and health background of sperm donor James Aggeles, resulting in the birth of her child. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, stating that Georgia law does not recognize wrongful birth claims, which the plaintiff's claims fundamentally constitute. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is mentioned as part of Aggeles' false educational background, AI itself wasn't directly relevant to the court's decision.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue is whether the plaintiff's claims can proceed under Georgia law as a wrongful birth claim.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that wrongful birth claims are not recognized under Georgia law and dismissed the plaintiff's complaint, as the essence of her claim was that her child would not have been born had the truth been known about the sperm donor's history.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** A woman sued a sperm bank because the donor she chose was misrepresented as an educated and healthy man, but he wasn’t. She believed the company misled her and now her child suffers as a result. However, Georgia law doesn't allow lawsuits for wrongful birth, meaning you can't sue just because you wished a child hadn't been born. Thus, the court dismissed her case.",

The individual Defendants were associated with the Atlanta office\nof Xytex in various ways.1 \nOn October 18, 2000, James Aggeles applied to be a sperm donor with Xytex.2\nOn his application, Aggeles claimed that  he had a Bachelor’s Degree, a Master’s\nDegree, and that he was working towa rd his Ph.D. in artificial intelligence.3 None of\nthis was true, however, as Aggeles had act ually dropped out of school at that time.4\nPrior to applying to be a sperm donor, Aggeles had also been hospitalized and\ndiagnosed with psychotic schizophrenia,  narcissistic personality disorder, and\nsignificant grandiose delusions.5 But during Aggeles’ first visit to Xytex, the\nDefendant Hartley suggested to him that more educated donors did better selling their\nsperm.6 As a result, Aggeles filled out his application falsely by inflating his\neducational background and lying about his mental health history.7\n1Compl. ¶¶ 1-9.\n2Id. at ¶ 12.\n3Id. at ¶ 13.\n4Id. at ¶ 22.\n5Id. at ¶ 21.\n6Id. at ¶ 22.\n7Id.\n-2- T:\\ORDERS\\16\\Doe\\16cv1729\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:16-cv-01729-TWT   Document 31   Filed 03/17/17   Page 2 of 8Despite Xytex’s claim that all applicants went through a rigorous qualification\nprocedure that takes months to complete, including a medical review and regularupdates to their medical and criminal hi stories, Aggeles was approved as a donor\nwithin two weeks.\n8 The Complaint alleges that he was only given a ten minute\nphysical examination, during which no physical or mental health history wasdiscussed.\n9 After Aggeles was a pproved as a sperm donor, he was hospitalized\nnumerous times for mental h ealth reasons, and was arre sted on numerous occasions.10\nBetween 2000 and 2016, Aggeles becam e one of Xytex’s most popular\ndonors.11 Families often desired the sperm of highly educated and accomplished\npeople, and Xytex promoted Aggeles as such a donor  based upon the information in\nhis application. During those years, Aggele s became the biological father of at least\nthirty-six children through Xytex’s sale of his sperm, including the Plaintiff’s child.12 \nThe Plaintiff, a single woman from Ohio ,  had first heard about Xytex through\nan internet search, and after some res earch, decided that using sperm from Xytex\n8Id. at ¶¶ 18, 23.\n9Id. at ¶ 23.\n10Id. at ¶ 24.\n11Id. at ¶ 25.\n12Id.\n-3- T:\\ORDERS\\16\\Doe\\16cv1729\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:16-cv-01729-TWT   Document 31   Filed 03/17/17   Page 3 of 8would be her best available option to have  a child. The Plaintiff then called Xytex\ndirectly and requested to view sperm donor profiles. A Xytex representative sent the\nPlaintiff a variety of profiles, including that of Aggeles. When she came across\nAggeles’ donor profile, known as Donor #9623, sh e was intrigued because he was\nrepresented to be educated and healthy. The Plaintiff th en called Xytex again to ask\nfor more information. A Xytex represen tative responded that Aggeles’ sperm was\nextremely popular and had been successful in achieving pregnancy. As a result of\nXytex’s representations, the Plaintiff purchas ed Aggeles’ sperm and gave birth to her\nchild, who is now approximately nine years old.13 \nIn June of 2014, Xytex in advertently disclosed A ggeles’ identity, and the\nPlaintiff was then able to discover much of  Aggeles’ educational and criminal history\nthrough a simple internet search.14 As a result, the Plaintiff filed the Complaint on\nMay 27, 2016, alleging eleven different causes of action against the Defendants,\nincluding fraud, negligence, and breach of  warranty.

Discussion\nThe Defendants’ primary argument is that  all of the Plaintiff’s claims are\nderivative of a wrongful birth action, a nd because wrongful birth claims are not\nrecognized in Georgia, the Plaintiff’s claims  must be dismissed. In other words, the\nDefendants argue that all of the Plaintiff’s claims fundamentally stand on the assertion\nthat if the Plaintiff had known the truth a bout Aggeles, the Plaintiff’s child would not\nhave been born. The Plaintiff, for her part , argues that this case is not one for wrongful\nbirth , but rather for wrongful conception .\nIn Georgia, wrongful conception claims generally arise when a sterilization or\nabortion procedure goes wrong and a live birth unintentionally results.20 In such a\ncase, the measure of damages allows “r ecovery of expenses for the unsuccessful\nmedical procedure which led to concepti on or pregnancy, fo r pain and suffering,\nmedical complications, costs of delivery,  lost wages, and loss of consortium.”21   By\ncontrast, wrongful birth claims normally ar ise when the parents contend they would\nhave aborted the child if they had been fully aware of the child’s condition.22 While\nwrongful conception claims have been allowe d in Georgia, wrongful birth claims have\n20Fulton-DeKalb Hosp. Auth. v. Graves , 252 Ga. 441, 442 (1984).\n21Id. at 443.\n22Atlanta Obstetrics & Gynecology Grp. v.

According to the Plaintiff, when the\nwrong occurs before conception and directly causes the harm, as in failed sterilization\ncases, the tort is allowed. And when the wrong occurs after conception and indirectly\ncauses the harm, as in failure-to-di agnose cases, the tort is disallowed.\nThe Plaintiff is incorrect. The reason why Georgia courts have looked on\nwrongful birth claims with disfavor is not because of the timing of the tort or the\ncausal link between the defendant and the ha rm.  The true differe nce between the two\ntorts is the measure of damages. Wrongful birth claims are disfavored because they\nrequire the court to decide between the va lue of a life with disabilities and the value\nof no life at all. The Georgia courts are “unwilling to say that life, even life with\nsevere impairments, may ever amount to a legal injury.”24 In this case, the Plaintiff\nessentially claims that had the Defendant s been truthful with her about Aggeles’\nhistory, she would not have used his sper m and her child would not have been born. \n23Id. at 714; Campbell v. United States , 962 F. 2d 1579, 1583 (11th Cir.\n1992) (“In the instant case, while Georgia ha s a statute which permits injured parties\nto recover for medical malpractice committe d by private parties, this statute does not\npermit recovery for the tort called wrongful birth.”).\n24Abelson , 260 Ga.  at 715.\n-7- T:\\ORDERS\\16\\Doe\\16cv1729\\mtdtwt.wpdCase 1:16-cv-01729-TWT   Document 31   Filed 03/17/17   Page 7 of 8The Plaintiff attempts to mask this tr uth by describing the Defendants as having\n“exposed Plaintiff’s [sic] and her child  to [Aggeles’] traits through their\nmisrepresentations.”25 But a genetic disease is not the same as a virus or a bacteria.\nAvoiding “exposure” to Aggeles’ various ment al health problems would not mean the\nPlaintiff’s child would be healthier; it woul d mean her child would not exist. This is\na wrongful birth claim, and it is not allowe d in a diversity case applying Georgia law. \nIV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case centers on a dispute between Aaron M. Ogletree and Cleveland State University over the university's practice of conducting room scans before remote examinations. Ogletree contended that these scans, which involved using a student's camera to check for impermissible aids during a remote test, violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The court, analyzing the privacy expectations in a student's home and the absence of a sufficiently pressing need for such invasive measures, found in favor of Ogletree, ruling that room scans constitute an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the room scans conducted by Cleveland State University during remote examinations constitute an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the room scans conducted by Cleveland State University are indeed searches under the Fourth Amendment and are unreasonable.

( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #268.)  \nA required procedure mandates that students taking online classes have a \nphotograph in Cleveland State’s database  at the time of registration  so as “to \neliminate impersonation and to ensure that the same student enrolled in the course \nis attending the online lectures and taking  the exams.”  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID \n#273– 74; ECF No.  25-2, PageID #330.)  However, Cleveland State does not enforce \nthis procedure , and some students taking online classes do not have a photograph in \nthe database.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #272– 74.) \nIn addition to requir ed procedures, the University’s recommended practices \nleave testing “to the faculty member’s discretion to implement.”  (ECF No. 25 -2, \nPageID #331.)   Some recommended practices include randomiz ing the order of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  2 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>3 questions, us ing timed tests, and using  remote proctoring tools.  (Id., PageID \n#331– 32.)   \nAs remote proctoring tools, Cleveland State offers several programs  desig ned \nto enhance  “online test security and proctoring.”  ( Id., PageID #332.)  For instance, \nCleveland State’s  learning management system , Blackboard , offers a plagiarism \ndetection system  and generates  reports “that faculty can use to see more information \nabout student activity, including  the IP address from where they logged in, how much \ntime they spent in the exam .”  (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #262– 63 & 312.)  Cleveland \nState also uses the proctoring tools Rospondus  and Honorlock.  ( Id., PageID # 291.)   \nFor Respondus, Respondus LockDown Browser prevents students from accessing the \ninternet or using other computer programs during a remote test, while Rospondus \nMonitor records the student taking the exam and uses artificial  intelligence to flag \nsuspicious activ ity.  (Id., PageID # 305– 06 & 321.)  Similarly, Honorlock uses a \nstudent’s camera  and artificial intelligence monitoring.   (Id., PageID #299.)   Among \nthese remote proctoring tools, faculty members have discretion to choose which tool \nor combination of tools , if any, are necessary to preserve the integrity of the remote \nexam.  ( Id., PageID #275– 76 & 295.) \nB. Cleveland State ’s Use of Room Scans  \nCleveland State neither requires nor  recommends the use of a room scan  \npursuant to any written policy .  (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #277.)   In a non- proctored \nexam, there is no room scan.  ( Id., PageID #283.)   However, each of the online \nproctoring tools that Cleveland State  uses, Respondus and Honorlock, requires a Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  3 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>4 room scan as part of its prerecorded instructions.  ( Id., PageID #291– 93.)  In  in-person \nproctored exams , the test coordinator at Cleveland State University  Testing Services \ninformed Mr. Ogletree by email that it has a process of performing a “cursory review \nof [the student’s] immediate testing space,” and “[a]ll  students, regardless of the \ncourse or instructor, are asked to do this as part of the check -in process.”   (ECF No. \n26-7, PageID #413.)    \nWhen a student takes an o nline exam , it proceeds as follows.  First, at the \noutset of a  proctored online exam, whether  proctored through an electronic \napplication or an actual person, students must “show their ID next to their face so \nyou can clearly see and read the ID and be able to tell that that person is the same person that is on the ID.”  (ECF No.  25-1, PageID #282 ; ECF No. 24 -1\n, PageID #202.)   \nSecond , either the proctoring application or the proctor prompts  the student to \nconduct a room scan of his  environment.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #282; ECF No. 24 -1, \nPageID #211 .)  Other students taking the remote test can see the room scans of other \nstudents.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #212.)  \nThe proctor who performed the room scan at issue in this case testified that \nher supervisor , the Cleveland State Testing Services ’ test coordinato r, instructed her \nto perform the room scan.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #214.)  Further, the proctor \npresumed that a room scan was required unless the professor in the class instructed \notherwise.  ( Id., PageID #215.)  As to whether students may refuse to conduc t the \nroom scan, the proctor testified that she never had a student refuse , and she was not \naware of a Cleveland State policy addressing how to handle a student’s refusal.  ( Id., Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  4 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>5 PageID #213.)   The proctor testified that in the event of a refusal, she would allow \nthe student to take the test but notify the professor that the student refused to \nperform the room scan.  ( Id.) \nC. Mr. Ogletree’s Enrollment at Cleveland State  \n At the time of the events relevant to this action, Mr. Ogletree studied \nchemistry at Cleve land State University.  ( ECF No. 26- 1, PageID #352.)  For the \nspring 2021 semester , Mr. Ogletree enr olled in five classes.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 39,  \nPageID #1 49–50.)  Due to the Covi d-19 pandemic, most Cleveland State classes \nduring the spring 2021 semester were  conducted remotely.  ( ECF No. 1 , ¶ 40, PageID \n#150; ECF No.  19, ¶ 40, PageID #163.)    \nIn the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that during the spring 2021 semester, \nCleveland State required students to complete and pass a “Daily Health Assessment” \nto attend a class in -person  on campus .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 42,  PageID #150.)   Attending \nclasses in person was not an option for him, Plaintiff says, because of “various health issues that impact his immune system and put him at particular risk to the COVID pandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 45, PageID #150.)   Further, “[b]ecause of his health issues, \nOgletree does not pass the Daily Health Assessment” ; therefore , Cleveland State  \nwould not permit him to take his tests in -person on campus .  (Id., ¶¶ 46 & 47 , PageID \n#150.)   Plaintiff also alleged he has “family members who are at high -risk to the \npandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 48, PageID #150.)  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  5 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>6 D. The Room Scan  \nIn January 2021, Mr. Ogletree disputed a policy contained in the syllabus for \nhis General Chemistry II class.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 49, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 49, \nPageID #164.)   The policy stated:   “The proctors and I reserve the right to ask any \nstudent, before, during, or after an exam to show their surroundings, screen, and/or \nwork area.  We will send you a private chat to ask you  to do this.  If you do not see \nthe chat message, I will use the microphone to ask you to check the chat.”  ( Id.)  Three \ndays later, the Professor removed the  policy  from the syllabus .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 50, \nPageID  #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 50, PageID #164.)   \n On February 17, 2021, Mr. Ogletree had a General Chemistry II remote test \nscheduled for 12:30 pm.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 51, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 51, PageID \n#164.)  At the time, Mr. Ogletree lived with his mother an d two siblings, who were all \nhome when Mr. Ogletree took the chemistry exam.  ( ECF No. 26 -1, PageID #354– 55.)  \nCleveland State requires students to take remote tests in a location where they will \nbe alone and uninterrupted.  ( ECF No. 17 , PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , PageID #165.)  \nMr. Ogletree testified that his bedroom was the only suitable testing environment.  (\nECF No. 26 -1, PageID #366.)   \nThat morning, at 10:25 am, almost two hours before scheduled exam, \nCleveland State Testing Services emailed Mr. Ogletree to inform him the proctor \nwould be “checking your ID, your surroundings and your materials.”  ( ECF No. 26 -5, \nPageID #4 09.)  At 10:40 am, Mr. Ogletree replied to the email.  ( Id.)  Mr. Ogletree \nexplained that he “currently [had] confidential settlement do cuments in the form of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  6 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>7 late arriving 1099s scattered about [his] work area and there is not enough time to \nsecure them.”  ( Id.)  \n At the start of the exam, the proctor asked Mr. Ogletree to perform a room scan \nof his bedroom , and Mr. Ogletree complied .  (ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #226.)  The scan \nlasted less than a minute , and as little as ten to twenty seconds .  (Id., PageID #227 ; \nECF No. 26 -1, PageID #368.)  The proctor testified that she did not see any tax \ndocuments or medications.   (ECF No.  24-1, PageID #239 –40.) \n The room scan and the test were recorded,  and the video recording was \nretained by Cleveland State’s third -party  vendor.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301.)  \nCleveland State is not aware of any dat a breaches related to remote exam  recordings , \nand access to the video is strictly controlled.   (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301 ; ECF No. \n24-1, PageID #236– 37.) \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n Based on these facts, Plaintiff  alleges  that Defendant violated his rights under  \nthe Fourth Amendment and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief.  ( ECF No. 17 , \nPageID #152 –53.)  Both Plaintiff and Defendant move  for summary judgment.   (ECF \nNos. 29 & 30.)  \nANALYSIS \nPursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary \njudgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.  R. \nCiv. P. 56(a).  On a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view evidence in Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  7 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>8 the light most favorable to the non -moving party.  Kirilenko -Ison v. Board of Educ. of \nDanville Indep. Schs., 974 F.3d 652, 660 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Matsushita Elec. \nIndus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp ., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)).  Ultimately, the \nCourt mu st determine whether “one party must prevail as a matter of law.”  Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 242, 251 (1986) .   \nI. Fourth Amendment  Searches  \nThe Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.”  \nU.S. Const. amend. IV; United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 404 (2012).  Plaintiff \ncontends t hat Cleveland State’s policy of conducting warrantless room scans of \nstudents’ homes violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable \nsearches as it applies to the State of Ohio through the Fourteenth Amendment.  ( ECF \nNo. 17 , PageID #153.)   \n At the outset, the parties contest whether the remote virtual room scans at \nissue qualify as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Specifically, \nthey debate whether the Fourth Amendment applies under Wyman v. James, 400 \nU.S. 309 (1971), and its progeny.   \nI.A. General  Principles \n A Fourth Amendment search “occurs when the government violates a \nsubjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.”  Kyllo v. \nUnited States , 533 U.S. 27, 33 (2001) (citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361 \n(1967) ).  Even in the expressly  protected location of a house, which receives Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  8 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>9 heightened protection under the Fourth Amendment, a  search within the meaning of \nthe Constitution does not occur unless “the individual manifested a subje ctive \nexpectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,” and society is “willing \nto recognize that expectation as reasonable.”  Id.  (citing California v. Ciraolo , 47 U.S. \n207, 211 (1986)).  \nPlaintiff contends  that the  remote  room  scans at issue are Fourth Amendment \nsearches because students have a subjective expectation of privacy in their houses , \nand especially in their bedrooms, and society recognizes that expectation as \nreasonable.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #499.)  In response, Defendant maintains  that \nPlaintiff’s subjective expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable.   (ECF \nNo. 34, PageID #512.)   Defendant points to evidence showing that room  scans are \n“standard industry wide practice” and that students frequently acquiesce in  their use.  \n(ECF No. 34 , PageID #512– 14.)   \nAlthough the record shows that no student, other than Mr. Ogletree, ever \nobjected to the scans ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #213), the facts  also implicate the core \nplaces where society, to the extent it can agree on much  these days , recognizes \nreasonable and legitimate privacy interests —namely, the home.  Though schools may \nroutinely employ remote technology to peer into houses without objection from some, \nmost, or nearly  all students, it does not follow that others might  not object to the \nvirtual intrusion into their homes or that the routine use of a practice such as room scans does not violate a privacy interest that society recognizes  as reasonable, both \nfactually and legally.  Therefore, the Court determines that Mr. Ogletree’s subjective Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  9 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>10 expectation of privacy at issue is one that society views as reasonable and that lies at \nthe core of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against governmental intrusion.  \nTo support the argument that the expectation of privacy Plaintiff claims is \nobjectively unreasonable, Defendant relies on several  cases.  First , Defendant argues \nthat the room  scans are  not searches because they are  routine .  For this proposition, \nDefendant cites California v. Ciraolo , 476 U.S. 207, 215 (1986) , in which the Supreme \nCourt held that it was unreasonable to expect that marijuana plants were \nconstitutionally protected from being observed from an altitude of 1,000 feet “in an age where private and commercial  flight in the public airways is routine.”   See also \nFlorida v. Riley , 488 U.S. 445, 449– 50 (1989) (same).  In Ciraolo and Riley , due to  \nmodern  flight  technology and its routine use, the marijuana plants were  openly  \nobservable.   These cases build on the traditional notion that governmental officials,  \nlawfully in a public place, do not conduct unlawful searches simply by  observ ing \nthings  in plain view.  But the room scans peer behind walls and make visible places \noutside the ambit of cases such as Ciraolo and Riley .  Rooms scans go where people \notherwise would not, at least not without a warrant or an invitation.  \nNor does it follow that room  scans are not searches because the technolog y is \n“in general public use.”  Defendant cites Kyllo , 533 U.S. at 34– 40, in which the \nSupreme Court held that law enforcement’s use of thermal imaging technology  not \n“in general public use” to explore the interior of the home constituted a Fourth \nAmendment search .  But t he Supreme Court did not  hold the inverse —that the use \nof a technology “in gene ral public use”  could not be a Fourth Amendment search.   To Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  10 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>11 the contrary, Katz  held, as relevant here, that the procedural antecedents to a search \nthat the Constitution requires apply even where new technologies make accessible \nplaces and information not o therwise obtainable without a physical intrusion.   389 \nU.S. at 359.   While cameras  might  be generally available and now commonly used , \nmembers of the  public cannot use  them  to see into a n office, house, or other place not \npublicly visible without the owner’s consent.   \nFinally, Defendant cites  City of Ontario, California v. Quon , 560 U.S. 746  \n(2010), in which the Supreme Court considered the privacy  expectations of \ngovernmental employees in communications made on electronic equipment  that the \nemployer  owns .  T here, t he Court observed that rapid changes related to \ncommunications were evident in both the technology and “what society accepts as \nproper behavior” and noted that the “operational realities of the workplace” might \nbear on the reason ableness of employees’ expectation of privacy.   Id. at 756– 59.  But \nQuon arose within the  particular context of the employment relationship .  Although \nthe truism that technological change affects the degree of privacy that society accepts \nas reasonable has  broader application, Quon  and the cases that followed it have not \nextended this principle beyond the employment context.  Any decision to do so \nproperly lies with another court , particularly if doing so pares back constitutional \nprotections across differe nt areas of the law .   \nFollowing Katz , Fourth Amendment jurisprudence examines an individual’s \nexpectation of privacy in a particular place .  The ubiquity  of a particular  technolog y \nor its application s does not directly bear on that analysis .  Here, the room  scan Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  11 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>12 occurred in Plaintiff’s house, in his bedroom, in fact .  At the Fourth Amendment’s \n“very core” lies “ the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from \nunreasonable governmental intrusion.”  Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. 1, 6 (2013) \n(citing Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511 (1961) ).  Consistent with \nestablished precedent, the Court determines that Plaintiff  had an objectively \nreasonable expectation of privacy in his home—and one that society recognizes as \nreasonable .  \nI.B. Searches Under Wyman  v. James  \nAdditionally , Defendant  contends that the room  scans are not “searches” \nbecause they are limited in scope, conducted for a regulatory or administrative \npurpose, and not coerced.   (ECF No. 29 , PageID #46 2–66.)  In support of the \nproposition that these attributes remove the room  scans from the ambit of the Fourth \nAmendment, Defendant relies on Wyman v. James , 400 U.S. 309 (1971) , and its \nprogeny.  \n In Wyman , the Supreme C ourt considered whether a welfare beneficiary may \nrefuse a home visit by her  caseworker without risking the termination of benefits.  \n400 U.S. at 310.   The Wyman Court specifically considered the heightened  protection \nthe Fourth Amendment affords to the privacy of the home  and noted that “one’s  \nFourth Amendment protection subsists apart from his being suspected of criminal \nbehavior .”  Id. at 316 (citing Camara v. Municipal Ct ., 387 U.S. 523, 528– 30 (1967)) .  \nNonetheless, t he Court held  that this “protective  attitude” in the law was not a factor \nin the case because the home visit was not a search in the Fourth Amendment sense .  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  12 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>13 Id. at 318.  Though  State law made the visit mandatory for continu ing benefits  and \nthe visit served both rehabilitative and investiga tive purposes , the Court concluded  \nthat the visit could not be equated with a search in the traditional criminal law \ncontext.  Id.   Indeed , the visit was not forced or compelled, the beneficiary’s denial of \npermission was not a criminal ac t, and if the beneficiary did  not consent then the \nvisitation did not occur and the aid “merely cease [d].”  Id. \n The other cases Defendant cites stem from Wyman .  In S.L. v. Whitburn, 67 \nF.3d 1299, 1307 (7th Cir. 1995) , and Sanchez v. C ity of San Diego , 464 F.3d 916, \n920– 23 (9th Cir. 2006) , the Seventh and Ninth Circuit s noted  that they were bound \nby Wyman  and held  that home visits made pursuant to the administration of welfare \nbenefits  were not searches under the Fourth Amendment.   See also  Schmid v. City of \nSonoma , No. 19 -cv-00883, 2021 WL 1118077, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2021)  \n(upholding denial of an exemption for refusal to consent to a permit -related inspection \non the grounds that the inspections were not Fourth Amendment searches unde r \nWyman ).  Similarly, in Marcavage v. Borough of Lansdowne, P ennsylvania , 493 F. \nApp’x 301 (3d Cir. 2012) , the court upheld an ordinance  authorizing denial of a rental \nlicense if the property owner refused to consent to an inspection .  The Third Circuit \nreasoned that the ordinance “requires a limited search by the city official for the \nspecific purpose of receiving a benefit under the law,”  which is constitutional under \nWyman .  Id.  at 306.  \n Based on Wyman ’s differentiation between investigations and Fourth \nAmendment searches, Defendant advances several reasons why its room  scans of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  13 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>14 students’ homes are not searches.  First, Defendant conducted the scan for the \nregulatory purpose of protecting exam integrity , not for any purpose related to \ncriminality.  ( ECF No. 29 , PageID #463.)  Second, the scan was not coerced because \nPlaintiff was free to object to the scan or refuse to perform it.  ( Id.)  A student who \nrefused to conduct the exam could still take the tes t, and e ven if failure to conduct \nthe scan resulted in not getting credit for the exam, that consequence is  less severe \nthan the loss of  welfare benefits in Wyman .  (Id., PageID #464– 65.)  Third, the scan \nwas limited in scope because it was brief , only rev ealed items in plain view , and the \nstudent controlled the inspection to the extent that the student chose where in the \nhouse to take the exam and where in the room to direct the camera  during the scan.  \n(Id., PageID #463– 64.)  Defendant argues that the room  scan was less intrusive than \nthe home visits in Wyman  because no State officer physically entered Plaintiff’s home, \nDefendant told Plaintiff of the scan two hours in advance, and Plaintiff could choose the part of the home  to be inspected and remove any  private matters from plain view.  \n(Id., PageID #464. )   \n Plaintiff responds that Defendant overreads Wyman .  (ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#500.)   Plaintiff points to the Sixth Circuit’s holding in Andrews v. Hickman County, \nTennessee , 700 F.3d 845 (6th Cir. 2012).  There, the court considered whether social \nworkers who conducted a warrantless home visit in a child abuse investigation were \nentitled to qualified immunity.  The Sixth Circuit noted that the Fourth Amendment’s restrictions on  unreasonable searches extended to the “activities of civil as well as \ncriminal authorities.”  Id. at 858– 59 (citing New Jersey v. T.L.O ., 469 U.S. 325, 335 Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  14 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>15 (1985) ).  Describing case law from other circuits , the c ourt referenced a case in which \nthe Ninth Circuit declined to exempt social workers investigating allegations of child \nabuse from the Fourth Amendment by distinguishing Wyman as mak ing “receipt of \na requested welfare benefit contingent on the grant of entr y for a search intended to \nconfirm that the monies were being used in the recipient child ’s interest, where the \nentry under the state program was of a limited and consensual nature, and the \nrequirement applied to all recipients .”  Id.  at 859 (citing Calabretta v. Floyd , 189 F.3d \n808, 816 (9th Cir. 1999) ).  “Given the presumption that state actors are governed by \nthe Fourth Amendment and the sanctity of the home under the Fourth Amendment,” \nthe Sixth Circuit held  that social workers were governed by the Four th Amendment’s \nwarrant requirement.   700 F.3d at 859.  \n Plaintiff argues that Andrews shows that Wyman did not create a Fourth \nAmendment exception for civil authorities.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #501.)   Rather, \nlongstanding  precedent establishes that the Fourt h Amendment applies to searches \nconducted for noncriminal purposes , especially in the home.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#501– 02.)  Further, Plaintiff maintains that it is well  establishe d that the Fourth \nAmendment applies to all intrusions into a private home, however limited.  ( Id., \nPageID #50 2–03.)  Defendant does not dispute that the Fourth Amendment  gives \nheightened protection to  the home or that the Fourth Amendment applies in \nnoncriminal matters.  ( ECF No. 35 , PageID #533.)   However, Defendant argues  that \nthe Wyman Court considered both of those points and , nonetheless , determined that \nno Fourth Amendment search occurred.  ( Id.) Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  15 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>16  Wyman  dates to 1971,  more than fifty years ago .  Since then, society, \ntechnology, and Fourth Ame ndment jurisprudence have changed markedly.  In the \ncases applying Wyman on which Defendant relies , courts applied Wyman in the \ncontext of upholding termination or denial of a benefit following the beneficiary’s \nrefusal to consent to an inspection, where r efusal triggered no penalties except the \ntermination or denial of benefits.  In this respect, the Sixth Circuit’s decision in \nAndrews, quoting Calabretta from the Ninth Circuit, accurately reads this line of \ncases as applying to a fairly distinct set of ci rcumstances materially different than \nthose at issue here :  making welfare benefits contingent, for all recipients, on a \nlimited and consensual search to confirm expenditure of the funds for the interest of a child.  In contrast , unlike Wyman  and its proge ny, this case involves the privilege \nof college admission and attendance and does not involve a benefit made available to \nall citizens as of right.  Additionally, the record here shows a variable policy —\nenforced , unevenl y, in the discretion of a combination of proctors and professors —of \nusing remote scans that make a student’s home visible , including to other students , \nwith uncertain consequences .   \n Finally, the Court addresses Plaintiff ’s argument that New Jersey v. T.L.O. , \n469 U.S. 325 (1985), provides the proper standard for  the constitutionality of searches \nthat school officials  conduct .  (ECF No. 33\n, PageID #503.)  In  T.L.O. , the Supreme \nCourt  held that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches by school officials , with \nsome accommodation to respond to the needs of the educational environment and \nassess the legality of those searches .  Id.  at 341– 42.  But T.L.O. does not speak to the Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  16 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>17 threshold question of when a school official’s actions constitute a search within the \nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment.   Accordingly, the Court need  not address T.L.O.  \non this question.    \n* * * \n For these reasons, the Court concludes that the Fourth Amendment applies to \nthe virtual room scans Cleveland State uses.  Holding otherwise, as Defenda nt \nargues, raises even more difficult questions about what legal standard, if any, governs \nthe scans and the potential consequences of such a ruling in other areas of life  and \nthe law  that technology touches.  \nII.  Fourth Amendment Reasonableness \n The Fourt h Amendment proscribes only those searches that are unreasonable.  \nHaving held  that the room  scans are searches for purposes of  the Fourth Amendment, \nthe Court turns to whether the scans a re reasonable.   Whether a particular search \nmeets the reasonableness standard “is judged by balancing its intrusion on the \nindividual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate \ngovernmental interests.”  Skinner v. Railway Labor Execs. ’ Ass’n , 489 U.S . 602, 619 \n(1989) (quoting Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648,  654 (1979) ).  Alt hough the Fourth \nAmendment mandates that no warrant may issue except on a showing of probable \ncause, that requirement is not absolute.   A warrant is not required in every case.   \nNational Treasury Emps. Union v. Von Raab , 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989) .  As the text \nof the Fourth Amendment makes clear, the Constitution protects against \nunreasonable  searches and seizures, making reasonableness the ultimate touchstone Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  17 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>20 829–30 (citing Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J , 515 U.S. at 656).  In this context, \nreasonableness under t he Fourth Amendment is informed by the status of students \nas “unemancipated minors” who “have been committed to the temporary custody of \nthe State as schoolm aster.”  Id.  at 654.  In short, under this line of cases, minor \nstudents subject to compulsory school attendance have a lesser privacy interest.  \nIn contrast, Mr. Ogletree was an adult at the time of the search at issue and \nenrolled at Cleveland State by ch oice.  Although this setting might affect the nature \nof the privacy interest at stake to some degree, it is difficult to see how enrollment in \na higher educational institution would limit the core protections of the home under \nthe Fourth Amendment on the f acts and circumstances of this case.   \nII.B.  Character of the Intrusion  \n On the record presented, this analysis encompasses several considerations.  \nFirst, by enrolling in classes at Cleveland State, Mr. Ogletree necessarily traded away \nsome privacy for the privilege and for other goods , such as the opportunity to earn \neducational credentials or to interact with other students or faculty .  Of course, he \nretained his constitutional rights.  See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist ., \n393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969).  In normal times, a student might be able to choose another \ncollege or among classes with different options for tests and assessments.  A student \nwho valued privacy more might opt for courses with in -person tests, while another \nwho prefers conven ience might tolerate an intrusion of the sort at issue here.  \nCleveland State’s policies and practices make such choices and tradeoffs opaque, at \nbest.  Faculty members have discretion on how to implement remote testing.   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  20 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>21 Moreover, b ecause of the pandemic , such choices were not available.  The \nrecord establishes that Mr. Ogletree  did not have the option of attending in -person \nclasses at the time of the room scan.  In other words, enrollment in online courses \nwas Plaintiff’s only option to continue to pursu e his education at Cleveland State.   \nMoreover, in Mr. Ogletree’s case, the professor changed the policy shortly after the start of the course.   As a result, Plaintiff reasonably believed he would not be subject \nto a room scan until approximately two hours before the time of his test.  \nBut the room scan at issue was minimally intrusive.  It is undisputed that the \nscan occurred over an exceedingly short period of time, and Plaintiff had discretion \nover where to direct the camera  in his room , as well as some warning to take steps to \nprotect his priva cy and ensure that the confidential materials he had were not readily \nin view .  On the other hand, other students can see the room scans.  Further, the \n“Fourth Amendment’s protection of the home has never been tied to measurement of \nthe quality or quantity of information obtained.”  Kyllo , 533 U.S. at 35.  Although the \nintrusion at issue might not strike a person  as especially problematic , particularly in \nthe nascent Zoom era, the core protection afforded to the home, the lack of options, \ninconsistency in application of the policy, and short notice of the scan weigh in \nPlaintiff’s favor.  “ It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least \nrepulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional pract ices get their first footing \nin that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of \nprocedure. ”  Silverman , 365 U.S. at 512 (quoting Boyd v. United States , 116 U.S. 616, \n635 (1886) ).   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  21 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>22 II.C.  Government al Interests  \n Defendant ar gues that the room scams facilitate proctoring of tests and ensure \nacademic fairness and integrity.  ( ECF No. 29 , PageID #467.)   These practices help \ndetect other people or unauthorized study aids present in the room  which might  \nimproperly assist the exami nee and deter examinees  from availing themselves of \nthese and other forms of  unauthorized assistance .  (Id., PageID #460; ECF No. 34 , \nPageID #51 8.)  On this point, Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendant has a legitimate \npurpose in preserving the integrity of its test s.  (ECF No. 30 , PageID #490; ECF \nNo. 36, PageID #545 .)  The se considerations weigh in favor of Defendant.  \nII.D.  Efficacy of Means  \n Plaintiff argues that room scans are not necessary to preserve test integrity.  \n(ECF No. 30 , PageID #490.)   Plaintiff points to other procedural safeguards at \nDefendant’s disposal to guard against cheating  and ensure academic integrity .  \nSpecifically, these safeguards include employing proctors to monitor for suspicious \nmovement or  using proctoring programs  that perform functions like preventing \nstudents from accessing the internet or other programs during the test, recording \nstudents during tests , and using artificial intelligence to detect suspicious movement  \nor plagiarism.   (Id., PageID #491– 92.)  \nFurthe r, Plaintiff argues that room scans have  minimal value for preserving \ntest integrity  because there are numerous ways students could cheat that they would \nnot catch .  (Id. , PageID #492.)  For instance, students could access their cell phones \nor notes in another room, since Defendant does not require students to remain on camera for the duration of the test.  (Id., PageID #493 .)  Also, Plaintiff notes  that Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  22 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>23 Defendant does not require a room s can; rather, the decision is left to individual \nfaculty in their discretion —a policy that acknowledges that such means are not \nstrictly necessary , but one available option among many .  (Id. , PageID #490– 91.)   \nDefendant counters that Plaintiff’s proposed a lternatives would not fulfill the \ndetecti on and deterrent functions that room scans  do.  (ECF No. 34 , PageID #519.)   \nRegarding proctoring programs, Defendant argues that they are not  effective at \nachieving these purposes and that sometime s they are inappro priate for students \nwith disabilities.  ( Id.; see ECF No. 34 -1, PageID #523– 24.) \nThough reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment does not require \nemployin g the least intrusive means,  Earls, 536 U.S. at 837, the efficacy of the means \nDefendant has chosen to advance its purpose is a factor in determining \nreasonable ness.  Without question, other procedural safeguards would advance the \nsame purpose s—indeed, Cleveland State employs some of them.  Also, pedagogica l \nalternatives  to tests for assessing students , for instance, a final project or paper , \nmight minimize or eliminate the need for remote scans .  Plaintiff points to several \nways in which students may cheat regardless of the use of room scans .  Besides \npoint ing to the potential deterrent effect, Defendant does not offer much argument or \nevidence to support the efficacy of room scans.   Perhaps experience with room scans \nis too recent or not extensive enough to offer much in this regard.  Whatever the case, a record of s poradic and discretionary use of room scans does not permit a finding \nthat rooms scans are truly, and uniquely, effective at preserving test integrity.   \nAccordingly, this factor weighs in Plaintiff’s favor  too. Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  23 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>24 * * * \n Based on consideration of these factors, individually and collectively, the Court \nconcludes that Mr. Ogletree’s privacy interest in his home outweighs Cleveland \nState’s interests in scanning his room.  Accordingly, the Court determines that \nCleveland State’s practice of conducting room scans is unreasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES  Defendant’s motion for \nsummary judgment and GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion.  The Court DIRECTS  counsel \nto confer on the appropriate next steps , including on the propriety of entering a \ndeclaratory judgment or injunction  and the proper scope for either,  and to submit a \nshort joint status report no later than September 12, 2022.  \n SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   August 22, 2022 \n  \nJ.

    "summary": "1. Summary: This court case involves Nathaniel Covington, who is charged with sexual exploitation of a child, enticement, and transporting a minor for criminal sexual activity. The allegations claim that Covington used the internet to persuade a minor for sexual conduct and transported the minor across state lines. The opinion involves instructions to the jury regarding their duties, rules for considering evidence, and maintaining fairness by not using external sources like AI for decision-making.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: The key legal issue is whether Nathaniel Covington is guilty of sexual exploitation of a child, enticement, and transporting a minor across state lines for criminal sexual activity, as per the charges brought by the United States.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The document does not contain the court’s final holding as it comprises preliminary jury instructions meant to guide the jury on legal standards and considerations applicable during the trial process.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you're a referee at a big game. Before the game starts, you need to explain the rules to the players. This court document is like that explanation, directed at the jury in a trial. The judge is telling the jury their job is to listen to what everyone in the trial has to say and not to form any opinions until they've heard it all. They can't use the internet or chat with people about what they're hearing because it might impact their decision about whether the person accused did something wrong or not.",
    "full_text": "1 \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nWESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY  \nLOUISVILLE DIVISION  \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  Plaintiff,  \n  \nv. Criminal Action No. 3:23 -cr-24-DJH-1 \n  \nNATHANIEL COVINGTON,  Defendant.  \n \n*  *  *  *  * \n \nPRELIMINARY JURY INSTRUCTIONS  \n \n Members of the jury: Now that you have been sworn, I will give you some preliminary \ninstructions to guide you in your participation in the trial.  \nI. DUTY OF THE JURY  \n It will be your duty to find from the evidence what the facts are.  You and you alone wil l \nbe the judges of the facts.  You will then have to apply to those facts the law as the Court will give \nit to you.  You must follow that law whether you agree with it or not.  \n Nothing th at I may say or do during the course of the trial is intended to indi cate, or should \nbe taken by you as indicating, what your verdict should be.  \nII. EVIDENCE  \n The evidence from which you will find the facts will consist of the testimony of witnesses; \ndocuments and other things received into the record as exhibits; and any f acts that the lawyers \nagree to or stipulate to or that I may instruct you to find.  \n Certain things are not evidence and must not be considered by you.  I will list them for you \nnow.  \n (1) Statements, arguments, and questions by lawyers are not evidence.  Case 3:23-cr-00024-DJH     Document 95     Filed 08/11/25     Page 1 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n  (2) Objections to questions are not evidence.  Lawyers have an obligation to their \nclients to make objections when they believe evidence being offered is improper under the rules \nof evidence.  You should not be influenced by the objection or by my ruling on it.  If the objection \nis sustained, ignore the question.  If it is overruled, treat the answer like any other.  If you are \ninstructed that some item of evidence is received for a limited purpose only, you must follow that \ninstruction.  \n (3) Testimony that I have excluded or told you to disregard is not evidence and must \nnot be considered.  \n (4) Anything you may have seen or heard outside the courtroom is not evidence and \nmust be disregarded.  You are to decide the case solely on the evidence presented here in the \ncourtroom.  \n There are two kinds of evidence: direct and circumstantial.  Direct evidence is direct proof \nof a fact, such as testimony of an eyewitness.  Circumstantial evidence is proof of facts from which \nyou may infer or conclude th at other facts exist.  I will give you further instructions on these as \nwell as other matters at the end of the case, but keep in mind that you may consider both kinds of \nevidence.  \n It will be up to you to decide which witnesses to believe, which witnesses  not to believe, \nand how much of any witness’s testimony to accept or reject.  I will give you some guidelines for \ndetermining the credibility of witnesses at the end of the case.  \nIII. RULES FOR CRIMINAL CASES  \n As you know, this is a criminal case.  There are three basic rules about criminal cases that \nyou must keep in mind.  Case 3:23-cr-00024-DJH     Document 95     Filed 08/11/25     Page 2 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n  First, the defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.  The indictment brought by \nthe government against the defendant is only an accusation, nothing more.  It is not pro of of guilt \nor anything else. The defendant therefore start s out with a clean slate.  \n Second, the burden of proof is on the government until the very end of the case.  The \ndefendant  has no burden to prove its innocence, or to present any evidence, or to te stify.  Since the \ndefendant ha s the right to remain silent, the law prohibits you from arriving at your verdict by \nconsidering that the defendant may not have testified.  \n Third, the government must prove the defendant ’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  I will \ngive you further instructions on this point later, but bear in mind that in this respect a criminal case \nis different from a civil case.  \nIV. SUMMARY OF THE CASE  \n In this case, Defendant Nathaniel Covington is charged with one count of sexual \nexploitat ion of a child , one count of enticement, and one count of transporting a minor with intent \nthat the minor engage in criminal sexual activity .  The United States alleges that in June 2022, \nCovington used  the internet  to persuade a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct .  The \ngovernment further alleges that Covington transported the minor from Tennessee to Kentucky to \nengage in sexual activity.   Covington denies these allegations and has pleaded not guilty to all  of \nthe charges.  \n I will give you detailed instructions on the law at the end of the case, and those instructions \nwill control your deliberations and decision.  But in order to help you follow the evidence, I will \nnow give you a brief summary of the elemen ts of the offenses that the government must prove to \nmake its case.  Case 3:23-cr-00024-DJH     Document 95     Filed 08/11/25     Page 3 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n For you to find Defendant Nathaniel Covington guilty of  sexual exploitation of \nchildren , the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt  \n(1) that the defendant used a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the \npurpose of producing a visual depiction of that conduct;  and  \n(2) that the visual depiction was produced or transmitted using materials that were \nmailed, shipped, or transported in or affecting interstate commerc e by any means, including \ncomputer.  \nFor you to find Defendant  Nathaniel Covington guilty of enticement , the government \nmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt  \n(1) that the defendant knowingly persuaded, induced, enticed, and coerced an \nindividual under the age of 18 to engage in unlawful sexual activity ; \n(2) that the defendant used a means or facility of interstate commerce to do so; and  \n(3) that the defendant knew the individual was under the age of 18.  \nFor you to find Defendant Nathaniel Covington  guilty of transporting a minor with \nintent that the minor engage in criminal sexual activity , the government must prove beyond \na reasonable doubt  \n(1) that the defendant knowingly transported an individual;  \n(2) that the individual transported was under 18 years of age;  \n(3) that defendant intended the individual to engage in criminal sexual activity; and  \n(4)  that the transportation was in interstate commerce.  \nV. CONDUCT OF THE JURY  \n Now, a few words about your conduct as jurors.  Case 3:23-cr-00024-DJH     Document 95     Filed 08/11/25     Page 4 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n  You, as jurors, m ust decide this case based solely on the evidence presented here within \nthe four walls of this courtroom.  This means that during the trial you must not conduct any \nindependent research about this case, the matters in the case, and the individuals or corpo rations \ninvolved in the case.  In other words, you should not consult dictionaries or reference materials, \nsearch the Internet, websites, or apps, or use artificial intelligence or any other electronic tools to \nobtain information about this case or to help  you decide the case.  Please do not try to find out \ninformation from any source outside the confines of this courtroom.  \n Until you retire to deliberate, you may not discuss this case with anyone, even your fellow \njurors.  After you retire to deliberate, you may begin discussing the case with your fellow jurors, \nbut you cannot discuss the case with anyone else until you have returned a verdict and the case is \nat an end.  \n I know that most of you use smart  phones, the Internet, and other tools of technology.  You \nalso must not talk to anyone at any time about this case or use these tools to communicate \nelectronically with anyone  about the case.  This includes your family and friends.  You may not \ncommunicate with anyone about the cas e on your smart  phone, through e mail, text messaging, or \non Twitter  (now called X ), or through any app, blog or website, including Facebook, LinkedIn , \nInstagram, Snapc hat, TikTok or YouTube.  You may not use any similar technology of social \nmedia, even if I have not specifically mentioned it here.  I expect you will inform me immediately \nif you become aware of another juror’s violation of these instruc tions.  A juror who violates  these \nrestrictions jeopardizes the fairness of these proceedings, and a mistrial could result, which would \nrequire the entire trial process to start over.  \n Finally, do not form any opinion until all the evidence is in.  Keep an  open mind until you \nstart your deliberations at the end of the case.  Case 3:23-cr-00024-DJH     Document 95     Filed 08/11/25     Page 5 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n  I hope that for all of you this case is interesting and noteworthy.  \n If you want to take notes during the course of the trial, you may do so.  However, it is \ndifficult to take detailed notes and pay attention to what the witnesses are saying at the same time.  \nIf you do take notes, be sure that your note -taking does not interfere with your listening to and \nconsidering all of the evidence.  Also, if you do take notes, do not discuss them with anyone before \nyou begin your deliberations.  Do not take your notes with you at the end of the day —be sure to \nleave them in the jury room.  \n If you choose not to take notes, remember that it is your own individual responsibility to \nlisten carefully to the evidence.  You cannot give this responsibility to someone who is taking \nnotes.  We depend on the judgment of all members of the jury; you all must remember the evidence \nin this case.  \nVI. COURSE OF THE TRIAL  \n The trial will now begin.  First, the government will make an opening statement, which is \nsimply an outline to help you understand the evidence as it comes in.  Next, the defendant ’s \nattorney may, but does not have to, make an opening statement.  Opening s tatements are neither \nevidence nor arguments.  \n The government will then present its witnesses, and counsel for the defendant  may cross -\nexamine them.  Following the government’s case,  the defendant may, if  he wishes, present \nwitnesses whom the government ma y cross -examine.  After all the evidence is in, the attorneys \nwill present their closing arguments to summarize and interpret the evidence for you, and I will \ninstruct you on the law.  After that, you will retire to deliberate on your verdict.  Case 3:23-cr-00024-DJH     Document 95     Filed 08/11/25     Page 6 of 6 PageID #:\n<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves Derek Hall appealing a summary judgment decision in favor of UiPath, Inc., which he accused of retaliation under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) after his termination. The district court found Hall had not shown a causal connection between his protected activity (filing an age discrimination complaint) and his termination and failed to counter UiPath's legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for adverse actions. While UiPath is a company that deals with automation and AI software, the court case does not directly hinge on AI involvement.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Derek Hall presented sufficient evidence of a causal link between his age discrimination complaint and his later termination, to refute the non-discriminatory reasons offered by UiPath for his termination.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court affirmed the lower court's summary judgment in favor of UiPath, stating that Hall did not challenge the district court's conclusion regarding UiPath's legitimate rationale for termination and failed to demonstrate that those reasons were pretextual.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Derek Hall was fired and thought it was because he complained about being treated badly due to his age. But when he tried to prove this in court, he couldn't show that his complaint was the reason he was fired. The other side, UiPath, said they had good reasons unrelated to age for letting him go, and Hall didn’t argue against this effectively. As a result, the court decided they didn't need to have a full trial and ruled in favor of UiPath.",

Hall joined UiPath in November 2018 as \na Senior Account Executive. Hall was sixty -two years old at that time. Over \nthe next nine months, Hall’s then -supervisor, Carmel Smith, observed or \nwas made aware of numerous purported deficiencies in Hall’s performance. \nOn August 29, 2019, Smith placed Hall on a thirty -day Performance \nImprovement Plan (PIP). On the same day, Hall submitted an internal complaint against Smith complaining of age discrimination. UiPath and Hall entered into a Separation and Release of Claims agreement in October 2019, terminating Hall effective November 12, 2019 , and releasing UiPath from any \nand all claims, including his prior claim of age discrimination.  \nHall began employment with Accelirate, Inc. , as Vice President of \nSales  around  November 28, 2019. Accelirate is an information technology \nservice management company, and UiPath partners with Accelirate to sell and implement its software products to end user companies. Hall acknowledges that he never  informed Accelirate that he was involuntarily \nterminated from UiPath for poor performance and behavior. On December \n2, 2019, Smith —who was monitoring Hall’s old UiPath e -mail inbox —saw \nan e -mail from Hall’s cowo rker at Accelirate, Nikky Shaffer, that had been \naccidentally sent to Hall’s UiPath email. Smith then learned from  Shaffer \nthat Hall now worked for Accelirate.  On December 17, Smith texted Shaffer  \nthat she was “ getting a lot of complaints on [Hall] ” and that she preferred \nthat Hall “ not cover [] my territory[ .]” Shaffer informed Smith that Hall \nreported to Accelirate executive, Matt Gallo, and Smith agreed to discuss the Case: 23-50651      Document: 78-1     Page: 2     Date Filed: 12/12/2024 \n3 \n issue with Gallo in early January, adding: “In the meantime, we don’t need \nthe hassle please.”  \nThat same day —approximately two weeks after Smith discovered \nHall’s new position with Accelirate —Gallo terminated Hall. The parties \ndispute whether Hall’s termination was Gallo’s independent decision or if he \nrelied upon information provided by UiPath , but agree that the termination \ndecision was communicated to Hall by phone, and that there is no written record of the meeting. Hall alleges that on the call Gallo informed him that he received certain “text or email messages from UiPath,” and that “it was not going to work .” Gallo states he  decided  to terminate Hall for \n“Accelirate’s own unique business reasons,” including Hall’s lack of “relationship advantage” with anyone at UiPath  and Hall “not mesh[ing] \nwell, personality - or communication -wise with the Sales team.” Hall was \nterminated effective immediately.   \nOn August 19, 2021, Hall sued UiPath, bringing claims for retaliation \nunder the ADEA and tortious interference with contractual relationships. UiPath filed a motion for summary judgment on both claims. The district \ncourt found that although Hall had presen ted sufficient evidence to establish \na statutorily protected activity and an adverse employment action, he had \nfailed to establish a causal link between the two  and failed to rebut UiPath’s \nnon- discriminatory rationale for Smith’s messages . The district co urt also \ngranted summary judgment on the tortious interference claim on the grounds \nthat the claim had been waived.  Hall appeals the entry of summary judgment \nas to his retaliation claim  only .  \nII. \nA grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo . Nickell v. Beau View \nof Biloxi, L .L.C., 636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir. 2011).  Summary judgment is \nproper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any Case: 23-50651      Document: 78-1     Page: 3     Date Filed: 12/12/2024 \n4 \n material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “[W]here the non -movant bears the burden of \nproof at trial, the movant may merely point to an absence of evidence,” which “shift[s] to the non -movant the burden of demonstrating by competent \nsummary judgment proof that there is an issue of material fact warranting trial.”  Lindsey v. Sears Roebuck & Co., 16 F.3d 616, 618 (5th Cir. 1994)  (per \ncuriam) .  “The nonmovant cannot satisfy this burden merely by denying the \nallegations in the opponent ’s pleadings but can do so by tendering \ndepositions, affidavits, and other competent evidence to buttress its claim.”  Donaghey v. Ocean Drilling & Expl. Co. , 974 F.2d 646, 649 (5th Cir. 1992).  \n“When assessing whether a dispute to any material fact exists, [courts] consider all of the evidence in the record but refrain from making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.”  Turner v. Baylor Richardson M ed. \nCtr., 476 F.3d 337, 343 (5th Cir. 2007).  \nIII. \nOn appeal, Hall argues that his retaliation claim under the ADEA \nraises disputes of material fact inappropriate for resolution at summary \njudgment.  The ADEA prohibits employers from firing, refusing to hire, or \notherwise discriminating against any individual with respect to their \ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of \ntheir age. 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). This circuit gen erally assesses ADEA age-\ndiscrimination claims relying on circumstantial evidence under the burden -\nshifting analysis set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green , 411 U.S. 792 \n(1973). See Jackson v. Cal -W. Packaging Corp. , 602 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir. \n2010). To establish a prima facie claim of retaliation under the ADEA, Hall must show (1) that he engaged in a protected activity, (2) that he experienced an adverse employment action, and (3) “that a causal link existed betwe en \nthe protected activity and the adverse employment action.” Wooten v. Case: 23-50651      Document: 78-1     Page: 4     Date Filed: 12/12/2024 \n5 \n McDonald Transit Assocs., Inc. , 788 F.3d 490, 496 –97 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting \nHoltzclaw v. DSC Commc’ns Corp. , 255 F.3d 254, 259 (5th Cir. 2001)).  \nIf Hall succeeds in making this prima facie showing, the burden shifts \nto UiPath to articulate a legitimate, non -discriminatory reason for the adverse \nemployment action. See Allen v. United States Postal Serv., 63 F.4th 292, 301 \n(5th Cir. 2023).  If UiPath does so, the burden shifts back to Hall to show that \nthe articulated reason is pretextual. See i d.  Hall may show pretext by showing \nthat UiPath’s proffered non -discriminatory explanation is false or \n“unworthy of credence.” Moss v. BMC Software, Inc. , 610  F.3d 917, 922 (5th \nCir. 2010)  (quoting Jackson , 602 F.3d at 379). The district court held both \nthat Hall did not show  a causal link and that Hall failed to rebut UiPath’s non -\ndiscriminatory explanation. In particular, the  district court held that because \nHall denied harassing conduct “but does not refute that he was contacting \n[UiPath employees] for potential sales leads . . . . Hall has failed to present \nevidence that . . . the explanation proffered by UiPath was pretext for \nunlawful retaliation.”  \nOn appeal, Hall did not mention this second  element of the district \ncourt’s analysis in his opening brief , did not discuss UiPath’s proffered non -\ndiscriminatory explanation in his appellant brief at all, and  did not offer \nevidence to show that UiPath’s stated motivations were pretextual. Although Hall did state that “[t]here is a fact issue over whether or not Ms. Smith’s comments were false,” he did not tie this statement to the law or to the district court’s ruling .  \nIn general, “[a] party who inadequately briefs an issue is considered \nto have abandoned the claim.” Cinel v. Connick , 15 F.3d 1338, 1345 (5th Cir. \n1994); see also Rollins v. Home Depot USA , 8 F.4th 393, 397 (5th Cir. 2021). \n“To be adequate, a brief must ‘ address the district court’s analysis and \nexplain how it erred. ’” SEC v. Hallam , 42 F.4th 316, 327 (5th Cir. 2022)  Case: 23-50651      Document: 78-1     Page: 5     Date Filed: 12/12/2024 \n6 \n (quoting Rollins , 8 F.4th at 397 n.1); see Guillot ex rel.  T.A.G. v. Russell , 59 \nF.4th 743 , 751  (5th Cir. 2023) (the appealing party should “attempt to rebut \n[the] judgment”). Where a party’s “opening brief barely ‘ address[ed] the \ndistrict court’s analysis ’ and wholly neglected to ‘ explain how it erred, ’” \nSmith v. Sch. Bd. of Concordia Par., 88 F.4th 588, 594 (5th Cir. 2023)  \n(alteration in original)  (quoting T.A.G., 59 F.4th at 751 ), that argument is \nforfeited. After  UiPath argue d that Hall waived any argument about its \nproffered non -discriminatory rationale for the negative reference , Hall failed \nto file a reply . At oral argument, his counsel suggested that the opening brief \nsufficiently addressed the alternative basis for summary judgment.  \nWe can find no indication  of Hall challenging the district court’s \ndetermination or analysis in the record.  Because Hall has forfeited any \nchallenge to UiPath’s proffered rationale , which is an independent basis for \nsummary judgment on his retaliation claim, we need not reach Hall’s \nchallenge to causation. We AFFIRM  the district court’s grant of summary \njudgment  to UiPath .  Case: 23-50651      Document: 78-1     Page: 6     Date Filed: 12/12/2024",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Kemp v. Beirami, plaintiff Bobby M. Kemp filed a civil rights lawsuit against Ahmad Beirami, alleging that Beirami, while employed at Meta Platforms, Inc., was involved in the creation of an AI system that illegally intercepted Kemp's electronic communications and facial recognition profile. The court denied Kemp's motion to proceed in forma pauperis because he failed to provide the necessary prison trust fund account statement and dismissed the case without prejudice due to the improper filing fee or insufficient support for his IFP application.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff, Bobby M. Kemp, could proceed with his lawsuit without paying the standard filing fee by adequately demonstrating financial incapacity as a prisoner and if he properly established venue in the Southern District of California.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Kemp's motion to proceed in forma pauperis due to failure to submit the required trust fund account statement and dismissed the action without prejudice for not paying the requisite filing fees or providing a properly supported motion to proceed IFP. Additionally, venue was not properly established.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you want to sue someone but don't have enough money to pay the filing fee upfront. There's a rule that if you really can't afford it, you can apply to waive the fee by showing proof of your financial situation. In this case, the person suing didn't give enough information to show he couldn't pay, so the court said, \"You can't move forward with your lawsuit until you either pay the fee or give us the right paperwork.\" Plus, the court said it might not be the right location for the lawsuit, as the person he was suing was in a different place.",

Motion to Proceed  IFP \n All parties instituting any civil action  in a district court of the United States, except \na petition  for writ of habeas corpus, must pay a civil filing fee of $402, and t he action may \nproceed despite a failure to prepay the entire fee o nly if leave to proceed IFP  is granted \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a).2  See 28 U.S.C. § 1914(a) ; Andrews v. Cervantes, 493 \nF.3d 1047, 1051 (9th Cir.  2007) (“28 U.S.C.  § 1915(a)  allows the district court to waive \nthe fee, for most individuals unable to afford it, by granting IFP status.”)   \nPlaintiffs who wish to proceed IFP must establish their inability to pay the civil filing \nfee by filing an affidavit attesting to their incom e and assets, s ee Escobedo v. Applebees , \n787 F.3d 1226, 1234 (9th Cir. 2015) , which Plaintiff has provided.  ( See ECF No. 2 at 1-\n5.)  However, prisoners seeking leave to proceed IFP are also required to submit a “certified \ncopy of the trust fund account st atement (or institutional equivalent) for . . . the 6 -month \nperiod immediately preceding the filing of the complaint.”  28 U.S.C. §  1915(a)(2); \nAndrews v. King , 398 F.3d 1113, 1119 (9th Cir. 2005) .  From the certified trust account \nstatement, the Court assesses an initial payment of 20% of (a) the average monthly deposits \nin the account for the past six months, or (b) the average monthly balance in the account \nfor the past six months, whichever is greater, unless the prisoner has no assets.   See 28 \nU.S.C. §  1915(b)(1)  & (4).  The institution collects subsequent payments, assessed at 20% \nof the preceding month’s income, in any month in which the  account exceeds $10, and \nforwards those payments to the Court until the entire filing fee is paid.  See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915(b)(2).   Once IFP is granted, Plaintiff remains  obligated to pay the entire fee in \nmonthly  installments regardless of whether the  action is ultimately dismissed.  Bruce v. \nSamuels,  577 U.S. 82, 84 (2016).   \n \n2  In addition to a $350 fee, civil litigants , other than those  granted leave to proceed IFP , \nmust pay an additional administrative fee of $5 2.  See 28 U.S.C. §  1914(a) (Judicial \nConference Schedule of Fees, District Court Misc. Fee Schedule, § 14 (eff. Dec.  1, 2020) ). \n Case 3:23-cv-00832-GPC-AHG   Document 3   Filed 05/19/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 2 of 5 \n3 \n23cv0832 -GPC (AHG)  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  Plaintiff’s IFP application does not contain the required trust fund account statement.  \n(See ECF No. 2.)  T he Court cannot grant his IFP application without the trust fund account \nstatement for the 6-month period immediately preceding the filing of his Complaint .  See \nAndrews , 398 F.3d at 1119 (“ [P]risoners must demonstrate that they are not able to pay the \nfiling fee with an affidavit and submission of their prison trust account records.”), citing \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(1)&(2).  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED  \nand this action is DISMISSE D without prejudice based on Plaintiff’s failure to pay the  \ncivil filing and a dministrative fee or to submit a properly supported m otion  to proceed IFP \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1914(a) & 1915(a).  \nII. Venue  \nIn addition, t he C ourt notes that the Southern District of California may not be the \nproper venue for Plaintiff’s case .  Venue may be raised by the Court sua sponte where the \ndefendant has not yet filed a responsive pleading and the time for doing so has not run.  See \nCostlow v. Weeks , 790 F.2d 1486, 1488 (9th Cir. 1986).   \n“A civil action may be brought in (1) a judicial district in which any defendant \nresides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; [or] (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaim occurred, o r a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is \nsituated . . . .”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b); Costlow , 790 F.2d at 1488; Decker Coal Co. v. \nCommonwealth Edison Co. , 805 F.2d 834, 842 (9th Cir. 1986).  “The district court of a \ndistrict in wh ich is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, \nor if it be in the interests of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.”  28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).      \nPlaintiff  names as the sole Defendant  Ahmad Beirami,  and indicates this  Defendant \nis a citizen of California and works for Meta Platforms, Inc., a company incorporated in California.  (ECF No. 1 at 1.)  None of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s \nclaims are alle ged to have occurred in either San Diego or Imperial County, and no \nDefendant is alleged to reside here.  See 28 U.S.C. § 84(d) (“The Southern District of Case 3:23-cv-00832-GPC-AHG   Document 3   Filed 05/19/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 3 of 5 \n4 \n23cv0832 -GPC (AHG)  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 California comprises the counties of Imperial and San Diego.”)  Therefore, Plaintiff has \nnot adequate ly plead that venue is proper in the Southern  District of California.  See 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391(b); Costlow , 790 F.2d at 1488.   \nIII. Conclusion and Order  \n Accordingly, the Court:  \n (1) DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion to proceed IFP without prejudice.  \n (2) DISMISSES  this civil action without prejudice based on Plaintiff’s failure to \npay the civil filing and a dministrative fee or to submit a properly supported motion  to \nproceed IFP pursuant to 28 U.S. C. §§ 1914(a) & 1915(a).  \n (3) GRANTS  Plaintiff  forty -five (45)  days leave from the date this Order is filed \nto: (a) prepay the entire $40 2 civil filing and administrative fee in full; or (b) complete and \nfile a properly supported m otion to proceed IFP whic h includes a certified copy of his  \nprison trust account statement for the 6-month period preceding the filing of his Complaint . \nSee 28 U.S.C. §  1915(a)(2); S.D. Cal. CivLR 3.2(b).   If Plaintiff fails to either pay the $40 2 \ncivil filing fee or submit a prop erly supported m otion to proceed IFP within 45 days, this \naction will remain dismissed without prejudice based solely on hi s failure  to satisfy 28 \nU.S.C. §  1914(a)’s fee requiremen t and without further Order of the Court.  \nThe Court expresses no opinion a t this time a s to whether Plaintiff’s pleading should \nsurvive the sua sponte  screening required by 28 U.S.C. §  1915A.  See Byrd v. Phoenix \nPolice Dep’t , 885 F.3d 639, 641 (9th Cir. 2018) (“For certain prisoner civil rights litigation, \n28 U.S.C. §  1915A(a) requires pre -answer screening of the complaint so that ‘the targets \nof frivolous or malicious suits need not bear the expense of responding.’”  (quoting \nNordstrom v. Ryan , 762 F.3d 903, 907 n.1 (9th Cir. 2014) )).  In any case , if Plaintiff wishes \nto proceed with this action in this Court, he will be required to adequately plead that venue \nlies in the Southern District of California .  \n\\\\\\ \n\\\\\\ \n\\\\\\ Case 3:23-cv-00832-GPC-AHG   Document 3   Filed 05/19/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 4 of 5 \n5 \n23cv0832 -GPC (AHG)  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 IT IS SO ORDERED  \nDated:  May 19, 2023   \n \n \nCase 3:23-cv-00832-GPC-AHG   Document 3   Filed 05/19/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 5 of 5",

From the certified trust account \nstatement, the Court ass esses an initial payment of 20% of (a) the average monthly deposits \nin the account for the past six months, or (b) the average monthly balance in the account \nfor the past six months, whichever is greater, unless the prisoner has no assets.   See 28 \nU.S.C. §  1915(b)(1)  & (4).  The institution collects subsequent payments, assessed at 20% \nof the preceding month’s income, in any month in which the account exceeds $10, and \nforwards those payments to the Court until the entire filing fee is paid.  See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915(b)(2).   Once IFP is granted, Plaintiff remains  obligated to pay the entire fee in \nmonthly  installments regardless of whether the action is ultimately dismissed.  Bruce v. \nSamuels , 577 U.S. 82, 84 (2016).   \n Plaintiff’s IFP application does not contain  the required trust fund account statement.  \n(See ECF No. 2.)  T he Court cannot grant his IFP application without the trust fund account \nstatement for the 6 -month period immediately preceding the filing of his Complaint .  See \n \n1  In addition to a $350 fee, civil litigants , other than those  granted leave to proceed IFP , \nmust pay an additional administrative fee of $5 2.  See 28 U.S.C. §  1914(a) (Judicial \nConference Schedule of Fees, District Court Misc. Fee Schedule, § 14 (eff. Dec. 1, 20 20)). \n Case 3:23-cv-01198-DMS-AHG   Document 3   Filed 07/17/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 2 of 4 \n3 \n23cv1198 DMS AHG  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Andrews , 398 F.3d at 1119 (“prisoners must demonstrate that they are not able to pay the \nfiling fee with an affidavit and submission of their prison trust account records.”), citing \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(1)&(2).  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED  \nand this action is DISMISSE D without prejudice based on Plaintiff’s  failure to pay the \ncivil filing and a dministrative fee or to submit a properly supported m otion  to proceed IFP \npursuant to 2 8 U.S.C. §§ 1914(a) & 1915(a).  \nII. Venue  \nIn addition, t he C ourt notes  that the Southern District of California may not be the \nproper venue for Plaintiff’s case .  Venue may be raised by the Court  sua sponte where the \ndefendant has not yet filed a responsive pleading and the time for doing so has not run.  See \nCostlow v. Weeks , 790 F.2d 1486, 1488 (9th Cir. 1986).   \n“A civil action may be brought in – (1) a judicial district in which any defendant \nresides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; [or] (2) a \njudicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the \nclaim occurred, o r a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is \nsituated  . . . .”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b); Costlow , 790 F.2d at 1488; Decker Coal Co. v. \nCommonwealth Edison Co. , 805 F.2d 834, 842 (9th Cir. 1986).  “The district court of a \ndistrict in wh ich is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, \nor if it be in the interests of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it \ncould have been brought.”  28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).      \nPlaintiff  names as the sole Defendant  Heinrich Kuttler , and indicates th is Defendant \nis a citizen of California and works for Meta Platforms, Inc., a company incorporated in \nCalifornia.  (ECF No. 1 at 1.)  None of the events or omissions giving rise to Plaintiff’s \nclaims are a lleged to have occurred in either San Diego or Imperial County, and no \nDefendant is alleged to reside here.  See 28 U.S.C. § 84(d) (“The Southern District of \nCalifornia comprises the counties of Imperial and San Diego.”)  Therefore, Plaintiff has \nnot adequ ately plead that  venue is proper in the Southern  District of Californi a.  See 28 \nU.S.C. § 1391(b); Costlow , 790 F.2d at 1488.   Case 3:23-cv-01198-DMS-AHG   Document 3   Filed 07/17/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 3 of 4 \n4 \n23cv1198 DMS AHG  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 III. Conclusion and Order  \n Accordingly, the Court:  \n (1) DENIES  Plaintiff’s motion to proceed IFP without prejudice.  \n (2) DISMISSES  this civil action without prejudice based on Plaintiff’s  failure to \npay the civil filing and a dministrative fee or to submit a properly supported motion  to \nproceed IFP pursuant to 2 8 U.S. C. §§ 1914(a) & 1915(a).  \n (3) GRANTS  Plaintiff  forty -five (45)  days leave from the date this Order is filed \nto: (a) prepay the entire $40 2 civil filing and administrative fee in full; or (b) complete and \nfile a properly supported m otion to proceed IFP whic h includes a certified copy of his  \nprison trust account statement for the 6 -month period preceding the filing of his Complaint . \nSee 28 U.S.C. §  1915(a)(2); S.D. Cal. CivLR 3.2(b).   If Plaintiff fails to either pay the $40 5 \ncivil filing fee or submit a prop erly supported m otion to proceed IFP within 45 days, this \naction will remain dismis sed without prejudice based solely on hi s failure  to satisfy 28 \nU.S.C. §  1914(a)’s fee requiremen t and without further Order of the Court.  \nThe Court expresses no opinion a t this time a s to whether Plaintiff’s pleading should \nsurvive the sua sponte  screening required by 28 U.S.C. § 1915A.  See Byrd v. Phoenix \nPolice Dep’t , 885 F.3d 639, 641 (9th Cir. 2018) (“For certain prisoner civil rights litigation, \n28 U.S.C. §  1915A(a) requires pre -answer screening of the complaint so that ‘the targets \nof frivolous or malicious suits need not bear the expense of responding.’” ), quoting \nNordstrom v. Ryan , 762 F.3d 903, 907 n.1 (9th Cir. 2014) .  In any case , if Plaintiff wishes \nto proceed with this action in this Court, he will be required to adequately plead that venue \nlies in the Southern District of California .  \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \nDated:  July 17, 2023  \n \nCase 3:23-cv-01198-DMS-AHG   Document 3   Filed 07/17/23   PageID.<pageID>   Page 4 of 4",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves plaintiffs Sayeh Sharifymoghaddam and Seyyed Mahmood Jafari Sadeghi, both distinguished AI researchers, seeking to compel the U.S. government to promptly decide on their immigrant visa applications. They argue that the delay is unreasonable under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Mandamus Act. The court dismissed the case, finding the 15-month delay in processing their visas is not unreasonable as a matter of law.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the delay in adjudicating the plaintiffs' visa applications is unreasonable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and warrants a court order to compel action.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that the delay in processing the plaintiffs' visa applications, though unfortunate, is not unreasonable according to legal standards, particularly when considering the agency's need to manage multiple applicants and prioritize resources.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you ordered a pizza, and it's taking longer than expected to arrive. You call the pizza place, but they have many orders and are working as fast as they can. In this case, two very smart tech experts want to move to the U.S. for work but are stuck waiting for their visas. They asked a judge to make the U.S. officials decide faster. However, just like the pizza place, the officials have many similar requests and need time to handle each one. The judge decided that the wait, while annoying, isn't long enough to make the officials rush and put these two ahead of others waiting for their \"pizza.\"",

They bring suit under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 555(b), 706(1), and the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, to compel a final decision on their \nimmigrant visa applications. They contend that the U.S. Secretary of State, the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services, and the Consul General of the U.S. Consulate in Montr eal, \nCanada (collectively, “ defendants”) , have unreasonably delayed rendering a decision on whether \nthey can immigrate to the United States . Defendants have moved to dismiss the case for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted . Upon \nconsideration of the parties’ briefing, the record, and the applicable law, the Court will GRANT defendants’ motion and dismiss plaintiffs’ Complaint for failure to state a claim.  \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Factual History \nThe Court draws  the following factual allegations from plaintiffs’ Complaint , which the \nCourt must accept as true when  evaluating  defendants’ motion to dismiss. Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).

Both work for startups that  would like them to relocate from \nCanada to the United States. Compl. ¶ 10. Consequently, on May 24, 2019, Dr. Sharifymoghaddam \nfiled an I -140 National Interest Wai ver EB-2 immigration petition. Compl.  ¶ 44. EB-2 visa s permit \nnoncitizen s with “extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics which \nhas been demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim  and whose achievements \nhave been recognized in the field through extensive documentation . . . to ente r the United States \nto continue work in the area of extraordinary ability.” 8 U.S.C. § 1153( b)(1)(A). As \nDr. Sharifymoghaddam’s spouse, Dr. Sadeghi is a derivative beneficiary of her immigration \npetition . Compl.  ¶ 45; see 8 U.S.C. § 1153( d) (“A spouse or c hild . . . shall  . . . be entitled to the \nsame status  . . . if accompanying or following to join, the [ petitioning ] spouse or parent.”).  United \nStates Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Dr.  Sharifymoghaddam’s petition on \nApril  9, 2020. Compl. ¶ ¶ 3, 44.  \nAfter approving, USCIS forwarded the matter to the U.S. Department of State for further \nprocessing. Compl. ¶ 46. Plaintiffs  timely filed their DS -260 visa applications with the National \nVisa Center on July 13 and 14, 2020. Compl. ¶ 46. On November 23, 2022, Plaintiffs interviewed \nwith the U.S. Consulate in Montreal. Compl. ¶ 47. Following the interview, Plaintiffs were \ninformed that their applications w ere “refused for administrative processing ” and required \nsupplemental paperwork. Compl. ¶¶ 48, 52; 221(g) Notice , ECF No.  1-2.1 Plaintiffs were \n \n1 “Courts may take judicial notice of information that is posted on official public websites of government agencies \nwhen evaluating a motion to dismiss.” Chowdhury v. Blinken, No. 21 -cv-1205 (RCL), 2022 WL 136795, at *1 n.1 \n(D.D.C. Jan. 14, 2022) (citing Ma rkowicz v. Johnson, 206 F. Supp. 3d 158, 161 n.2 (D.D.C. 2016)). The Court will \ntake judicial notice that the Department of State’s Visa Status Check website lists plaintiffs’ visa applications as \n“Refused.” See Visa Status Check , U.S. Dep ’t of St. , https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx  \n[https://perma.cc/NS4H -BST9 ]. This is consistent with plaintiffs’ allegation that their applications have been “refused \nfor administrative processing.” Compl.  ¶ 52; see 221(g) Notice.  Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 2 of 123 instructed to complete Form DS -5535, Supplemental Questions for Visa Applicants, which \nrequires applicants to s ubmit detailed  residential, employment, and travel history.

When  they filed their Complaint , plaintiffs had been waiting six months without \naction by the government ; they have now been waiting fifteen months . As a result, pla intiffs face \n“lack of mentorship from senior leadership in their respective startups, potential loss of \nemployment, and hind[rance]  to their career progression. ” Compl. ¶ 58 . \nB. Procedural History  \nOn May 23, 2023, plaintiffs  filed their Complaint requesting that this Court order  Secretary \nof State, Antony Blinken;  Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services, Julie Stufft ; and \nConsul General of the U.S. Consulate in Montreal, Canada, Ana Escrogima to adjudicate Plaintiffs’ immigrant visa applications. Compl. ¶ 14. Plaintiffs seek relief under the Administrative \nProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), and the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361. On August 23, 2023, \nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject -matter jurisdiction and for failure to state \na claim. Defs.’ Mot.  1, ECF No. 8. After the parties finished bri efing defendants’ motion, plaintiffs \nfiled four  successive notices of supplemental authority, all of which were directed to  out-of-circuit \ndistrict court decisions. ECF Nos. 13, 16, 18, 19. Plaintiffs also filed a self -styled notice of change \nin material facts, directing  the Court’s attention to a sworn declaration from a Department of State \nemployee filed by the government in an unrelated  case that purportedly undermines defendant s’ \nmotion to dismiss.  ECF No. 20. Defendants’ m otion is now ripe for review.  Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 3 of 124 II. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion s to Dismiss  \nA defendant in a civil action may move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1) for “lack of subject -matter jurisdiction.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). A court \nconsidering such a motion must take all the well -pleaded allegations i n the complaint as true and \ndraw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. Sparrow v. United Air Lines, Inc., 216 F.3d \n1111, 1113 (D.C. Cir. 2000). “However, those factual allegations receive closer scrutiny than they do in the Rule 12(b)(6) cont ext,” and “a court that is assessing a motion brought under Rule \n12(b)(1) may look to documents outside of the complaint in order to evaluate whether or not it has jurisdiction to entertain a claim,” including to “resolve factual disputes concerning jurisdiction.” Doe v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 453 F. Supp. 3d 354, 361 (D.D.C. 2020) (K.B. Jackson, J.) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nA defendant in a civil action may also move to dismiss a complaint under Federal Rule of \nCivil Proc edure 12(b)(6) for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12(b)(6). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations, accepted as true, to “state a claim to relief that is plau sible on its face.” Ashcroft v. \nIqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). A claim is plausible on its face if it “pleads factual content that \nallows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. A court eva luating a Rule 12(b)(6) “motion presumes that the complaint ’s factual \nallegations are true and construes them liberally in the plaintiff ’s favor.” Alemu v. Dep ’t of \nFor-Hire Vehicles , 327 F. Supp. 3d 29, 40 (D.D.C. 2018). However, “[a] court need not accept a \nplaintiff ’s legal conclusions as true , nor must a court presume the veracity of legal conclusions that \nare couched as factual allegations.” Id. (citation omitted).  Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 4 of 125 B. Unreasonable Delay  \nPlaintiffs’ APA and mandamus claims  rest on the same theory: that the Department of State \nunreasonably delayed the adjudication of plaintiffs’  visa applications . Compl. ¶¶ 53–57. The APA \ncommands that “within a reasonable time, each agency shall proceed to conclude a matter \npresented to it”  and permits a reviewing court to “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 555(b), 706(1). A court evaluating a claim of unreasonable \ndelay must “consider whether the agency ’s failure to respond is ‘so egregious’ as t o warrant relief.” \nTate v. Pompeo, 513 F. Supp. 3d 132, 147 (D.D.C. 2021) (quoting Telecomms. Rsch. & Action \nCtr. v. FCC  (TRAC ), 750 F.2d 70, 79 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). The D.C. Circuit has identified six factors \nfor courts to consider when making this determination:  \n(1) the time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a rule of reason; \n(2) where Congress has provided a timetable or other indication of the speed with which it expects the agency to proceed in the enabling statute, that statutory schem e \nmay supply content for this rule of reason; (3) delays that might be reasonable in the sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human health and welfare are at stake; (4) the court should consider the effect of expediting delayed action on \nagency activities of a higher or competing priority; (5) the court should also take \ninto account the nature and extent of the interests prejudiced by delay; and (6) the court need not find any impropriety lurking behind agency lassitude in order to hold that agency action is unreasonably delayed.  \nTRAC , 750 F.2d at 80 (internal quotations and citations omitted). “ The standard for undue  delay \nunder the Mandamus Act . . . is identical to the APA standard.” Kangarloo v. Pompeo, \n480 F.  Supp. 3d 134, 142 (D.D.C. 2020) (citing Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All. , 542 U.S. 55, \n63–64 (2004)).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nDefendants raise four arguments for dismissal: (1) plaintiffs lack Article III standing to sue \nthe Secretary of State because he has no role in adjudicating plaintiffs’ visa applications and is \nunable to redress plaintiffs’  alleged injury; (2) the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 5 of 126 the defendants are shielded by the doctrine of consular nonreviewability; (3) the Court lacks \nmandamus jurisdiction because defendants are not subject to a discrete, non -discretionary duty; \nand (4) plaintiffs fail to state a claim because the  alleged delay  is not unreasonable under the \nsix-factor test prescribed in TRAC . Defendants’ first two arguments fail. However, even assuming \ndefendants are subject to a discrete, non- discretionary duty, plaintiffs’ claims fail under Rule \n12(b)(6) because a six (now fifteen) month delay is not unreasonable  as a matter of law . \nA. Article III Standing  \nAlthough defendants do not expressly cast their  argument that the Secretary of State has \n“no role” in adjudicating plaintiffs’ visa  applications in Article III standing terms,  Defs.’ Mot. 4, \nthe Court will construe it as a redressabili ty challenge, see Ark Initiative v. Tidwell, 749 F.3d 1071, \n1075 (D.C. Cir. 2014) ( describing the “‘irreducible constitutional minimum of standing” as “(1) \nan injury in fact that is concrete and particularized as well as actual or imminent; (2) a causal \nconnection between the injury and the challenged conduct; and (3) a likelihood, as opposed to \nmere speculation,  that the injury will be redressed  by a favorable decision”  (quoting Lujan v. Defs.  \nof Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)  (emphasis add ed) (internal quotation marks omitted) )). \nSo construed, defendants’ argument is wholly unpersuasive. “The Immigration and Nationality \nAct, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq. , grants consular officers ‘exclusive authority to review applications \nfor visas, precluding even the Secretary of State from controlling their determinations. ’” Baan Rao \nThai Restaurant v. Pompeo, 985 F.3d 1020, 1024 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (quoting Saavedra Bruno v. Albright , 197 F.3d 1153, 1156 (D.C. Cir.  1999) ). But a lthough “the Secretary of State h as no legal \nauthority to control which visa applications consular officers grant or deny, nothing precludes him \nfrom directing them to decide pending applications ‘within a reasonable time,’ as the APA \nrequires.” Khazaei  v. Blinken , No. 23- cv-1419 (JEB), 2023 WL 6065095, at *4 (D.D.C. Sept. 18, Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 6 of 127 2023); see also  Ahmadi v. Scharpf , No. 23- cv-953 (DLF), 2024 WL 551542, at *4 (D.D.C. Feb. 12, \n2024) . Accordingly, the Secretary of State could redress  the alleged injury to plaintiffs  by directing \nthe timely adjudication of their applications .2 \nB. Consular Nonreviewability \n“Consular nonreviewability shields a consular official ’s decision to issue or withhold a visa \nfrom judicial review , at least unless Congress says otherwise .” Baan Rao, 985 F.3d at 1024 (citing  \nSaavedra Bruno, 197  F.3d at 1159) . Defendants argue that refusing a visa for administrative \nprocessing qualifies as  “withhold[ing]  a visa” within the meaning of Baan Rao. Defs.’ Mot.  12–16  \n(citing Baan Rao, 985 F.3d at 1024) . Courts in this District, including this one, have repeatedly \nrejected the view that consular nonreviewability applies to decisions to provisionally reject  visa \napplications for administrative processing. See, e.g. , Joorabi v. Pompeo, 464  F. Supp. 3d 93, 100 \n(D.D.C.  2020) (Lamberth, J.); Pourabdollah v. Blinken, No. 23-cv-1603 (DLF), 2024 WL 474523, \nat *4 –5 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2024)  (Friedrich, J.);  Sawahreh v. U.S. Dep’t of State , 630 F. Supp. 3d \n155, 159–60 (D.D.C. 2022)  (Boasberg, J.) ; Al-Gharawy v. U.S. Dep’ t of Homeland Sec., \n617 F.  Supp. 3d 1, 11 (D.D.C. 2022)  (Moss., J.) ; Meyou v. U.S. Dep’t of State , No. 21- cv-2806  \n(JDB), 2022 WL 1556344, at *2 (D.D.C . May  17, 2022)  (Bates, J.) ; Giliana v. Blinken, \n596 F.  Supp. 3d 13, 17– 18 (D.D.C. 2022)  (Cooper, J.) . That is what plaintiffs allege happened \nhere. Plaintiffs’ applications were provisionally refused for administrative processing so that \nplaintiffs could  provide supplemental information regarding their residential, employment, and \n \n2 Because the Court has a “special obligation to satisfy [itself] of [its] own jurisdiction,” Cicero v. Mnuchin , 857 F.3d \n407, 415 (D.C. Cir. 2017)  (quoting Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t , 523 U.S. 83, 95 (1998)) , the Court \nadditionally finds that plaintiffs have adequately alleged the violation of “ a procedural right to reasonably expeditious \nagency action  that is tethered to [their]  concrete professional and financial interest[s]” in career progression and \nconti nued employment, see, e.g. , Rahman v. Blinken, No. 22 -cv-2732 (JEB), 2023 WL 196428, at *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 17, \n2023). This suffices to establish injury in fact. See Summers v. Earth Island Inst. , 555 U.S. 488, 496 (2009). Altogether, \nthe Court is satisfied th at plaintiffs have established Article III standing.  Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 7 of 128 travel his tory. Compl. ¶¶ 48–49. Plaintiffs did so but have not yet received a final decision  on their \nvisa applications . Compl. ¶¶ 50 –52. The Court adopts the reasoning of the above decisions  and \nconcludes that consular nonreviewability is inapplicable  under these circumstances . Consular \nnonreviewability does not entitle defendants to dismissal. \nC. Unreasonable Delay \nThe Court has rejected defendants’ standing and consular nonreviewability arguments. \nNevertheless, the Court concludes that defendants are entitled to dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) because plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for unreasonable delay. Courts in this D istrict, \nincluding this one, have repeatedly held that it is  appropriate to grant a motion to dismiss based on \nthe “application of the TRAC  factors to the factual allegations of a complaint asserting a claim of \n‘unreasonable delay.’”  Chowdhury , 2022 WL 136795, at *3 ( quoting Desai v. U.S. Citizenship & \nImmigr. Serv s., No. 20- cv-1005 (CKK), 2021 WL 1110737, at *5 (D.D.C. Mar. 22, 2021) ).\n3 \nOrdinarily, before assessing the unreasonableness of a n alleged  delay, the Court would undertake \nto determine whether plaintif fs assert “a discrete  agency action that [the agency]  is required  to \ntake.” Norton, 542 U.S. at 64. But the Court need not resolve  that question because defendants \nwould still be entitled to dismissal even if it were answered affirmatively.  See, e.g., Pourabdollah, \n2024 WL 474523, at *6 & n.5 ( turning to the unreasonableness of the alleged delay after assuming  \nwithout deciding the existence of a “discrete, required duty” ). Applying the TRAC  factors to the \n \n3 Plaintiffs refused to address the TRAC  factors in their opposition because their “[u]nreasonable delay claims require \nfact-based inquiries not suitable for disposition at this stage of litigation.” Pls.’ Opp’n 22, ECF No. 10 . But “Courts \nin this district have routinely decided whether an agency’s delay is unreasonable when processing claims at the motion-\nto-dismiss -stage.” Ahmadi , 2024 WL 551542, at *5 n.8 (first citing Palakuru v. Renaud, 521 F. Supp.  3d 46, 50 \n(D.D.C. 2021) (collecting cases); and then citing Khan v. Blome , No. 22 -cv-2422 (JEB), 2022 WL 17262219, at *4 \n(D.D.C. Nov. 29, 2022) ). The Court deems defendants’ unreasonable delay arguments conceded and, given plaintiffs’ \ntotal failure to eng age with defendants’ TRAC factors analysis, declines to consider any substantive arguments later \nraised in plaintiffs’ notices of supplemental authority.  See Brett v. Brennan , 404 F. Supp. 3d 52, 59 (D.D.C. 2019) (“It \nis well- understood that ‘if a party files an opposition to a motion and therein addresses only some of the movant ’s \narguments, the court may treat the unaddressed arguments as conceded. ’” (quoting Wannall v. Hone ywell , Inc., \n775 F.3d 425, 428 (D.C. Cir. 2014)) . Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 8 of 129 allegations in the C omplaint and judicially noticeable facts, this Court agrees that plaintiffs have \nfailed to plausibly allege  that the delayed adjudication of their  application s was unreasonable.  \n1. TRAC Factors 1 and 2 \nThe first TRAC  factor, which commands that the time agencies take to make decisions must \nbe governed by a rule of reason, is the “most important.” In re Core Commc ’ns, Inc., 531 F.3d \n849, 855 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The second TRAC  factor “provides that the content of such a rule [of \nreason] may be found in a ‘ timetable or other indication  . . . in the enabling statute.’” Ctr. for Sci. \nin the Pub. Int. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 74 F. Supp. 3d 295, 300 (D.D.C. 2014) (quoting \nTRAC , 750 F.2d at 80). Put together, these factors “get at w hether the agency ’s response time \ncomplies with an existing specified schedule and whether it is governed by an identifiable \nrationale” and whether there is any “rhyme or reason” for the agency ’s delay. Id.  \nThe first and second factors favor defendants. Pl aintiffs do not contest that “[t]here is no \nstatutory or regulatory timeframe within which the State Department or a consular officer must  \n[adjudicate] . . . the visa applications at issue.” See Defs.’ Mot. 18–19; Pls.’ Opp’n 22–23. Lacking \na statutory timeline, courts “typically turn to case law as a guide.” Sarlak v. Pompeo, No . 20-cv-35 \n(BAH), 2020 WL 3082018, at *6 (D.D.C. June 10, 2020). “ [D]istrict courts have generally found \nthat immigration delays in excess of five, six, seven years are unreasonable, while those between three to five years are often not unreasonable.” Rahman, 2023 WL 196428, at *4 ( quoting \nSawahreh, 2022 WL 4365746, at *5). Recall  that plaintiffs had been waiting for only six months  \nbefore  they filed  their Complaint; now, they have been waiting for fifteen months .\n4 That delay is \n \n4 Plaintiffs argue  in one of their notices of supplemental authority that the length of delay should be measured from \nthe date that plaintiffs submitted their initial Form I -140 petition, not the date of plaintiffs’ visa interview. ECF No.  16, \nat 2. Setting aside that plaintiffs waived this argument, Courts in this Distric t routinely analyze delay claims based on \nthe date of placement in administrative processing, not the date that plaintiffs filed their application. See, e.g. , Dastagir \nv. Blinken , 557 F. S upp. 3d 160, 165 (D.D.C. 2021) (measuring from date visa application was refused for \nadministrative processing).  Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 9 of 1210 reasonable under the circumstances. See, e.g. , Mohammad v. Blinken, No. 20- cv-3696 (TNM), \n2021 WL 2866058, at *4 (D.D.C. July 8, 2021)  (finding a delay of “less than two years . . . ‘ not \nunreasonable as a matter of law, given the circumstances ’” (quoting Bagherian v. Pompeo, \n442 F . Supp. 3d 87, 95 (D.D.C. 2020)).  \n2. TRAC Factor 4  \nThe fourth TRAC  factor, which asks the Court to consider the effect of expediting delayed \naction on agency activities of a higher or competing priority , strongly weighs in defendants ’ favor. \n“Where the agency action sought is one of many similar adjudications that the agency must \ncomplete, the court should be even more cautious before intervening.”  Skalka  v. Kelly, \n246 F.  Supp. 3d. 147, 153 (D.D.C. 2017) . That is because  “[c]ourts are generally hesitant to direct \nagencies which tasks to prioritize, particularly if such intervention would move the petitioner to ‘the head of the queue’ and ‘simply move [] all others back one space.’” Pourabdollah, 2024 WL \n474523, at *7 (quoting In re Barr Lab’ys, Inc., 930 F.2d 72, 75–76 (D.C. Cir. 1991)).\n5 \nConsequently, t his factor “often  . . . carries the greatest weight .” Da Costa v. Immigr. Inv. \nProgram Off., 643 F. Supp. 3d 1, 15 (D.D.C. 2022) (citing Milligan v. Pompeo, 502 F. Supp. 3d \n302, 319 (D.D.C. 2020)), aff’d , 80 F.4th 330 (D.C. Cir. 2023). Although the government seemingly \nackno wledges  that the  effect of prioritizing two visa applications on agency resources may  be \nminimal,  see Defs.’ Mot. 22, the “ accumulation of such individual cases being pushed by judicial \nfiat to the front of the line would erode the ability of agencies to determine their priorities ,” Tate, \n \n5 Plaintiffs filed a self -styled notice of change in material facts in which they suggest  that the  government, by way of \na declaration filed in an unrelated case, has acknowledged that “there [is] no queue in na tional security vetting .” ECF \nNo. 20, at 1. But even if no such “queue” in fact exists, the critical point is that agencies get to prioritize their  projects \nand allocate their resources. See In re Barr , 930 F.2d at 76  (“The agency is in a unique —and authoritative —position \nto views its projects as a whole, estimate the prospects for each, and allocate its resources in the optimal way.’) . \nPlaintiffs offer no p ersuasive reason to reject  defendants’ representation that pri oritizing these applications would \nnecessarily come at the expense of other similarly situated applicants.  Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 10 of 1211 513 F. Supp. 3d at 150. And a court order prioritizing  plaintiffs’ applications , unaccompanied by \nany “net gain” in visa application processing, would necessarily be “to the detriment of other \nsimilarly situated visa applicants.” Id.  at 149 (quoting Sarlak , 2020 WL 3082018, at *6); Thakker  \nv. Renaud, No. 20- cv-1133 (CKK), 2021 WL 1092269, at *7 (D.D.C. Mar. 22, 2021). This Court \ntakes  pause before blithely  “reordering agency priorities .” See In re Barr , 930 F.2d at 76.  \n3. TRAC Factors 3 and 5 \n“The third and fifth factors are often considered together, and require the Court to consider \nplaintiffs’ interests, health, and welfare.” Chowdhury , 2022 WL 136795, at *4 (alteration brackets \nomitted) (quoting Thakker , 2021 WL 1092269, at *7) . These factors slightly  weigh in favor of \nplaintiffs. Plaintiffs contend that they presently face “lack of mentorship from senior leadership in \ntheir respective startups, potential los s of employment, and hind[rance] to their career \nprogression.” Compl. ¶ 58. Plaintiffs also allege that they have been unable to “fully focus on their \nwork.” Compl. ¶ 10. “Taking these alleged adverse effects as true, as the Court must at this stage, \nthe p laintiffs are in a worse position tha n visa applicants who merely claim that their lives have \nbeen put ‘on hold’ by the visa delay.” Pourabdollah, 2024 WL 474523, at *8 (internal citation \nomitted) (quoting Palakuru, 521 F. Supp. 3d at 53). This factor is o nly slightly beneficial to \nplaintiffs, however, because the alleged adverse effects are relatively minor compared to other employment visa applicants. See e.g., Da Costa, 643 F. Supp. 3d at 15 (noting that delay forced \nplaintiffs to remain in city where th ey “fear for their lives each time they venture out their front \ndoor” and where “residents’ access to drinking water, electricity, and other public services is substantially limited”  (citations omitted)).  \n  Case 1:23-cv-01472-RCL   Document 23   Filed 03/05/24   Page 11 of 124. TRAC Factor 6 \nThe last TRAC factor asks whether the agency has acted in bad faith. Fakhimi v. U.S. Dep 't \nof State, No. 23-cv-1127 (CKK), 2023 WL 6976073, at *11 (D.D.C. Oct. 23, 2023). The Circuit \nhas cautioned that a finding of bad faith or impropriety is not necessary to hold that an agency \naction is unreasonably delayed. TRAC, 750 F.2d at 80. In any event, plaintiffs have not alleged bad \nfaith on the part of defendants. Accordingly, this factor is neutral. See Chowdhury, 2022 WL \n136795, at *5. \n*** \nThe Court sympathizes with plaintiffs. They are obviously highly talented individuals, and \nthe delays in visa processing are interfering with their career progression and ability to contribute \nto artificial intelligence research in the United States. However, the TRAC factors on balance favor \ndefendants. Plaintiffs, therefore, have failed to state a claim for unreasonable delay under the AP A. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court will GRANT defendants' motion to dismiss. A \nseparate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue. \nDate: March~' 2024 \nRoyce C.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied Reginald Statom's motion for early termination of supervised release after considering his criminal history, including compliance failures during previous supervision, as well as his use of possibly inaccurate legal citations that appear to have been generated by AI. Statom failed to demonstrate any extraordinary circumstances for early termination, with the court emphasizing that AI-generated content raised doubts about the motion's credibility and accuracy.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Reginald Statom's supervised release should be terminated early based on his conduct and any new, unforeseen circumstances that render continued supervision unnecessary.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that early termination of supervised release was not warranted, as Statom had not shown new or unforeseen circumstances justifying such relief and his inadequate past compliance does not support early release. Concerns about the AI-generated content in his filing further compromised the motion's credibility.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're on probation after getting into trouble, and you ask to get off probation early because you followed the rules for a little while and have a job opportunity. However, in your request, you used a computer program to quickly make up stuff that wasn’t true, like fake case examples. The judge didn’t let you off early because you haven’t been supervised long enough and haven’t shown a really good reason to stop. Plus, the use of made-up details made the judge question if your request was truthful.",

Hon. Brandy R. McMillion  \n        United States District Judge  \nREGINALD STATOM , et al. ,  \n \nDefendant. \n__________________________________/  \n \nOPINION AND ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR EAR LY \nTERMINATION OF SUPERVISED RELEASE   \n \nBefore the Court is Defendant Reginal Statom ’s (“Statom ”) Motion for Early \nTermination of Supervised Release.  See  ECF No. 301 .  The Government filed a \nresponse objecting to the request for early termination.  See  ECF No. 303.   The \nCourt, having reviewed the parties’ briefs and the record , has determined that a \nhearing is not necessary.   See E.D. Mich.  LR 7.1(f) .  For the reasons stated below, \nthe Court DENIES  the Motion.  \nI. \n In October  2009 , Statom pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of conspiracy to \npossess  with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine .  See  ECF No. \n112.  He was sentenced to a 2 05-month  guidelines sentence; with a ten -year term of \nsupervision to follow .  See ECF No. 142,  PageID. 427-428.  In May 2020 , Statom Case 2:08-cr-20669-BRM-MKM   ECF No. 304, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 07/28/25   Page 1 of 72 moved for compassionate release , but that motion was denied.  ECF No s. 287, 290.1  \nIn January 2021, Statom was prematurely released to home confinement but later \nreturned to a custodial setting.  See ECF No. 294.  He filed a motion asking the Court \nto order home confinement, but that motion was denied as the Court lacks \njurisdiction to mandate the Bureau of Prisons on prisoner placement, including home \nconfinement.  See generally  ECF Nos. 294, 299.  In August 2022, Statom was \nreleased  to the custody of the Detroit Areas Community Corrections Center and  then \nplaced on supervised release  on May 18, 2023.  ECF No. 301, PageID.2248.   \nSince his release, Statom claims that he has “maintained continuous \nemployment, and fulfilled all conditions imposed during supervised release.”  ECF \nNo. 301, PageID.2248.  He reports that he has “a strong opportunity to obtain full -\ntime employment with a freight company –  an opportunity contingent upon the \ntermination of his supervised release due to the company’s insurance and employment eligibility policies.”  Id .  As a result,  he is asking the Court to terminate \nhis supervision.  The government objects to early termination, arguing that Statom \nhas only completed one -quarter of his term of supervision; he has performed poorly \non supervision in the past, including committing the instant drug offense while he \nwas on a previous term of federal supervision; and he has failed to raise any new \n \n1 A motion for reconsideration on Statom’s request for compassionate release was also denied.  \nSee ECF Nos. 291, 292.  Case 2:08-cr-20669-BRM-MKM   ECF No. 304, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 07/28/25   Page 2 of 73 circumstances of life conditions that make it unduly burdensome to continue with \nsupervision, including producing any information to substantiate that the \nemployment opportunity.  ECF No. 303, PageID.2254 -2255.   \nII. \n“Supervised release is part of a sentence.”  United States v. Krul, 774 F.3d \n371, 374 (6th Cir. 2014).  However, under 18 U.S.C. 3583(e)(1), after a defendant \nhas served at least one year of a term of supervised release, the Court may order \nearly termination  if the Court “is satisfied that such action is warranted by the \nconduct of the defendant released and the interest of justice.”  United States v. Suber, \n75 F. App’x 442, 444 (6th Cir. 2003) ; 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(1) .  When making this \ndetermination, the C ourt considers the following sentencing factors outline d in 18 \nU.S.C. § 35 53, which include:  \n• the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and \ncharacteristics of the defendant;  \n• the need to afford adequate deterrence; the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correcti onal treatment;  \n• the kind of sentence and the sentencing range established for the applicable category of offense committed by the applicable \ncategory defendant;  \n• any pertinent policy statement issued by the United States Sentencing Commission; the need to avoid unwarranted sentence \ndisparities; and \n• the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.   Case 2:08-cr-20669-BRM-MKM   ECF No. 304, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 07/28/25   Page 3 of 74 See § 3583(e)  (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(C), (a)(2)(D), (a)(4), \n(a)(5), (a)(6), and (a)(7)).   \nIII. \nStatom  argues that “early termination of his supervised release is warranted \nin this case ” because  “he no longer needs monitoring to ensure compliance with the \nlaw, and further supervision would serve no rehabilitat ive purpose. ”  ECF  No. 301 , \nPageID. 2251 .  Statom relies on “ United States v. Atkin, 38 F. Supp. 2d 938, 939 -40 \n(S.D. Ind. 1999)” and “ United States v. Harris, No. 07 -20499, 2020 WL 6054876 \n(E.D. Mich. Oct. 14, 2020)” in support of his motion.  Id.  at PageID.2249 -2250.  The \nCourt believes that Statom used some form of generative artificial intelligence \n(“AI”) to complete this filing – as neither of these are actual cases that stand for the \npropositions in which they are cited.  \nThe citation 38 F. Supp. 2d 938 is to a civil not criminal, District of Kansas \ncase ( Neide v. Grand Court Lifestyles, Inc. ).  The Court did a search for United States \nv. Atkin  in the Southern District of Indiana and no such case exists.  Similarly, United \nStates v. Harris  is alleged to be an Eastern District of Michigan case, bearing case \nnumber 07- 20499.  In addition to searching Westlaw for 2020 WL 6054876, which \ndoes not return any cases, the Court also searched  the internal EDMI system for Case \nNo. 07 -20499.  While this is a criminal case, it is the matter of United States v. Rose , \nnot United States v. Harris.  And while there is an order terminating supervised Case 2:08-cr-20669-BRM-MKM   ECF No. 304, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 07/28/25   Page 4 of 75 release early in that case, it is not for the reasons cited and it is from 2018 not 2020.  \nThese inaccuracies and falsehoods lead the Court to believe that Statom used AI in \ngenerating his submission to the Court.   The Court therefore questions the accuracy \nof any of the information contained in Statom’s request and for that reason alone , \nhis Motion should be denied.  \nNonetheless, Statom’s request for early termination of supervision should also \nbe denied on its merits.  While  the Court notes Statom’s alleged progress while on \nsupervision , it fails to find that these actions are sufficient to warrant early \ntermination.   As a general matter, “compliance is expected, not exceptional, \nbehavior.”  United States v. McDonald, No. 2:22 -cr-20646, 2024 WL 5337829, at \n*2 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 20, 2024).  F ull compliance with the terms of supervised release, \ntherefore, does not warrant early termination.  United States v. Kilpatrick , No. 2:10-\ncr-20403, 2023 WL 1487337, at *2 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 2, 2023) (citation omitted).  \n“Similarly, prod uctive employment, while laudable, does not justify the termination \nof supervision.”  United States v. Laughton , 658 F. Supp. 3d 540, 544  (E.D. Mich. \n2023)  (intern al quotation  marks  and citations omitted).  Generally, e arly termination \n“will be proper only when the sentencing judge is satisfied that new or unforeseen \ncircumstances warrant it.”  See Kilpatr ick, 2023 WL 1487337, at  *2 (quotation \nmarks and citation omitted).  Case 2:08-cr-20669-BRM-MKM   ECF No. 304, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 07/28/25   Page 5 of 76 Here, Statom  has not identified any new of unforeseen circumstances that \nwould warrant early termination of supervised release.  In fact, evaluating the § \n3553(a) factors identified in 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e) , the Court finds that early \ntermination would not be in the interest of justice.  The nature and circumstances of \nthe offense and Statom’s history and characteristics strongly favor a lengthy term of \nsupervision.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3353(a)(1).   Statom was charged with this drug offense \nwhile he was on federa l supervision for a previous drug conviction.  He has \npreviously demonstrated that he has issues with compliance with his terms of \nsupervision.  Similarly, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B) requires to Court to look at \nwhether his term of supervision would provide adequate deterrence.  The Court is \nnot convinced that Staton has served enough of his term to be fully deterred.  He has \nonly completed one -quarter of the imposed term.  More time on supervision is likely \nto ensure that he does not reoffend and that he is not granted an unwarranted \nsentencing disparity compared to similarly situated defendants.  See 18 U.S.C. § \n3553(a)(6).  If the Court were to grant his request, he would be afforded over a three -\nquarter  reduction in his term of supervision, which would not be in accordance with \nothers similarly convicted of serious drug crimes.  \nAccordingly, it is ORDER ED that the Defendant’s Motion for Early \nTermination of Supervised Release (ECF No. 301 ) is DENIED .  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.

Miller filed a lawsuit against the Kansas Department of Children and Families (DCF) and associated individuals, alleging violations of her civil rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act, among other claims. The case involves AI, as a state court judge imposed an AI certification rule requiring Miller to disclose her use of AI in legal pleadings, allegedly obstructing her access to justice. The court ruled against her Ex Parte Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction due to lack of notice to the defendants.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the plaintiff is entitled to an ex parte temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction against the dissemination and enforcement of the DCF's findings due to alleged harm from her social media activities.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court denied the plaintiff's motions for both an ex parte temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction because she did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances that would justify proceeding without notifying the opposing parties.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Basically, a mom named Meghann, who was fighting to get her kids back, asked the court for an emergency order to stop a department from using certain information against her. She said this info was false and wanted it removed from their records. Also, using artificial intelligence (AI), the court was trying to make her say whether she had used AI to help write her court papers.

On \nMarch 21, 2025, plaintiff filed suit pro se against the Kansas Depa rtment of Children and Families \n(“DCF”), and various individuals who are either DCF employees or provide services for DCF.  \nPlaintiff alleges violat ion of her civil rights  under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985 and 1986, violation of \nher rights under the Americans Wi th Disabilities, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. and various state law \nclaims.1  This matter is before the Court on plaint iff’s Ex Parte Emergenc y Motion For Temporary \nRestraining Order And Preliminary Injunction (Doc . #5) filed March 21, 2025.  For reasons stated \nbelow, the Court overrul es plaintiff’s motion.  \n \n 1  The Court affords a pro se plaintiff so me leniency and liberally construes her \nfilings.  See James v. Wadas, 724 F.3d 1312, 1315 (10th Cir. 2013).  Although the Court holds a \npro se litigant’s filings to a less stringent standard than formal pl eadings drafted by attorneys, a \npro se party must follow the same rules of procedure as all other litigants.  See Garrett v. Selby \nConnor Maddux & Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005). Case 2:25-cv-02145-KHV-TJJ     Document 22     Filed 06/23/25     Page 1 of 5  \n \n \n \n-2- \n  Factual Background \n Highly summarized, plaintiff’ s First Amended Verified Complaint (Doc. #13) filed May 8, \n2025, alleges as follows:   \n In the District Court of Johnson County, Ka nsas, plaintiff and her ex-husband have a \npending dispute which involves the custody of th eir five children.  On January 29, 2024, based on \nunsubstantiated allegations of abus e and without an evidentiary hear ing or notice to plaintiff, the \nHonorable Keven O’Grady of the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas, ordered that plaintiff \nnot have contact with her child ren.  Before January 29, 2024, Michel le Merritt, a DCF investigator, \ninformed Randy McCalla, the guardian ad litem, that  the abuse allegations against plaintiff were \nunsubstantiated.  Even so, McCalla sought to re move the children from pl aintiff’s custody.  On \nJune 5, 2024, Merritt told plainti ff that the abuse allegations were unfounded.  Even so, unknown \nDCF supervisors blocked disclosure of  this fact to the state court. \n On January 22, 2025, after repeated efforts by pl aintiff to correct th e record, DCF general \ncounsel sent plaintiff a letter which acknowledged that it had previously cl osed the investigation \nbecause the allegations against her were unsubstantiated.  On January 23, 2025, DCF received a new re port which alleged emotional harm to \nplaintiff’s children from her soci al media activity.  On March 18, 2025, in reliance on fabricated \nevidence, Ashley Beauchamp, a DCF social worker, without interviewing plai ntiff, concluded that \nthe allegations of harm to her children were substantiated.   \n On April 1, 2025, some three week s before a scheduled trial of  the custody dispute, Judge \nO’Grady canceled trial because pl aintiff had not paid outstanding guardian ad litem fees.  On \nApril 4, 2025, for punitive reasons, Judge O’Gra dy imposed a selective Artificial Intelligence \n(“AI”) certification rule, which mandat ed that plaintiff disclose her us e of AI in pleadings.  Plaintiff Case 2:25-cv-02145-KHV-TJJ     Document 22     Filed 06/23/25     Page 2 of 5  \n \n \n \n-3- \n  alleges that the AI certification rule  obstructed her access to the courts. \n On March 21, 2025, plaintiff filed this suit agai nst DCF and others associated with DCF.  \nOn April 7, 2025, plaintiff filed a se parate suit against the guardian ad litem, the court-appointed \ntherapist, a psychologist who ev aluated plaintiff and Johnson County.  See Miller v. McCalla, D. \nKan. No. 25-2180-KHV.  \n  Since January 29, 2024, except for limited weekly reunification sessi ons with her three \nyoungest children, plaintiff has been separate d from her children (ages 17, 14, 12, 11 and 11). \n In a nine-count amended comp laint, plaintiff alleges viola tion of her civ il rights under \n42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985 and 1986, viol ation of her rights under the Americans With Disabilities, \n42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. and various state law clai ms.  The gravamen of pl aintiff’s complaint is \nthat the guardian ad l item and others in the custody dis pute misled Judge O’Grady.  Although \nplaintiff has not named Judge O’Grady as a defenda nt, she alleges that his conduct has “obstructed \nher access to justice.”  Firs t Amended Verified Complaint (Doc. #13) at 6, 8.     \nAnalysis \nI. Motion For Ex Parte Te mporary Restraining Order \n Plaintiff seeks an ex parte temporary restra ining order which (1) enjoins defendants from \ndisseminating, relying on, or en forcing the DCF finding on March 18, 2025, that the allegations of \nharm to plaintiff’s children from her social media activity were substantiated, (2) orders immediate removal of the DCF finding from its central regist ry, (3) prohibits the us e of the DCF finding in \nany ongoing legal, administrative or custody proceed ing and (4) directs defendants to annotate all \nDCF records indicating that the DC F finding is subject to pending fede ral judicial review.  An ex \nparte temporary restraining orde r is an emergency remedy, whic h is reserved for exceptional \ncircumstances and lasts only unt il the Court can hear argument s or evidence regarding the Case 2:25-cv-02145-KHV-TJJ     Document 22     Filed 06/23/25     Page 3 of 5  \n \n \n \n-4- \n  controversy.  Uhlig, LLC v. PropLogix, LLC, No. 22-2475-KHV, 2023 WL 8452426, at *1 (D. \nKan. Dec. 6, 2023).  Plaintiff has not shown exce ptional circumstances wh ich would permit the \nCourt to hear her request without notice to the opp osing parties.  See Granny Goose Foods, Inc. v. \nTeamsters, 415 U.S. 423, 438–39 (1974)  (ex parte temporary restrain ing orders run counter to \nprinciples that all parties rece ive reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard; restricted to \nserving underlying purposes of pr eserving status quo and preventing irreparable harm only so long \nas necessary to hold hearing and no longer).  Specifically, she has not explained how notice to \nopposing parties would result in immediate, irreparable harm su ch that notice would “render \nfruitless the further pros ecution of the action.”  Reno Air R acing Ass’n, Inc. v. McCord, 452 F.3d \n1126, 1131 (9th Cir. 2006) (quotations and citati on omitted) (very few circumstances justify \nissuance of ex parte TRO).  The Court therefor e overrules plaintiff’s re quest for an ex parte \ntemporary restraining order. \nII. Motion For Preliminary Injunction \n Plaintiff also seeks a preliminary inj unction which (1) enjoins defendants from \ndisseminating, relying on, or en forcing the DCF finding on March 18, 2025, that the allegations of \nharm to plaintiff’s children from her social media activity were substantiated, (2) orders immediate removal of the DCF finding from its central regist ry, (3) prohibits the us e of the DCF finding in \nany ongoing legal, administrative or custody proceed ing and (4) directs defendants to annotate all \nDCF records indicating that the DCF finding is su bject to pending federa l judicial review.  A \npreliminary injunction is an order issued “only on notice to the adverse party.”  Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 65(a)(1).  Because plaintiff fi led her motion ex parte, defendants  apparently have not received \nnotice and they have not had an opportunity to respond to the mer its of plaintiff’s  request.  The \nCourt therefore overrules without prejudice her request for a prel iminary injunction.  Also, because Case 2:25-cv-02145-KHV-TJJ     Document 22     Filed 06/23/25     Page 4 of 5  \n \n \n \n-5- \n  plaintiff has not shown any need to keep her ex parte motion under seal, the Court directs the Clerk \nto unseal it.  IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  that plaintiff’s Ex Parte Emergency Motion For \nTemporary Restraining Order A nd Preliminary Injunction (Doc . #5) filed March 21, 2025 is \nOVERRULED .  The Clerk is directed to unseal plaint iff’s Ex Parte Emergency Motion For \nTemporary Restraining Order And Preliminar y Injunction (Doc. #5) filed March 21, 2025.  \n Dated this 20th day of June, 2025 at Kansas City, Kansas. \n       s /  K a t h r y n  H .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In Mazile v. Larkin University Corp. and ExamSoft Worldwide, Inc., Plaintiff Christelle Mazile, a doctoral student, claims that ExamSoft's AI-proctored exams led to false cheating allegations and her expulsion from Larkin University. The court ruled that Mazile's claims against ExamSoft must go to arbitration due to a binding arbitration clause in the clickwrap agreement she signed. Additionally, the court dismissed her claims against Larkin University for discrimination under the ADA and RA, among others, for failing to establish Larkin as a state actor or show that the university knew of any alleged discriminatory effects of the ExamSoft software.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the arbitration clause in the ExamSoft EULA is enforceable and whether Plaintiff's allegations state a valid claim of discrimination against Larkin University under various statutes, considering the use of AI in ExamSoft's software.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court compelled arbitration for the claims against ExamSoft, enforcing the arbitration clause in the EULA, and dismissed the Plaintiff’s claims against Larkin University. The dismissal was with prejudice regarding the § 1983 claim, finding Larkin is not a state actor, and without prejudice regarding the other discrimination claims, finding insufficient evidence for wrongful discrimination against Plaintiff due to her disabilities.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Christelle Mazile said a computer program in her university's online exam system incorrectly flagged her as a cheater, which led to her getting kicked out of school. She tried to sue both the university and the company behind the exam software. The court said she agreed to settle any issues with the software company in a special way (arbitration) when she clicked \"I agree\" before taking the test, so she has to handle that part outside court. As for the university, the court ruled her claims weren’t detailed enough to move forward, though she might get a second chance to explain them better in some cases.",
    "full_text": " \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA \n \nCASE NO. 1:2 3-cv-23306- LEIBOWITZ  \n \nCHRISTELLE MAZILE,  \n  Plaintiff,  \nv. \n LARKIN UNIVERSITY CORP. and  \nEXAMSOFT WORLDWIDE, INC. , \n  Defendants. \n______________________________________________/  \nORDER \n  THIS CAUSE comes before the Court on Defendants’ Motion to Compel Arbitration or, \nin the Alternative, Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint (the “Motion”), filed on May 9, 2024.  \n[ECF No. 34].  Being fully advised, the Motion [ ECF No. 34] is GRANTED.  \nI. BACKGROUND Plaintiff Christelle Mazile  attended Defendant Larkin University Corp. (“Larkin”) to \nobtain a doctorate degree in the ir pharmaceutical program, with an expected graduation date of \nMay 2021.  [ Compl. ¶ 11].  Mazile describes herself as an “African American female with \ndiagnosed anxiety and ADHD.”  [ Id.]   \nLarkin is a Florida non-profit corporation engaged in providing higher education services, \nand Larkin received forgivable loans from the federal  government via the Paycheck Protection \nProgram (“PPP”).  [Id . ¶¶ 2-3, 95c].   \nDefendant ExamSoft Worldwide, Inc. (“ExamSoft”), is a for -profit Texas corporation that \ncreates testin g software that Larkin use d to administer remote examinations for its classes .  [Id. ¶¶ \n2-3].   Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 1 of 242 \n In the Spring of 2020, Mazile was scheduled to take her final examinations  at Larkin  in \nthree classes.  [ Id. ¶ 13].  She initially took examinations for these classes in person (without using \nExamSoft software ) but failed to achieve passing grades .  [Id. ¶¶ 16, 18].  As a result, Larkin \nrequired her to take remediation examinations.  [ Id. ¶¶ 20].  At the time of the remediation testing  \nand due to  the COVID-19 pandemic , Larkin arranged to have the ir students take  examinations \nremotely by using  ExamSoft software.  [ Id. ¶ 15].  T he ExamSoft software created “a continuous \naudio and video recording of the exam -taker using both webcam and screen capture, ” and after the \nexam was  completed the footage was  uploaded to ExamSoft for review by an artificial intelligence \nsystem to identify any potential irregular behavior.  [ Id. ¶ 25].  In  May 2020, Plaintiff took these \nexaminations remotely using ExamSoft ; she was not given an option by Larkin to take her \nexaminations in any other  manner.1  [Id. ¶¶ 21-24, 29].  After taking her remediation exams , \nExamSoft “flagged” Mazile for cheating, and she was expelled by Larkin as a result .  [Id. ¶¶ 30-\n31].   \nTo take her remote examinations using ExamSoft, Plaintiff signed a n Exam Soft \n“clickwrap” agreement, known as the End User Licensing Agreement (“EULA”), by checking a \nbox on her computer screen.  [ECF No. 36 at 7].  The EULA inc luded a clause mandating binding \narbitration for “any claim, demand, dispute or controversy of any kind or nature between the parties \nhereto arising out of or relating to this Agreement, its construction, interpretation, performance or alleged breach” that  is “not otherwise settled by agreement of the parties” (the “Arbitration \nClause”).  [ Compl., Ex. C  at 36].  The Arbitration Clause include d a choice-of- law clause \n \n1 In her Complaint, Mazile  claims to have taken the same remediation exams at different \ntimes.   At some points she claims they occurred in May 2020, and at other points she claims they \ntook place in May 2021.  [Compl. ¶¶ 21, 29, 30, 39, 50].   Because she admits in her response to \nDefendants’ Motion that the examinations occurred in May 2020, this Court will assume as such.  \n[See ECF No. 36 at 16].  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 2 of 243 \n specifying that Texas law applie d to any dispute “without regard to its conflict of laws rules.”  \n[Id.].   \nAs part of the expulsion determination, Mazile alleges that Larkin refused to allow her to \nretest, in person or otherwise, and refused to “consider or investigate her claims that the  \n[ExamSoft] Software had a discriminatory effect based on her race, as well as her ADHD and \nanxiety.”  [ Id. ¶ 32].  Mazile points out that ExamSoft ha d drawn  criticism “as early as December \nof 2020,” when six United States Senators wrote a letter to ExamSo ft expressing their concerns \nthat the ExamSoft software was accusing students of color  and those with disabilities  of cheating  \ndisproportionately.  [ Id., Ex. A at 19- 22].  Mazile also alleges that  “[n]umerous other articles, \nstories, or publications have been made which evidence a clear pattern of the [ExamSoft] Software, and its undoubted discriminatory effect on African America (sic) students, and those with disabilities.”  [ Id. ¶ 28].  \nMazile’s Amended Complaint contains seven counts .  Four counts are aga inst Larkin, \nalleging discrimination and failure -to-accommodate claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (“ADA”), and the Rehabilitation Act (“RA”) .  Three counts are against \nExamSoft, alleging intentional and negligent misreprese ntation and breach of warranty claims \nunder state law.  [ECF No. 16, Compl. ¶¶ 33- 104]. \nII. The Motion to Compel Arbitration  by ExamSoft  is GRANTED.  \nAs part of the Motion, ExamSoft moved to compel arbitration for the claims against it, \nclaiming that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) requires Plaintiff to submit her claims against ExamSoft to binding arbitration.  [ECF No. 34 at 3].  For the reasons tha t follow, this Court agrees  \nwith ExamSoft; these three counts must be decided in arbitration. \n Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 3 of 244 \n A. Legal Standard  \nUnder the FAA, “[a] written provision in any . . . contract evidencing a transaction \ninvolving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy the reafter arising out of such contract or \ntransaction . . . shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law \nor in equity for the revocation of any contract [.]”  9 U.S.C. § 2.  “Confronted with a facially valid \narbitration  agreement, district courts shall  direct the parties to proceed to arbitration on issues as \nto which an arbitration agreement has been signed.”  Calcaterra v. Baptist Health S. Fla., Inc., No. 1:23- CV-20364- KMM, 2024 WL 2109349, at *2 (S.D. Fla. May 9, 2024) (emphasis in original); \n9 U.S.C. § 3.  “A motion to compel arbitration is treated generally as a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.”  Calcaterra , 2024 \nWL 2109349, at *2 (citing Shea v. BBV A Compass Bancshares, Inc., 2013 WL 869526 at *2 n.3 \n(S.D. Fla. Mar. 7, 2013)).  Thus, a court “may consider matters outside the four corners of the complaint.”  Id . (citing Mamani v. Sanchez Berzain, 636 F. Supp. 2d 1326, 1329 (S.D. Fla. 2009)).  \nCourts s hould only compel arbitration if (a) the agreement is enforceable under “ordinary state -\nlaw contract principles” and (b) the claims before the court fall within the scope of that agreement.  Lambert v. Signature Healthcare , LLC, No. 19 -11900, 2022 WL 2571959, at *4 (11th Cir. July 8, \n2022). \nB. Discussion  \nIn diversity actions, this  Court is required to apply the forum state’s conflict -of-law rules.  \nDoe v. Roe , 500 F. Supp. 3d 1319, 1324 (S.D. Fla. 2020), aff'd , No. 20 -14456, 2022 WL 1447378 \n(11th Cir. May 9, 2022) (citing Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elect. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 496 (1941)).  In Florida, “[w]hen a false conflict exists, the law of the forum state –Florida –applies.”  Id . (citing \nCavic v. Grand Bahama Dev. Co. , 701 F.2d 879, 882 (11th Cir. 1983)).  A “false conflict exists Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 4 of 245 \n where the laws of the interested jurisdictions would produce the same outcome[.]”  Id . (quotation \nmarks omitted).   \nMazile claims that both the choice -of-law provision and the Arbitration Clause are \nunconscionable.  [ See ECF No. 36 at 5].  This Court will review  the substantive law of \nunconscionability in both Florida and Texas to determine whether there is a “false conflict ,” such \nthat both courts in both states would “produce the same outcome” when deciding whether the \nchoice- of-law provision and the Arbitration Clause in the EULA are unconscionable.  If so, the \nCourt will apply Florida law. \n1. Substantive Law - Unconscionability  \n Florida Law \nUnder Florida law, “[w]hether an arbit ration provision is unconscionable is a question of \nstate law and therefore the provision is interpreted according to state law rules of contract \nconstruction.”  Valiente v. StockX, Inc. , 645 F. Supp. 3d 1331, 1339 (S.D. Fla. 2022).  “Both \nprocedural unconscionability and substantive unconscionability must exist before the provision is unenforceable.”  Id . (citing Golden v. Mobil Oil Corp., 882 F.2d 490, 493 (11th Cir. 1989)). \n“Procedural unconscionability focuses on (1) the manner in which the contract was  entered \ninto; (2) whether the complaining party had a meaningful choice at the time the contract was entered into; (3) whether the complaining party had a realistic opportunity to bargain regarding the terms of the contract; and (4) whether he or she had a reasonable opportunity to understand the terms of the contract.”  Valiente , 645 F. Supp. 3d at  1339 (internal quotations omitted).  Substantive \nunconscionability focuses on the “unreasonableness of the terms” in the “agreement itself.”  Basulto v. Hialeah Auto., 141 So. 3d 1145, 1157- 58 (Fla. 2014); Solis v. Am. Express Nat'l Bank , \nNo. 5:23- CV-208- JSM- PRL, 2023 WL 4474322, at *2 (M.D. Fla. July 11, 2023), report and Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 5 of 246 \n recommendation adopted, No. 5:23- CV-208-JSM- PRL, 2023 WL 4831307 (M.D. Fla. July 28, \n2023).  However, while both procedural and substantive unconscionability “must be established \nto avoi d enforcement of the terms within an arbitration agreement[,] . . . . they need not be present \nto the same degree.”  Basulto, 141 So. 3d at 1159 (adopting a “sliding scale” approach for unconscionability). \nHere, Mazile signed the EULA  by checking a box before taking her remote exam s.  In \norder to take her exams, which were required for graduation, she had to agree to the terms provided \nby ExamSoft in the Arbitration Clause , with no effective negotiating power  to change the terms of \nthe software’s use.  [ECF  No. 37 at 7].  Plaintiff, therefore, had little meaningful choice when she \ntook her final examinations to not sign the EULA -- because if she did not agree to the terms as \npresented to her, she would certainly fail to graduate after she had spent over $135,000 in pursuit of her degree.  [Compl. ¶ 12].  Thus, it is clear to this Court that the second and third Valiente  \nfactors of procedural unconscionability are present .   \nHowever, the first and fourth Valiente  factors do not lead to a finding of procedural \nunconscionability.  T he Plaintiff had every opportunity to understand the clear terms of the \nArbitration Clause .  The clause, as Plaintiff admits, was “in the same font, text, color, and size as \nthe rest of the agreement” and was clearly titled “GOVERNING LAW AND ARBITRATION[.]”  [ECF No. 37 at 7].  Plaintiff had a duty to read the contract, which was less than four pages, before she agreed to it, and be cause the Arbitration Clause  was plainly  available for her to read , and not \nhidden in the contract , this Court does not find  that it is procedurally unconscionable.  See Valiente , \n645 F. Supp. 3d at  1340- 41. \nClickwrap agreements are generally valid and enf orceable in Florida , further supporting \nthe Court’s conclusion that the EULA is not procedurally unconscionable even though Plaintiff Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 6 of 247 \n had little choice or bargaining opportunity before  signing it.  See, e.g., Matter of Chaves , No. 22-\n81648- CIV, 2024 WL 718033, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 9, 2024) (finding clickwrap agreements are \ngenerally upheld in Florida) ; Salco Distributors, LLC v. iCode, Inc., No. 8:05 CV 642 T 27TGW, \n2006 WL 449156, at *2 (M.D. Fla. Feb. 22, 2006).  W hile Plaintiff is correct that the EULA was \nlikely one of adhesion, which is a “standardized contract, imposed upon the subscribing party \nwithout an opportunity to negotiate the terms,” Senior Servs. of Palm Beach LLC v. ABCSP Inc. , \nNo. 12- 80226- CIV, 2012 WL 2054971, at *4 (S.D. Fla. June 7, 2012), adhesion contracts are not \n“per se unconscionable[,] ” Joyce v. Forest River, Inc. , No. 23- CV-81262, 2024 WL 517990, at *3 \n(S.D. Fla. Feb. 9, 2024) (holding that an adhesion contract is unconscionable only where more \nfactors are present, such as decepti on). \nThus, despite the presence of two  of the Valiente  factors necessary for procedur al \nunconscionability, the EULA is not strongly procedurally unconscionable .  See Valiente , 645 \nF.Supp.3d at 1339 ( holding that a clickwrap arbitration agreement was enforceable where there \nwas an opt -out clause, Plaintiff had a duty to read the terms and c onditions, and clause was not \nhidden in fine print).  \nWhile substantive unconscionability is a vague standard, because arbitration agreements \nhave been upheld consistently in Florida, and are expressly supported by federal policy, there is \nno evidence that the Arbitration Clause is substantive ly unconscionable .  See Hilton v. Fluent, \nLLC, 297 F. Supp. 3d 1337, 1340 (S.D. Fla. 2018) ; Sims v. Clarendon Nat. Ins. Co., 336 F. Supp. \n2d 1311, 1325 (S.D. Fla. 2004); Laizure v. Avante at Leesburg, Inc., 44 So. 3d 1254, 1257 (Fla. \nDist. Ct. App. 2010), approved, 109 So. 3d 752 (Fla. 2013); see generally AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.S. 333, 339 (2011).  Mazile  states in correct ly that the Arbitration Clause’s \nrequirement  that she waive any class action right  creates substantive unconscionability .  See AT&T Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 7 of 248 \n Mobility , 563 U.S. at 352 (finding that the FAA preempted a state ’s judicial rule  banning class \naction waivers  in arbitration clauses ); Pendergast v. Sprint Nextel Corp., 691 F.3d 1224, 1232 \n(11th Cir. 2012). \nAdditionally, Mazile has offered no explanation (beyond a conclusory statement ) as to why \napplying Texas law would be substantively unconscionable.2  Choice-of- law clauses are only held \nunreasonable and unenforceable when “(1) their formati on was induced by fraud or overreaching; \n(2) the plaintiff would effectively be deprived of its day in court because of the inconvenience and \nunfairness of the chosen forum; (3) the fundamental unfairness of the chosen law would deprive \nthe plaintiff of a remedy; or (4) enforcement of such provisions would contravene a strong public policy.”  Xena Invs., Ltd. v. Magnum Fund Mgmt. Ltd., 726 F.3d 1278, 1284–85 (11th Cir. 2013).  Clearly, the choice -of-law clause here does not meet this test for unreasonableness because (1) \nMazile does not allege fraud in the formation of the EULA ; (2) Mazile would not be deprived of \nher day in Court if Texas law applies as the application of Texas law itself does not forbid the Plaintiff from bringing any claim; (3) Texas law is not fundamentally unfair on unconscionability and closely mirrors Florida law (discussed below) ; and (4) Mazile has identified no strong public \npolicy that would counsel this Court against applying Texas law.  \nBecause Mazile has insuffici ently proven procedural unconscionability, and because there \nis no showing of substantive unconscionability, under Florida law, both clauses would be enforced \nand the Motion to Compel Arbitration would therefore be granted.  However, this Court must also analyze Texas law on unconscionability to determine whether a false conflict exists. \n \n \n2 To show substantive unconscionability under Florida law, Mazile has to show that it \nwould be unreasonable for this Court to apply Texas law  here.  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 8 of 249 \n  Texas Law  \n Similar to Florida, Texas courts analyze contractual unconscionability by determining both \nprocedural and substantive unconscionability.  Bongalis- Royer v. RJ Worldwide, LLC , No. 4:14-\nCV-330, 2015 WL 12778846, at *9 (E.D. Tex. July 16, 2015).  To do this, Texas courts examine \n“(1) the entire atmosphere in which the agreement was made; (2) alternatives, if any, available to \nthe parties at the time of formation; ( 3) the non -bargaining ability of a party; (4) whether the \ncontract was illegal or against public policy; (5) and whether it is oppressive or unreasonable.”  Id.; Delfingen US- Texas, L.P. v. Valenzuela, 407 S.W.3d 791, 798 (Tex. App. 2013).  Additionally, \nand like Florida, clickwrap agreements  are generally valid and enforceable in Texas , regardless of \nthe signatory’s purported lack of choice.   See, e.g., Bongalis- Royer , 2015 WL 12778846 at *9; \nRecursion Software, Inc. v. Interactive Intel., Inc. , 425 F. Supp. 2d 756, 782 (N.D. Tex. 2006); \nStubHub, Inc. v. Ball , 676 S.W.3d 193, 200 (Tex. App. 2023) (“Texas state and federal courts have \nrecognized the validity of clickwrap agreements.”).   \nJust as above, even though the atmosphere in which the agreement was made would suggest \nsome level of  procedural unconscionability, supra, the facts are insufficient to create strong \nprocedural or substantive unconscionability.  Arbitration clauses and choice of law provisions are neither  illegal nor against public policy (in fact, as discussed, federal law supports arbitration \nclauses) and the clickwrap terms were not “unfair or oppressive .”  Johnson v. Sw. Recovery Servs. \nInc., No. 3:22- CV-242-X- BH, 2023 WL 1944127, at *9 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 24, 2023), report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 3:22- CV-0242-X- BH, 2023 WL 1879999 (N.D. Tex. Feb. 10, \n2023) ; supra. \nThus, because both Florida and Texas law would lead to the same conclusion that the \nEULA is not unconscionable , there is a “false conflict” between Texas and Florida law for the Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 9 of 2410 \n enforceability of the Arbitration Clause .  This Court must therefore apply Florida law and , as \ndiscussed above,  finds that the Arbitration Clause is enforceable.  A ny claims that properly fall \nwithin the scope of the Arbitration Clause should be heard in arbitration.  \n2. Scope of the Arbitration Clause  \n The Arbitration Clause in the EULA  provides that any unsettled claim “shall be resolved \nby binding bi -lateral arbitration[.]”  [ECF No. 16 at 36 § 11].  A “claim” is “any claim, demand, \ndispute or controversy of any kind or nature between the parties hereto arising out of or relating to \nthis Agreement, its construction, interpretation, performance or alleged breach.”  [ Id.].  Because \nthis Court found that the choice of law clause in the Arbitration Clause is enforceable, Texas law applies to the determination of whether the Plaintiff’s claims fall under the Arbitration Clause.  \nUnder Texas law, a broad arbitration clause is one “where the language of the clause \nrequires arbitration of any dispute that arises out of or relates to ‘the agreement, or disputes that are in connection with the agr eement.”  Elkjer v. Scheef & Stone, L.L.P., 8 F. Supp. 3d 845, 855 \n(N.D. Tex. 2014).  Where there is a broad arbitration clause, for arbitration to be compelled over certain claims, those claims need only “touch” issues covered by the arbitration clause.  See id .   \nThe Arbitration Clause here is broad because it encompasses  “any claim . . . arising out of \nor relating to this Agreement[.]”   [ECF No. 16 at 36 § 11] .  Thus , any claim that relates to or \n“touches” the Agreement is covered  by the clause and shoul d be heard by an arbitral body, not a \nfederal court .  Here, the three claims against ExamS oft, Count IV (intentional misrepresentation), \nCount V (negligent misrepresentation), and Count VI (breach of warranty of fitness for a particular purpose), all relat e to the agreement which Mazile  signed because they concern her  examinations \nfor which she had to sign the EULA .  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 10 of 2411 \n In Count IV, Mazile states that she “acted on these, and other representations made by \nExamSoft as to the efficacy of its [ExamSoft] Software,  or nondiscriminatory impact thereof, in \nusing the EM Software to take her remediation examinations .”  [ECF No. 1 ¶ 74 (emphasis \nadded)].   In Count V, Mazile states that she “was injured as a direct and proximate result, as she \nwas in fact discriminated upon based on race and/or disability when using the [ExamSoft] \nSoftware[.]” [Id . ¶ 81] .  In Count VI she  states “Plaintiff and ExamSoft were in privity of contr act, \nby virtue of [the EULA.]”  [ Id. ¶ 81].    \nAs Mazile admits , all of these claims clearly  relate to or arise out of the Arbitration Clause.  \n[See ECF No. 36 at 2- 3; Compl. ¶ 8 (“Plaintiff’s claims arise directly out of ExamSoft’s activities \nin the state of Florida . . . the use of [the ExamSoft software] caused Plaintiff to be expelled.” ].  \nThese claims are only actionable because Mazile signed the EULA and decided to take the \nexaminations via ExamSoft.  Therefore, all of these claims should be hear d in arbitration.  The \nMotion to Compel Arbitration as to all counts against ExamSoft  (Counts IV, V, VI ) is GRANTED.  \nIII. The Motion to Dismiss by Larkin  is GRANTED.  \nDefendant Larkin moves to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims against it under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state claims.  [ECF No. 34 at 5].  Specifically, Larkin argues that \n(1) it is not a state actor and therefore not amenable to suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, (2) Plaintiff fails to properly plead discrimination under the ADA bec ause based on the facts presented in the \nAmended Complaint, Larkin could not have known of the possible discriminatory effect of ExamSoft, (3) Plaintiff fails to properly plead failure to accommodate under the ADA because Plaintiff did not demand an accomm odation, and (4) the legislative history of Section 504 of the \nRA implies that Larkin cannot be sued under the Act.  [ Id. at 6 -13].  For the reasons that follow, \nthe Motion is GRANTED. Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 11 of 2412 \n A. Legal Standard  \nTo survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , \n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) (internal \nquotations omitted)).  When reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court must \naccept as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint, and the plaintiffs receive the benefit of all favorable inf erences that can be drawn from the facts alleged.  See  Chaparro v. \nCarnival Corp., 693 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir. 2012); Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. \nA court considering a 12(b)(6) motion is generally limited to the facts contained in the \ncomplaint and attached  exhibits —but may also consider documents referred to in the complaint \nthat are central to the claim and whose authenticity is undisputed.  See  Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, \nInc., 555 F.3d 949, 959 (11th Cir. 2009).  While the court is required to accept as t rue all allegations \ncontained in the complaint, courts “are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as \na factual allegation.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555; Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  “Dismissal pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6) is not appropriate unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.”  Magluta v. Samples , 375 F.3d \n1269, 1273 (11th Cir. 2004) (citation and quotation omitted).  “ [D]etermining whether a complaint  \nstates a plausible claim for relief is a context -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw \non its judicial experience and common sense.”  Holland v. Carnival Corp. , 50 F.4th 1088, 1093 \n(11th Cir. 2022) (alterations accepted) (quoting Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679). \n   Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 12 of 2413 \n B. Discussion  \nCount I – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \n Mazile alleges Larkin  violated Plaintiff’s Equal Protection rights under the Fourteenth \nAmendment and brings a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  [ Compl. ¶ 38].  Count I  fails to state a \nclaim and is plainly futile .  Section  1983, the great civil rights statute  of post -Civil War American \nlaw, was passed “ to deter state actors  from using the badge of their authority to deprive individuals \nof their federally guaranteed rights and to provide relief to victims if such deterrence fails.”  Wyatt \nv. Cole , 504 U.S. 158, 161 (1992)  (emphasis added).  Larkin is a private university, id . ¶ 2, and \nPlaintiff presents no reason that it should be considered a “state actor” subjecting it to suit under § \n1983.   A private party can be considered a state actor in three rare circumstances: “(1) the State \nhas coerced or at least significantly enco uraged the action alleged to violate the Constitution \n(“State compulsion test”); (2) the private parties performed a public function that was traditionally \nthe exclusive prerogative of the State (“public function test”); or (3) the State had so far insinua ted \nitself into a position of interdependence with the private parties that it was a joint participant in the enterprise (“nexus/joint action test”).  Charles v. Johnson, 18 F.4th 686, 694 (11th Cir. 2021) (quoting Rayburn ex rel. Rayburn v. Hogue , 241 F.3d 1341, 1347 (11th Cir. 2001)).  None of these \ncircumstances are present here.  \nMazile argues that  Larkin is a state actor because it (1) performs a primarily and \ntraditionally state function – education, and (2) in the alternative, there is “joint action or a nexus \nbetween the State and Larkin University because Larkin University accepts federal funds.  [ Compl . Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 13 of 2414 \n ¶¶ 34 -35, 37].  These arguments are without merit, and Mazile cites no legal authority  holding a \nprivate university to be a state actor.3 \nCourts have consistently held that private universities are not state actors for purposes of § \n1983.  See Andela v. Univ. of Miami , 461 F. App'x 832, 836 (11th Cir. 2012); Driessen v. Univ. of \nMiami Sch. of L. Child. & Youth L. Clinic , No. 1:20- CV-22559- UU, 2020 WL 13368589, at *2 \n(S.D. Fla. June 23, 2020), aff’d 835 Fed.Appx. 489 (11th Cir. 2020); Driessen v. Univ. of Miami \nSch. of L. Child. & Youth L. Clinic , No. 19-21224-CIV, 2019 WL 8895219, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Sept. \n24, 2019); Althia bat v. Howard Univ., 76 F. Supp. 3d 194, 197 (D.D.C. 2014).  Moreover, the \nreceipt of federal funds “do[es] not elevate [] private educational institutions to the status of ‘state \nactor.’”  Richards v. Duke Univ., 480 F. Supp. 2d 222, 239 (D.D.C. 2007); see Manhattan Cmty. \nAccess Corp. v. Halleck, 587 U.S. 802, 814 (2019); Siyu Yang v. Ardizzone , 540 F. Supp. 3d 372, \n380 (W.D.N.Y. 2021), aff'd sub nom. Yang v. Eastman Sch. of Music , No. 21-1482- CV, 2022 WL \n1040418 (2d Cir. Apr. 7, 2022) (“[A] private entity does not become a state actor for purposes of \n§ 1983 merely on the basis of the private entity's creation, funding, licensing, or regulation by the government.”) (citing Fabrikant v. French, 691 F.3d 193, 207 (2d Cir. 2012)).  Plaintiff is incorrect \nthat Larkin’s receipt of federal funds intertwines it with the government such that it has become a state actor.  \nHaving identified no possible way for Larkin to be considered a state actor, Mazile cannot \nestablish that it is amenable to suit under § 1983.  Count I is DISMISSED with prejudice . \n \n3 The Defendant cites Braden v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 552 F. 2d 948 (3d Cir. 1977) and \nKrynicky v. Univ. of Pittsburgh, 742 F.2d 94 (3d Cir. 1984) for the proposition that courts have \nheld that universities are state actors.  [ See ECF No. 36 at 11].  However, the University of \nPittsburgh is a “state -related” university that received “a massive infusion of moneys” from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Braden, 552 F. 2d at 959.  Larkin  is a private university , and \nthere is no allegation that it received anything close to a “massive infusion of moneys” from the State of Florida.  T hese cases are inapposite.  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 14 of 2415 \n Count II – ADA Discrimination  \nMazile’s next claim against Larkin under the ADA for discrimination is based on her \ndiagnosis of ADHD and anxiety.  Even if taken as true, however, Count II  is so bereft of \ninformation that  it cannot  amount to a discrimination claim under the ADA.  \nUnder the ADA, no employer “shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis \nof disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of \nemployees, emp loyee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment.” 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a); Samson v. Fed. Exp. Corp., 746 F.3d 1196, 1200 (11th Cir. 2014).  “To establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the ADA, a plaintiff \nmust show that [s]he: (1) is disabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of h[er] disability.”  Samson v. Fed. Ex p. Corp., 746 F.3d 1196 (11th Cir. \n2014). \nTaking the Plaintiff’s assertions as true, Plaintiff properly pleads that she is disabled and \nthat Larkin  knew of the discrimination.  [ECF No. 16 ¶¶ 47, 50].  Thus, the first prong of the test \nis met.  \nTo be a “qualified individual” under the ADA, the Plaintiff must show that “she can meet \nthe essential eligibility requirements for participation in the program, either with or without reasonable accommodations.”  Redding v. Nova Se. Univ., Inc., 165 F. Supp. 3d 1274, 1290 (S.D. Fla. 2016); Earl v. Mervyns, Inc. , 207 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2000).  Based on Mazile’s  \nallegations , she is a “qualified individual” because passing the exams was an essential requirement \nof the pharmaceutical program , the use o f ExamSoft impeded  her ability to succeed on the exams , \nand she identifies possible accommodations which could have aided her .  [Compl. ¶ ¶ 32, 63].  Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 15 of 2416 \n However, Mazile’s allegations cannot establish that Larkin discriminated against her \nbecause of  her disabili ty, and thus, her complaint does not properly plead the third prong of ADA \ndiscrimination .  Larkin’s  use of ExamSoft for examinations during COVID -19 was for all  exams, \nregardless of the student.  [ See Compl. ¶ 22].  Plaintiff claims in both her Amended Complaint and \nher response to the Motion to Dismiss that the use of ExamSoft for all exams was discriminatory \nas to her because Larkin “had actual or constructive knowledge that the [ExamSoft software] had a discriminatory effect on individuals who has certa in learning disabilities [which was] gleaned \nfrom a highly publicized open letter from congress[.]”  [ Compl. ¶¶ 52 -53; ECF No. 36 at 15- 16 \n(“Plaintiff further avers that University knew that the [ExamSoft] Software was detrimental, and \nits choice to utiliz e the same amounts to circumstantial evidence that University intended to \ndiscriminate against individuals with ADHD, anxiety, and other disability such as Plaintiff.”) ]. \nThe only possible source of this knowledge that Plaintiff identifies is the letter to ExamSoft \nfrom the United States Senators, which was published in December 2020, seven months after \nPlaintiff took her exams.  [Id., Ex. A at 19- 22].  It is therefore impossible that Larkin would have \nhad knowledge of this letter  at the time Mazile used ExamSoft  for Larkin’s exams .  Mazile tries \nto downplay this fact by claiming that the letter “did not arise in a vacuum ,” and merely \n“solidifie[d] the magnitude  of complaints, studies, and issues in the months prior, including May \nof 2020[.]”  [ECF No. 36 at 16 (emphasis in original)].  While Mazile is entitled to all reasonable \ninferences resolved in her favor, this Court can only take the facts presented to it as true, and Mazile has presented this Court with no possible sources  from which Larkin  could have had \nknowledge of the discriminatory impact of ExamSoft.  See Tropical Soup Corp. v. City of Key W., No. 21- 10459, 2021 WL 3878250, at *1 (11th Cir. Aug. 31, 2021).   Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 16 of 2417 \n Mazile, in her response to this Moti on, wants this Court to accept that it is a “ reasonable \ninference that ExamSoft had received, individually, at least one such complaint prior to May of \n2020” and would like to prove  this allegation through discovery.  [ECF No. 36 at 16 n.6].  \nHowever, “a P laintiff may not amend a complaint via a response to a motion to dismiss. ”  Guerrero \nv. Target Corp., 889 F. Supp. 2d 1348, 1356 n.6 (S.D. Fla. 2012) .  To find, based on her Amended \nComplaint, that there was at least one complaint to ExamSoft about its software would be to read extratextual facts into the record to cure the Amended Complaint’s deficiencies.  This Court will \nnot do so. \nEven assuming the ExamSoft software had a discriminatory effect on Mazile, the Amended \nComplaint alleges no facts that would give rise to even a reasonable inference that Larkin discriminated against Plaintiff because of her disability.  Beyond the Senators’ letter to ExamSoft, \nMazile alleges neit her a separate source of knowledge of ExamSoft’s discriminatory effect nor any \nfacts that would allow this Court to infer that Larkin engaged in purposeful discrimination against \nher.  Mazile’s assertion that Larkin “discriminated against Plaintiff because  of her ADHD and \nanxiety” is merely a legal conclusion unsupported by any facts in the ADA Complaint, and \ntherefore is insufficient for this Court to find that the third prong of the test to state a claim for \nADA discrimination has been met.  [Compl. ¶ 51] . \nThus, the facts that Mazile has  presented, taken as true, cannot amount to a finding that \nLarkin discriminated against Plaintiff because of  her disability .  Count II is  therefore  DISMISSED \nwithout prejudice .  \nCount II I – ADA Failure to Accommodate  \nNext, Mazile alleges  that Larkin “refused to provide reasonable accommodation to \nPlaintiff, with respect to her renumeration exam.”  [Compl. ¶ 59].  Plaintiff, however, fails to Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 17 of 2420 \n because other courts have required a plaintiff to plead the demand , this Court finds that failing to \nplead this essential element of an ADA accommodation claim is grounds for dismissal.4  See \nGaston v. Bellingrath Gardens & Home, Inc., 167 F.3d 1361, 1363 (11th Cir. 1999) (holding that \na plaintiff cannot establish a failu re to accommodation claim without showing he or she demanded \nsuch an accommodation) ; see also D'Onofrio v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 964 F.3d 1014, 1022 \n(11th Cir. 2020).  \nPlaintiff does not allege anywhere that she requested an y accommodation from Larkin, so \nher pleading fails to allege an essential element of ADA failure- to-accommodate claims .  \nTherefore, t his count is DISMISSED without prejudice . \nCount VII – Violation of the Rehabilitation Act  \nFinally, Larkin seeks to dismiss Count VII on grounds that it does not receive federal \nfinancial assistance “as a whole,” because the PPP funds it received were restricted to use for \nparticular purposes.  [ECF No. 24 at 12- 13].  Larkin, however, does not discuss whether the \nPlaintiff’s Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act, despite their argument to dismiss the ADA discrimination claim for failure to state a claim under \nthe exact same standard.   Therefore, this Court will  first analyze whether Larkin is subject to the \nRA based on its receipt of federal PPP funds , and then discuss whether Plaintiff stated a viable \nclaim under the RA.  \n \n4 Plaintiff claims that it must allege only that “reasonable accommodations were available” \nand the defendant “has the burden of persuasion on whether an accommodation would impose an \nundue hardship.”  [ECF No. 36 at 17 (citing Gary v. Ga. Dept. of Human Res., 206 Fed. Appx. 849 (11th Cir. 2006)) ].  Despite the presence of some helpful language for Plaintiff, Gary  does not \nsay that a Plaintiff need only allege that reasonable accommodations “ were available. ”  Rather, \nGary  dealt with an appeal from a district court’s grant of summary judgment and therefore does \nnot discuss  the requirements to adequately plead a claim of ADA failure to accommodate.  Gary , \n206 Fed. Appx. a t 852.  Further, Gary  is necessarily qualified by every other case in the Eleventh \nCircuit which follows it – cases which the Plaintiff conspicuously fails to discuss.\n Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 20 of 2421 \n  Is Larkin a “Program or Activity” that Receives “Federal Financial Assistance?” \n Under the  RA, “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... \nshall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or ac tivity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.”  J.A.M. v. Nova Se. Univ., Inc., 646 F. App'x 921, 926 (11th Cir. 2016) (emphasis omitted ) (citing 29 U.S.C. § 794(a)).  “Program or activity” is defined, in relevant part, \nby the R A as  \n[A]ll of the operatio ns of an entire corporation, partnership, or other private organization, \nor an entire sole proprietorship— \n \n(i) if assistance is extended to such corporation, partnership, private organization, or sole proprietorship as a whole; or \n(ii) which is principally engaged in the business of providing education, health care, housing, social services, or parks and recreation \n  \n29 U.S.C. § 794(a)(3)(A)(i)- (ii).   \nThe parties devote substantial space in their arguments to whether Larkin, by accepting \nPPP fun ds, accepted this Federal financial assistance “as a whole” under § 794(a)(3)(A)(i).\n5  \nDefendant relies heavily on Ariza v. S. Moon Sales, Inc. for the proposition that acceptance of \n \n5 The United States Senate Report of the RA explained the meaning of Federal Financial \nAssistance extended to  an entity “as a whole:”  \n Federal financial assistance extended to a corporation or other entity “as a whole” refers to situations where the corporation receives general assistance that is not designated for a particular purpose. Federal financial assistan ce to the Chrysler Company for the purpose \nof preventing the company from going bankrupt would be an example of assistance to a corporation “as a whole.” Federal aid which is limited in purpose, e.g., Job Training Partnership Act (JPTA) [sic] funds, is not  considered aid to the corporation as a whole, \neven if it is used at several facilities and the corporation has discretion to determine which of its facilities participates in the program. A grant to a religious organization to enable it to extend assistan ce to refugees would not be assistance to the religious organization as a \nwhole if that is only one among a number of activities of the organization.   \n S. REP. 100-64 at *17 (1987).\n Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 21 of 2422 \n federal funds via the Paycheck Protection Program is insufficient to show that a Defendant \nreceived federal financial assistance “as a whole,” as required by 29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(3)(A)(i).  No. 1:21- CV-23604, 2022 WL 4345136, at *4 (S.D. Fla. Sept. 7, 2022), report and recommendation \nadopted, No. 21- 23604- CIV, 2022 WL 4310972 (S .D. Fla. Sept. 19, 2022).  Ariza  depended  on \nthe Senate Report to inform its understanding of the definition of “federal financial assistance extended to such corporation . . . as a whole.”   Similarly, Plaintiff relies on Fernandez v. Bruno \nNorthfleet, Inc . to argue that any doubt which the Court has as to whether PPP funds are “Federal \nfinancial assistance” should be determined based on evidence from discovery.  568 F. Supp. 3d 1294, 1300 (S.D. Fla. 2021) (denying a motion to dismiss a claim under the RA because whether PPP loans are sufficient for purposes of Section 504 is a question better addressed through discovery) . \nThe parties’  arguments and § 794(b)(3)(A)(i), however, are irrelevant to the dispute at \nhand.  Ariza  focused on the phrase “as a whole” in § 794(b)(3)(A)(i) because the Defendant there \nwas a “corporation that owns and operates a retail apparel and accessory store[,] and therefore fell under § 794(b)(3)(A)(i) , not § 794(b)(3)(A)(i i).  2022 WL 4345136, at *4.  Likewise, in Fernandez , \nDefendant was a “corporation that owns and operates retail stores selling bracelets, handbags, shoes, and jewelry [.]” 568 F. Supp. 3d at  1298.  Larkin, however, is a private university that \nprovides Doctoral Pharmaceutical degrees, and thus is not subject to § 794(b)(3)(A)(i ), but rather \nfalls under § 794(b)(3)(A) (ii).  [Compl. ¶ 11].  \n  The parties ignore § 794(b)(3)(A)(i i), which clearly extends the definition of “program \nactivity” to any private organization “w hich is principally engaged in the business of provi ding \neducation [.]”  29 U.S.C. § 794(b)(3)(A)(i i).  Therefore, the limitation under subsection (i) that \nFederal financial assistance must be extended to the organization “as a whole” does not apply to Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 22 of 2423 \n those organizations which are considered “programs or ac tivities” under subsection (ii).  Larkin is \na private university which is in the business of providing education, and thus, whether Larkin uses \nfederal financial assistance “as a whole,” or not has no bearing on whether its receipt of PPP funds subject s it to the RA.  The Senate Report only discusses Federal financial assistance extended “as \na whole” and thus, even if this Court were open to considering legislative history, it would not apply here.   \n Next, this Court must determine whether the PPP loans to Larkin should be considered \n“Federal financial assistance” under § 794(a), based on the ordinary and plain meaning of the term.  PPP loans “provide[d] small businesses with funds to pay up to 8 weeks of payroll costs including benefits” during the COVID -19 crisis and were “fully forgiven when used for payroll costs, interest \non mortgages, rent, and utilities[.]”  Small Business Paycheck Protection Program, U.S. Department of Treasury, available at https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP%20--%20Overview.pdf  (accessed July 2, 2024).  In effect, PPP funds were transfers from the federal \ntreasury to businesses to assist with the severe economic fallout  resulting  from  the COVID- 19 \ncrisis.  Based on an ordinary reading of “Federal financial assistance,” money given from the Federal government to help organizations weather the economic fallout of the pandemic certainly constitutes “Federal financial assistance.”  Therefo re, Larkin is a “program or activity” that \nreceived “Federal financial assistance” and is subject to the R A.   \nHaving determined that  Larkin is subject to the RA, the Plaintiff still must state a claim \nunder the Act to survive this Motion to Dismiss.  \n Does Plaintiff State a Discrimination Claim Under the Rehabilitation Act?  \n The standard to state a discrimination claim under the RA  is the same used for ADA \ndiscrimination: to establish a prima facie case, “the plaintiff must demonstrate that [s]he (1) is Case 1:23-cv-23306-DSL   Document 53   Entered on FLSD Docket 07/22/2024   Page 23 of 2424 \n \ndisabled, (2) is a qualified individual, and (3) was subjected to unlawful discrimination because of \n[her] disability.”  J.A.M., 646 F. App’x at 926; Doe v. Univ. of Miami , 446 F. Supp. 3d 1000, 1010 \n(S.D. Fla. 2020) .  \nBecause the standard for claims brought  under ADA discrimination and RA  discrimination \nare identical , this Court relies on its analysis in for Count II  and determines that Mazile has pleaded \ninsufficient facts to show that Larkin discriminated against her because of  her disabilities, even \nwhen taking all facts in the Amended Complaint as true.  Therefore, Count VII is  DISMISSED  \nwithout prejudice . \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED Defendants’ Motion to \nCompel Arbitration or, in the Alternative, Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint [ ECF No. 34] \nis GRANTED.    \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Counts IV, V, and VI against Defendant ExamSoft \nmust be heard in binding arbitration.  Arbitration of these three counts is compelled.    \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Count I is D ISMISSED with prejudice, and Counts II, \nIII, and VII are DISMISSED without prejudice.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court conditionally granted Equifax's motion to dismiss Elijah Whaley's complaint for failing to provide a concise and understandable statement of claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Although Whaley previously used AI to draft legal documents in a related case, there is no indication that AI was used in this filing. The court emphasized the prohibition of AI-generated documents and granted Whaley the opportunity to amend his complaint within 30 days.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's verbose and confusing complaint satisfies the requirement under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) to provide a \"short and plain statement\" of the claim.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court conditionally granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, finding the plaintiff's complaint violated Rule 8(a). The court provided Whaley 30 days to file a concise amended complaint detailing the alleged FCRA violations, specifying the inaccurate information, and identifying to whom and when it was transmitted.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: The court told Elijah that his complaint was too confusing and long, making it hard for Equifax to understand and respond. The judge gave Elijah a chance to rewrite his complaint, explaining clearly and simply what Equifax did wrong under credit reporting laws, but warned him not to use AI to help do this.",

It is before the Court on \nDefendant’s  Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)  motion to dismiss .  Doc. No. 14.  Plaintiff filed an opposition \nmemorandum  (Doc. No. 21), and Defendant filed a reply  (Doc. No. 23).2  This m otion is now ripe \n \n1 The Court accepts a pro se  plaintiff’s allegations as true and “construe[s] filings by pro se  litigants \nliberally.”  Owens v. Keeling , 461 F.3d 763, 776 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Spotts v. United States , 429 F.3d \n248, 250 (6th Cir. 2005)).  However, while pro  se pleadings are “liberally construed” and “held to less \nstringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,” Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) \n(per curiam), pro se  plaintiffs must still satisfy basic pleading requirements.  See Hill v.  Lappin, 630 F.3d \n468, 470–71 (6th Cir. 2010).  \n2 In a related case, Plaintiff admitted t hat he used  Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to prepare  case filings.  See \nDoc. No. 25 at PageID 536 –37, Whaley v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., No. 3:22- cv-356 (S.D. Ohio May 23, \n2023).  Although there is no reason to believe Plaintiff has us ed AI to prepare his filings  in the present case, \nthe Court reminds all parties that they are not allowed to use A I—for any purpose —to prepare any filings \nin the instant case or any case before the undersigned.  See Judge  Newman ’s Civil Standing Order at VI .  \nBoth parties, and their respective counsel, have an obligation to immediately inform the Court if they \ndiscover that a party has used AI to prepare any filing.

See Doc. No. 6.  Counting attachments —consisting \nof various letters sent to Defendant in which Plaintiff complain s about  allegedly unlawful \nconduct —it is 150  pages.  See Doc. No. 6- 1.  Adding his various motions requesting, inter al ia, a \ndefault judgment, summary judgment , and Rule 11 sanctions, Plaintiff’s pleadings, motions, and \nattachments total 207 pages.  Doc. Nos. 6, 17, 18, 23, 24, 25.  Although unclear, Plaintiff , in his \ncomplaint and various motions, alleges that Defendant vio lated the FCRA , at times and dates not \napparent on the face of his various filings .  See generally Doc. No. 6.  Recognizing this issue, \nDefendant seeks  dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint because it is  too verbose  and confusing to \nprovide adequate notice of t he allegedly  unlawful conduct for which Plaintiff seeks relief .  Doc. \nNo. 14 at PageID 346–47.  \nII. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) requires that “‘[a]  pleading that states a claim for relief . . . contain,’  \namong other things, ‘ a short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled \nto relief. ’”  Kensu v. Corizon, Inc., 5 F.4th 646, 649 (6th Cir. 2021) (emphasis added) (quoting \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  A complaint violates Fed. R. Civ.

The usual remedy is dismissal without prejudice, \nwhile granting leave to amend.

Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 901 F.3d 619, \n629–30 (6th Cir. 2018)  (citing Boggio v. USAA Fed. Sav. Bank , 696 F.3d 611, 617- 18 (6th Cir. \n2012) ; see also Thompson v. Equifax Info.

Equifax Info. Sols., Inc., 204 F. Supp. 3d 956, 960 (E.D. \nMich. 2016) )).  His 150-page complaint only alleg es that Defendant violated the FCRA, without \nindicating what inaccurate information, if any, Defendant relayed to others , so the complaint  is \nunclear  and potentially frivolous or malicious.  See generally Doc.  No. 6.  Plaintiff’s complaint, \nand his various motions, consist of mostly irrelevant background information, interspersed quotes, \nand miscellaneous legal citations  that do not offer Defendant a fair glimpse at what actions  could \nplausibly give rise to an FCRA claim.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves a motion to dismiss filed by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association (TTRA) against claims made by their former employee, Rikkie Gonzalez, for discrimination and defamation among others. The court dismissed Gonzalez's claims because she failed to adequately allege that TTRA met the employee threshold required under Title VII and TCHRA to qualify as an employer. The case is notable for the involvement of artificial intelligence (AI) as the plaintiff's counsel was sanctioned for submitting a response brief generated by AI that contained inaccuracies, including fictional legal references.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff sufficiently alleged that the defendant had enough employees to qualify as an \"employer\" under Title VII and TCHRA, and whether the federal court should exercise supplemental jurisdiction over remaining state law claims.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted TTRA's motion to dismiss, holding that Gonzalez failed to establish that TTRA had the requisite number of employees to be considered an employer under the relevant statutes. Consequently, her federal claims were dismissed with prejudice and her state law claims were dismissed without prejudice as the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Rikkie Gonzalez sued her old boss, TTRA, claiming they discriminated against and defamed her. The court decided that for such a lawsuit to proceed under federal law, the company needs to have at least 15 employees, which Gonzalez couldn't prove. Also, Gonzalez's lawyer got into trouble for using a computer program to write legal papers that contained made-up court cases, which is a big no-no. So, the federal part of the lawsuit was thrown out, and the court decided not to deal with the remaining state claims for now.",
    "full_text": "1 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS \nAUSTIN  DIVISION  \n \nRIKKIE GONZALEZ,  § \n § \n Plaintiff,  § \n  § \nv. §   1:24-CV- 880-RP \n § \nTEXAS TAXPAYERS AND RESEARCH  § ASSOCIATION , § \n § \n Defendant.  § \n  \nORDER  \nBefore the Court is Defendant Texas Taxpayers and Research Association’s (“TTRA” ) \nmotion to dismiss, (Dkt. 5). There is no responsive briefing from Plaintiff Rikki Gonzalez \n(“Plaintiff”) before the Court.1 The motion to dismiss is therefore unopposed.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff filed suit against TTRA, her former employer, for discrimination, retaliation, and a \nhostile work environment on the basis of race and national origin under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (“Title VII”) and Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code (“TCHRA”). She has also brought claims against TTRA for defamation, defamation per se, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress under Texas common law.  \nIn its motion to dismiss, TTRA argues (1) Plaintiff’s claims under Title VII and TCHRA \nmust be dismissed because Plaintiff has failed to plead TTRA has the requisite number of employees under those statutes; (2) h er claims for infliction of emotional distress must be dismissed because \nthose claims  are preempted by Title VII and TCHRA, and negligent infliction of emotional distress \n \n1 Plaintiff’s responsive briefing was stricken and not considered by the Court for the purposes of deciding the \nmotion to dismiss because the Court determined that Plaintiff’s counsel used AI (artificial intelligence) to \ncraft his response to the motion to dismiss , the resulting brief was riddled with fake cases and other errors , \nand Plaintiff’s counsel was not forthright with the Court about his use of AI . See Order, (Dkt. 29 ).  Case 1:24-cv-00880-RP     Document 32     Filed 01/30/25     Page 1 of 52 is not a recognized cause of action under state or federal law ; and (3) her defamation claim must be \ndismissed because statements about the reason for Plaintiff’s termination made by TTRA’s president \nto the Texas Workforce Commission or to other TTRA employees in internal communications are protected by the qualified privilege , and Plaintiff’s vague and unspecified assertion that an allegation \nof theft was made to “third parties” including an unidentified group of “colleagues” does not meet the pleading standards and, even if it did, such internal communications are not actionable under Texas law.  (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 5).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nPursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), a court may dismiss a complaint for “failure to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). In deciding a 12(b)(6) motion, a “court accepts ‘all well -pleaded facts as true, viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. ’” In re Katrina \nCanal Breaches Litig. , 495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir. 2007)  (quoting  Mart in K. Eby Constr. Co. v. Dall. Area \nRapid Transit , 369 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir. 2004) ). “To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a \ncomplaint ‘does not need detailed factual allegations,’ but must provide the plaintiff’s  grounds for \nentitlement to relief —including factual allegations that when assumed to be true ‘raise a right to \nrelief above the speculative level.’” Cuvillier v. Taylor , 503 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). That is, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual \nmatter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 570).  \nA claim has facial plausibility “ when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court \nto draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged .” Id. “The \ntenet that a court must accept as true all of  the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to \nlegal conclusions. Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice. ” Id. A court ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion may rely on the Case 1:24-cv-00880-RP     Document 32     Filed 01/30/25     Page 2 of 53 complaint, its proper attachments, “documents incorporated into the complaint by reference, and \nmatters of which a court may take judicial notice.”  Dorsey v. Portfolio Equities, Inc., 540 F.3d 333, 338 \n(5th Cir.  2008)  (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). A court may also consider \ndocuments that a defendant attaches to a motion to dismiss “ if they are referred to in the plaintiff ’s \ncomplaint and are central to her claim.” Causey v. Sewell Cadillac-Chevrolet, Inc. , 394 F.3d 285, 288 (5th \nCir. 2004) . But b ecause the court reviews only the well -pleaded facts in the complaint, it may not \nconsider new factual allegations made outside the complaint . Dorsey,  540 F.3d at  338. “[A] motion to \ndismiss under 12(b)(6) ‘is viewed with disfavor and is rarely granted.’” Turner v. Pleasant , 663 F.3d \n770, 775 (5th Cir. 2011) (quoting Harrington v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. , 563 F.3d 141, 147 (5th Cir. \n2009)).  \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nHaving reviewed the motion to dismiss and the relevant law, the Court finds that Plaintiff \nhas failed to state an employment discrimination claim under Rule 12(b)(6). To be held liable under Title VII, TTRA must be an employer. 42 U.S.C.A. § 2000e -2. An employer must have “fifteen or \nmore employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year .” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(b). Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code contains the \nsame employer -size provision that is found in Title VII. See  Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 21.002(8); see also \nTaylor v. E. Tex. Border Health Clinic , 2010 WL 55995 (E.D. Tex. Jan. 5, 2010) (TCHRA provisions are \nconstrued consistent with federal precedent).   \nPlaintiff failed to plead TTRA is an employer under Title VII or Texas law. Plaintiff alleges \nTTRA has “a board of directors made up of 63 individuals, an executive committee composed of 23 professionals, an office staff team of 8, and more than 215 total members.”  (Complaint, Dkt. 1 -1, at \n5). At most, Plaintiff has alleged that TTRA has 8 employees since Plaintiff has not alleged that \nTTRA board of directors or committee members —through, for example , their performance of Case 1:24-cv-00880-RP     Document 32     Filed 01/30/25     Page 3 of 54 duties —are employees of TTRA under Title VII. Similarly, Plaintiff fails to plead facts supporting a \ndetermination that TTRA’s paying members are employees. Because Plaintiff has not adequately \nalleged that TTRA employs 15 or more people as employees, as defined by Title VII, Plaintiff’s claims under Title VII and TCHRA must be dismissed.  \nHaving dismissed Plaintiff’s federal claim, the only remaining claims would be Plaintiff’s \nstate law claims for emotional distress and defamation. The Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over those claims. Generally “a court should decline to exercise [supplemental] jurisdiction over the remaining state -law claims when all federal -law claims are eliminated before \ntrial.”  Brookshire Bros. Holding, Inc. v. Dayco Prods., Inc., 554 F.3d 595, 602 (5th Cir. 2009). Section 1367 \nauthorizes a court to decline supplemental jurisdiction over a state law claim if: (1) the claim raises a novel or complex issue of state law; (2) the claim substantially predominates over the claim or claims over which the district court has original jurisdiction; (3) the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction; or (4) in exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c). Plaintiff’s state law claims are not novel or complex; this was substantially a Title VII case, not a tort case; and the Court is dismissing the federal claim over which it had original jurisdiction. In the absence of any basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction, this Court declines to try Plaintiff’s state law claims for emotional distress and defamation .  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED that  TTRA’s Motion to Dismiss, (Dkt. 5 ), is GRANTED .  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff’s Title VII and TCHRA claims are \nDISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE . IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff’s state law \nclaims are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Michael Anthony Allen v. Facebook et al., the plaintiff, incarcerated at the El Dorado Correctional Facility, brought a pro se civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Allen alleged that various social media companies used artificial intelligence (AI) and technology to induce psychological harm, suggesting a conspiracy involving \"illegal A.I.\" emissions that caused him mental distress and suicidal thoughts. The court dismissed the case as frivolous since the plaintiff failed to name any state actor, which is a requirement under § 1983, and because the claims lacked merit.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's allegations against social media companies constitute a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, requiring the involvement of a state actor.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the case must be dismissed as the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the defendants were state actors as required for a § 1983 claim, and the claims were deemed frivolous as they lacked any arguable legal or factual basis.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you believe that certain social media sites are using secret technology to control your thoughts and you decide to sue them because you think they are violating your rights. However, to successfully sue under a specific law (like § 1983), you need to prove the company is acting like the government. The court said, \"Social media companies aren't like the government, so this law doesn’t apply to them.\" Plus, your claims didn't have any solid facts or law to back them up, so the case was thrown out.",

CASE NO. 24-3057-JWL  \nFACEBOOK.,  et al.,    Defendants.    \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \n \n Plaintiff brings this pro se civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiff is \nincarcerated at the El Dorado Co rrectional Facility in El Dora do, Kansas.  On April 25, 2024, the \nCourt entered a Memorandum and Order to Show Ca use (Doc. 5) (“MOSC”), ordering Plaintiff to \nshow good cause why his Complaint s hould not be dismissed for the re asons set forth in the MOSC.  \nThis matter is before the Court on Plaintiff’s response (Doc. 8). \n The Court found in the MOSC th at Plaintiff’s Complaint is largely incomprehensible and \nappears to bring claims against va rious social media companies.  Plaintiff seems to allege that he \nwas exposed to “illegal A.I.” emissions when he st arted hearing voices in 2 019.  (Doc. 1, at 2.)  He \nsuggests that social media plat forms used “human induced psyc hosis in 2021 that cause thought \nof suicide in 2021.”  Id.  Plaintiff claims that “emitter tec hnology can be linked to human frequency \nthat cause human induced psychos is a wifi technology little blac k box technology ultra sound beam \nair technology that has side effect of thought of suicide self harm if  not suicide the illegal A.I. can \nlead to human death.”  Id. at 4.  Plaintiff alleges that this has led to stalking and bullying through \nthe company wifi and frequency ta rgeting with illegal A.I.  Id. at 5. \n Plaintiff names as defendants:  Facebook; Me ta; Instagram; Twitter; Mark Zuckerberg; and \nMichael Zuckerberg.  For relief, Plaintiff seeks:  compensation; an apology;  to have the FBI stop Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 11   Filed 05/15/24   Page 1 of 42 \n social media from using illegal artificial intelligence;  to be taken out of the Kansas Department of \nCorrections’ “wifi and frequency and so cial media wifi and frequency.”  Id. at 6.   \n “To state a claim under § 1983, a pl aintiff must allege the viol ation of a right secured by \nthe Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was \ncommitted by a person acting under color of state law.”  West v. Atkins , 487 U.S. 42, 48 (1988) \n(citations omitted).  A defendant acts “under colo r of state law” when he “exercise[s] power \n‘possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with \nthe authority of state law.’”  Id. at 49 (citations omitted).   \n The Court found in the MOSC that Plaintiff fails to plausibly claim that any of the \nDefendants are state actors.  See Bethune v. Facebook Inc. , 2021 WL 5182246, at *2 (D. Minn. \nOct. 15, 2021) (“Neither Facebook nor Zuckerberg is al leged, or can plausibly be alleged, to be a \n‘state actor’ within the meaning of § 1983.”) (citing see Prager Univ. v. Google LLC , 951 F.3d \n991, 997 n.3 (9th Cir. 2020) (collecting cases for pr oposition that private social-media companies \nsuch as and including Facebook are not st ate actors for purposes of § 1983).  \n The Court found that not only has Plaintiff failed to name a stat e actor, but his claims also \nappear to be frivolous.  “A  complaint . . . is frivolous when it ‘lacks an arguable basis either in law \nor in fact.’”  Manco v. Does , 363 F. App’x 572, 575 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing Neitzke v. Williams , \n490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989)).    The Court ordered Plaintiff to show good cau se why his Complaint s hould not be dismissed \nas frivolous and for failure to name  a state actor.  In his response, Plaintiff continues to argue that \nthe defendant social media compan ies are using “sound beaming” to harass Plaintiff.  (Doc. 8, at \n1.)  Plaintiff argues that the companies conduct a public service to the community.  Id.  Plaintiff \nalso alleges that his mail to the FBI and news outlets was tampered with, because “social media Case 5:24-cv-03057-JWL   Document 11   Filed 05/15/24   Page 2 of 43 \n did not want the FBI to know” about the sound bea ming being used as a spying device and social \nmedia is “infringing on a ll USPS Postal Routes.”  Id. at 11, 18.   \n Plaintiff has failed to sh ow good cause why his Complaint should not be dismissed as \nfrivolous and for failure to name a sate actor.  “Federal courts have uniformly rejected attempts to treat  . . .  social media companie s as state actors under Section 1983.”  Rutenburg v.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Jermar Fluckers v. Fox News Contractors and others, the plaintiff, Jermar Fluckers, applied to proceed in forma pauperis, which the court granted based on his indigent status. However, the Magistrate Judge recommended the dismissal of his claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e) because the complaint failed to allege any actionable harm by the defendants and was deemed frivolous.

Dkt. 2. Because Fluckers  is requesting permission to proceed in forma \npauperis,  the undersigned must review and make a recommendation on the merits of \nhis claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e).  \nI. REQUEST TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS  \nThe Court has reviewed Fluckers’s  financial affidavit and determined he is \nindigent and should be granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. Accordingly, the Case 1:24-cv-00998-RP     Document 6     Filed 01/14/25     Page 1 of 52 \n Court hereby GRANTS  Fluckers’s  request for in forma pauperis status, Dkt . 2. The \nClerk of the Court shall file the complaint without payment of fees or costs or giving \nsecurity therefor pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a). This indigent status is granted \nsubject to a later determination that the action should be dismissed if the alleg ation \nof poverty is untrue or the action is found frivolous or malicious pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). Fluckers  is further advised that, although he has been granted leave to \nproceed in forma pauperis, a court may, in its discretion, impose costs of court at the \nconclusion of this lawsuit, as in other cases. Moore v. McDonald , 30 F.3d 616, 621 \n(5th Cir. 1994).  \nAs stated below, the undersigned has made a § 1915(e) review of the claims \nmade in this complaint and recommends that Fluckers’s  claims be dismissed under \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). Therefore, service upon Defendants  should be withheld pending \nthe District Court’s review of the recommendations made in this report. If the District \nCourt declines to adopt the recommendations, then service should be issued at that \ntime upon  Defendants.  \nII. REVIEW OF THE MERITS OF THE CLAIM  \nBecause  Fluckers  has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, the \nundersigned is required by statute to review his c omplaint. Section 1915(e)(2) \nprovides in relevant part that “the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court \ndetermines that … the action or appeal (i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state \na claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). A complaint is Case 1:24-cv-00998-RP     Document 6     Filed 01/14/25     Page 2 of 53 \n frivolous if it “lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.” Neitzke v. Williams , \n490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989); Siglar v. Hightower , 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997). A \nclaim lacks an arguable basis in law when it is “based on an indisputably meritless \nlegal theory.” Neitzke , 490 U.S. at 327.  \nPro se complaints are liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff. Haines v. \nKerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520- 21 (1972). However, pro se status does not offer a plaintiff \nan “impenetrable shield, for one acting pro se has no license to harass others, clog the \njudicial machinery with meritless litigation, and abuse already overloaded court \ndocke ts.” Farguson v. MBank Houston N.A. , 808 F.2d 358, 359 (5th Cir. 1986).  \nIn his complaint, Fluckers alleges that “AI ” (presumably, artificial intelligence) \nand “persons locally” found him in a hotel and “collected information [on his] \nanatomy .” Dkt. 1, at 2. He further states that these actors, as well as his ex -wife and \nher associates, “fir[ed] off” his “anatomy,” though it is unclear from the complaint  \nwhat Fluckers means by “fir[ed] off.”  Id. Fluckers adds that he  was subjected to “hard \ncalls,” which he defines as “when I have an erection phones ring [n]oticing to my [ ex-\n]wife and other[s].” Id.  at 5.  \nWhile Fluckers  lists as his cause of action “ [h]arassment of a sexual matter ,” \nhe fails to allege that any of the Defendants in this suit took any action against him.  \nId. at 3.1 Indeed, Fluckers does not mention Defendants Fox News Contractors, BET \nContractors , Regean E. LNU (Last Name Unknown), Rudy LNU, or Deandre \n \n1 Fluckers also states that his cause of action is based on “[h]arassment of a sexual matter of \n… a minor of mine.” Dkt. 1, at 3. However, he similarly fails to allege that any Defendant \ncaused harm to the minor.  Case 1:24-cv-00998-RP     Document 6     Filed 01/14/25     Page 3 of 54 \n Fluckers in his complaint. Id.  While Fluckers lists Defendant Wendi Ann Ortega in \nhis complaint, he makes no allegations against her. Id.  at 4. Finally, Fluckers fails to \nidentify by name any of the actors whom he alleges caused him harm, including the \n“persons locally,” his ex -wife, or any of her “associates.” See id. at 2.  \nBecause Fluckers fails to allege that any Defendant caused him harm or took \nany action against him, he fails to state a claim against any Defendant. Accordingly, \nthe undersigned recommends that Fluckers’s claims against all Defendants be \ndismissed. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2).  \nIII. ORDER AND RECOMMENDATION  \nThe undersigned hereby GRANTS  Fluckers’s  application to p roceed in forma \npauperis. Dkt. 2. The undersigned RECOMMENDS  that t he District Judge  \nDISMISS  Fluckers’s  cause of action wit h prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915(e)(2)(B). If the District Judge adopts the recommendation, the outstanding \nmotions in Fluckers’s case would be  MOOT . Dkts. 4; 5.  \nThe referral of this case to the Magistrate Judge should now be canceled.  \nIV. WARNINGS  \nThe parties may file objections to this r eport and r ecommendation. A party \nfiling objections must specifically identify those findings or recommendations to \nwhich objections are being made. The District Judge  need not consider frivolous, \nconclusive, or general objections. See Battle v. United States Parole Comm’n , 834 F.2d \n419, 421 (5th Cir. 1987). A party’s failure to file written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations contained in this r eport within fourteen days after the Case 1:24-cv-00998-RP     Document 6     Filed 01/14/25     Page 4 of 55 \n \nparty is served with a copy of the r eport shall bar that party from de novo  review by \nthe District Judge  of the proposed findings and recommendations in the r eport and, \nexcept upon grounds of plain error, shall bar the party from appellate review of \nunobjected -to proposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the District \nJudge .

The court’s record shows that \na summons based on the first amended complaint was issued and served on plaintiff by mail on \nDecember 28, 2016.  (ECF No. 5.)  There have been no subsequent filings in the case.  \n In the first amended complaint, plaintiff names as defendants the United States of \nAmerica, the United States Department of Health  and Human Services, th e National Institute of \nHealth, the National Science Foundation, the Federal Communications Commission, and the \nNational Human Genome Research Institute, al ong with Doe defendants.  (ECF No. 4.)  \nAccording to plaintiff, various federal actors  (including employees and grant awardees) have \nillegally consented to the use of plaintiff’s pe rson and body for medical re search and behavioral Case 2:16-cv-02902-TLN-KJN   Document 7   Filed 04/21/17   Page 1 of 41 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  \n  2\n \n science experiments, labeling plaintiff as a “U.S . government experimental subject.”  (Id.)  The \ncomplaint is replete with allega tions of artificial intelligence , electronic mon itoring, biological \ntrade secrets, social engineering, and physical/psychological torture.  (Id.) \n No proof of service was file d in the record, and no defenda nt has yet appeared in the \naction.  As such, it seems quite likely that plainti ff never properly served defendants with process.  \nAdditionally, plaintiff failed to file  a status report prior to the stat us conference as ordered.  (ECF \nNo. 3.)  However, plaintiff appeared at the status conference and re sponded to the court’s \nquestioning.  If the only defects in plaintiff’s case had been  his failure to comple te service of process \nand failure to file a status report prior to the stat us conference, the court w ould have been strongly \ninclined, in light of plaintiff’s pro se status, to provide plaintiff with  an opportunity to cure such \ndefects.  Nevertheless, after car efully reviewing the allegations of plaintiff’s first amended \ncomplaint, the court concludes that it lacks su bject matter jurisdiction over the action under the \nsubstantiality doctrine.     A federal court has an independent duty to assess whether federal subject matter \njurisdiction exists, whether or not the parties raise the issue.  See United Investors Life Ins. Co. v. \nWaddell & Reed Inc., 360 F.3d 960, 967 (9th Cir. 2004) (stating that “the dist rict court had a duty \nto establish subject matter juri sdiction over th e removed action sua sponte , whether the parties \nraised the issue or not”); accord Rains v. Crite rion Sys., Inc., 80 F.3d 339, 342 (9th Cir. 1996).  \nThe court must sua sponte  dismiss the case if, at any time, it determines that it lacks subject \nmatter jurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).      \n“Under the substantiality doctrine, the district  court lacks subject matter jurisdiction when \nthe question presented is too ins ubstantial to consider.”  Cook  v. Peter Kiewit Sons Co., 775 F.2d \n1030, 1035 (9th Cir. 1985) (citing Hagans v. La vine, 415 U.S. 528, 536-39 (1974)).  “The claim \nmust be ‘so insubstantial, implausible, foreclos ed by prior decisions of this Court or otherwise \ncompletely devoid of merit as not to involve a fe deral controversy within the juri sdiction of the \nDistrict Court, whatever may be the ultimate reso lution of the federal issues on the merits.’”  Id. \n(quoting Oneida Indian Nation v. County of Oneida, 414 U.S. 661, 666 (1974)); see also Apple v. Case 2:16-cv-02902-TLN-KJN   Document 7   Filed 04/21/17   Page 2 of 41 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  \n  3\n \n Glenn, 183 F.3d 477, 479 (6th Cir. 1999) ( “a district court may, at any time, sua sponte  dismiss a \ncomplaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pu rsuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure when the allega tions of a complaint are totally implausible, attenuated, \nunsubstantial, frivolous, devoid of meri t, or no longer open to discussion.”). \nThe court finds that the allegations of plai ntiff’s first amended complaint, as outlined \nabove, are implausible, devoid of merit, and unsubstant ial.  At the hearing, the court, especially in \nlight of plaintiff’s pro se status, questioned plaintiff regardi ng the nature of his claims and \nprovided plaintiff with a further opportunity to be tter articulate them.  However, plaintiff simply \nmade additional implausible allegations regarding being a computer scien ce experimental subject \nand the focus of a large conspiracy involving a ttorneys, pharmaceutical companies, and faculty \nfrom various academic institutions in Humboldt C ounty.  Therefore, the court concludes that this \naction should be dismissed for lack of subject ma tter jurisdiction pursuant to the substantiality \ndoctrine.1 \nAccordingly, IT IS HEREBY RECOMMENDED that: 1. The action be dismissed for lack of s ubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the \nsubstantiality doctrine. \n2. The Clerk of Court be dir ected to close this case. \nThese findings and recommendations are submitt ed to the United States District Judge \nassigned to the case, pursuant to  the provisions of 28 U.S.C. § 636( b)(l).  Within fourteen (14) \ndays after being served with these findings and recommendations, any party may file written \nobjections with the court and se rve a copy on all parties.  Such  a document should be captioned \n“Objections to Magistrate Judge ’s Findings and Recommendations.”   Any reply to the objections \nshall be served on all parties and filed with the cour t within fourteen (14) da ys after service of the \nobjections.  The parties are advise d that failure to file objections  within the specified time may \nwaive the right to appeal the District Court’ s order.  Turner v. Duncan, 158 F.3d 449, 455 (9th \n                                                 \n1 The court emphasizes that the foregoing obser vations are not intended insult or disparage \nplaintiff.  The court has no doubt  that plaintiff truly believes th at he experiences the alleged \nactions or phenomena.  However, the court concl udes that plaintiff’s allegations do not plausibly \ninvoke this court’s subject matter jurisdiction.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves the plaintiff, Darion Dion Frederick, who filed a complaint seeking a nonillion dollars in damages and an \"alien\" against the defendant \"And Company.\" The United States Magistrate Judge recommends dismissing the lawsuit as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2), as it lacks a cognizable legal claim or factual basis. There is no explicit involvement of AI, machine learning, or automated systems in the facts, claims, or holding of the case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's complaint presents a viable legal claim that falls within the jurisdiction of the federal court.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court grants the plaintiff's application to proceed in forma pauperis (without paying filing fees due to indigence) but recommends dismissing the complaint with prejudice as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) because it lacks a substantive legal or factual basis.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone wanted to sue asking for an impossible amount of money and an alien, but didn’t explain a good reason for the lawsuit. The court looked at the case and said it was really just nonsense, so they decided it shouldn't go forward.",

In Forma Pauperis  Status  \nAfter reviewing Plaintiff’s Application , the Court finds that he is indigent. Accordingly, the \nCourt HEREBY GRANTS  Plaintiff in forma pauperis  status. This indigent status is granted \nsubject to a later determination that the action should be dismissed if the allegation of poverty is \nuntrue or the action is found frivolous or malicious pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). Plaintiff is \n \n1 Plaintiff has filed a Motion for In Forma Pauperis  in another case pending before the Honorable Dustin \nM. Howell. See Frederick v. Artificial Intelligence Fields, 1:23- cv-01149- DII-DH (W.D. Tex. Sept. 25, \n2023). Case 1:23-cv-01497-RP   Document 5   Filed 01/10/24   Page 1 of 42 \n further advised that although he has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis , a Court may, \nin its discretion, impose costs of court at the conclusion of this lawsuit, as in other cases. Moore v. \nMcDonald, 30 F.3d 616, 621 (5th Cir. 1994). \nAs stated below, the  Court has conducted a § 1915(e) review of the claims made in the \nComplaint and recommends  that Plaintiff’s claims should be dismissed under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). \nTherefore, service on the Defendant should be withheld pending the District Court’s review of the recommendations made in this report. If the District Court declines to adopt the recom mendations, \nservice should be issued on the Defendant  at that time . \nII. Section 1 915(e)(2) F rivolousness Review  \nA. Standard of Review  \nBecause Plaintiff has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis , the Court is required \nby standing order to review his Complaint under § 1915(e)(2) . A district court may summarily \ndismiss a complaint filed in forma pauperis  if it concludes that the action is (1) frivolous or \nmalicious; (2) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (3) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B).  \nUnder this statute, a claim is frivolous when it lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact. \nNeitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 324- 25 (1989); Talib v. Gilley , 138 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir. \n1998). “A complaint lacks an arguable basis in law if it is based on an indisputably meritless legal \ntheory, such as if the complaint alleges the violation of a legal interest which clearly does not exist.” Harper v. Showers , 174 F.3d 716, 718 (5th Cir. 1999) (quoting Davis v. Scott , 157 F.3d \n882, 889 (5th Cir. 1998)). It lacks an arguable factual basis only if the facts alleged are “clearly baseless,” a category encompassing “ fanciful, ” “fantastic, ” and “delusional ” allegations. Denton \nv. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 32- 33 (1992) (citing Neitzke, 490 U.S. at 327- 28). “Some claims are Case 1:23-cv-01497-RP   Document 5   Filed 01/10/24   Page 2 of 43 \n so insubstantial, implausible, or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal \ncontroversy. Federal courts lack power to entertain these wholly insubstantial and frivolous claims.” Atakapa Indian de Creole Nation v. Louisiana, 943 F.3d 1004, 1006 (5th Cir. 2019) \n(cleaned up).  \nB. Plaintiff’s Complaint Should Be Dismissed under § 1915(e)(2)  \nPlaintiff invokes this Court’s federal question jurisdiction but alleges no intelligible claims \nagainst Defendant “And Company.”  Plaintiff states that his claim is: “How to make an Alien .” \nDkt. 1 at 4. He seeks nonillion dollars in monetary damages and an “[a]lien.” Id .  \nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. v. Jackson, 139 S. Ct. \n1743, 1746 (2019). Federal subject matter jurisdiction extends to civil cases “arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,” or over civil cases in which diversity of citizenship exists between the parties. 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1332. As the party asserting federal \njurisdiction, Plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that jurisdiction is proper. Sureshot Golf \nVentures, Inc. v. Topgolf Int’ l., Inc., 754 F. App’ x 235, 239 (5th Cir. 2018) . Plaintiff has failed to \nallege a cognizable claim that this Court would have jurisdiction to adjudicate.  \nIn addition, Plaintiff’s claims are “so insubstantial, implausible, or otherwise completely \ndevoid of merit ” that the Court lacks federal jurisdiction to entertain them. Atakapa Indian de \nCreole Nation, 943 F.3d at 1006. Accordingly, Plaintiff’s lawsuit should be dismissed as frivolous.   \nIII. ORDER \nThe Court GRANTS  Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed In Forma Pauperis  and Financial \nAffidavit in Support ( Dkt. 2) . Case 1:23-cv-01497-RP   Document 5   Filed 01/10/24   Page 3 of 44 \n \nIV. RECOMMENDATION  \nBased on the foregoing, this  Magistrate Judge RECOMMENDS  that the District Court \nDISMISS  with prejudice  Darion Dion Frederick’s  lawsuit as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915(e)(2).   \nThe Court ORDERS  the Clerk to REMOVE  this case from the Magistrate Court’s docket and \nRETURN it to the docket of the Honorable Robert Pitman .   \nV. WARNINGS  \nThe parties may file objections to this Report and Recommendation. A party filing objections \nmust specifically identify those findings or recommendations to which objections are being made. \nThe District Court need not consider frivolous, conclusive, or general objections. See Battle v. \nUnited States Parole Comm’n, 834 F.2d 419, 421 (5th Cir. 1987). A party’s failure to file written \nobjections to the proposed findings and recommendations contained in this Report within fourteen \n(14) days after the party is s erved with a copy of the Report shall bar that party from de novo \nreview by the District Court of the proposed findings and recommendations in the Report and, \nexcept on grounds of plain error, shall bar the party from appellate review of unobjected- to \nproposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the District Court. See 28 U.S.C. \n§ 636(b)(1); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 150- 53 (1985); Douglass v. United Servs. Auto.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Whaley v. Experian Information Solutions, the court dismissed Whaley’s complaint without prejudice because it failed to provide a clear and concise statement of his claims under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Whaley, who represented himself, used AI to prepare his filings, which the court prohibited. The court granted him 10 days to file an amended complaint that meets specific requirements.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's complaint meets the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) to provide a short and plain statement of the claim showing entitlement to relief under the FCRA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint for failing to meet the standards of Rule 8(a), dismissing the complaint without prejudice, and allowing the plaintiff an opportunity to amend his complaint within 10 days.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Think of a court case like a story you need to tell clearly for anyone to understand. Elijah Whaley wrote a really long, messy version that was hard to follow, so the court said he has to rewrite it and make it clearer.

It is before the Court on Defendant’s  Fed R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)  motion \nto dismiss.  Doc. No. 17.  Plaintiff filed an opposition memorandum (Doc. No. 20), and Defendant \nsubmitted  a reply (Doc. No. 23).2  The motion is now ripe for review.  \nI. \n \n1 The Court accepts a pro se  plaintiff’s allegations as true and “construe[s] filings by pro se  litigants \nliberally.”  Owens v. Keeling , 461 F.3d 763, 776 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Spotts v. United States , 429 F.3d \n248, 250 (6th Cir. 2005)).  However, while pro se pleadings are “liberally construed” and “held to less \nstringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,” Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) \n(per curiam), pro se  plaintiffs must still satisfy basic pleading requirements.  See Hill v. Lappin, 630 F.3d \n468, 470–71 (6th Cir. 2010).  \n2 Plaintiff admit s that he used  Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to prepare  case filings.  See Doc. No. 25 at \nPageID 536–37.  T he Court reminds all parties that they are not allowed to use A I—for any purpose —to \nprepare any filings in th e instant case or any case before the undersigned.  See Judge Newman’s  Civil \nStanding Order at VI .  Both parties, and their respective counsel, have an obligation to immediately in form \nthe Court if they discover that a party has used AI to prepare any filing.  Id.   The penalty for violating this \nprovision includes, inter alia , striking the pleading from the record, the imposition of economic sanctions \nor contempt, and dismissal of t he lawsuit.  Id.  Case: 3:22-cv-00356-MJN-CHG Doc #: 26 Filed: 11/16/23 Page: 1 of 4  PAGEID #: <pageID>2 \n Plaintiff’s complaint is 8 4 pages  long.  See Doc. No. 5.  Counting attachments —consisting \nof various letters sent to Defendant in which Plaintiff complain s about allegedly unlawful \nconduct —it is 144 pages.  See Doc. No. 5- 1.  Although unclear, Plaintiff  alleges in his complaint \nthat Defendant violated the FCRA , at times and dates not apparent on the face of his various filings .  \nSee generally Doc. No. 5.  Recognizing this issue, Defendant seeks  dismissal of Plai ntiff’s verbose  \nand confusing pleading.  Doc. No. 17 at PageID 346.  \nII. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) requires that “‘[a]  pleading that states a claim for relief . . . contain,’  \namong other things, ‘ a short and plain statement of the claim  showing that the pleader is entitled \nto relief. ’”  Kensu v. Corizon, Inc., 5 F.4th 646, 649 (6th Cir. 2021) (emphasis added) (quoting \nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)).  A complaint violates Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) if “[it]  is so ‘verbose, confused \nand redundant that  its true substance, if any, is well disguise d.’”  Id.  (quoting Gillibeau v. City of \nRichmond, 417 F.2d 426, 431 (9th Cir. 1969)).  The usual remedy is dismissal without prejudice, \nwhile granting leave to amend.  Id.  \nPlaintiff’s complaint and various atta chments are “verbose, confused, and redundant,” \nviolating Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).  To state a claim under the FCRA against an eligible consumer \nreporting agency under § 1681s -2(b),3 a plaintiff must meet the “threshold showing” that the \ninformation is inacc urate or incomplete  by alleging  sufficient facts, when taken as true, to show  \n“that the information  [Defendant]  provided is false or that it contains a material omission or creates \na materially misleading impression.”   Pittman v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc. , 901 F.3d 619, 629–30 \n(6th Cir. 2018)  (citing  Boggio v. USAA Fed. Sav.

Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 901 F.3d 619, 629–30  (6th Cir. 2018)  (emphasis \ndeleted) (quoting Boggio v. USAA Fed. Sav. Bank , 696 F.3d 611, 614 (6th Cir. 2012)).  Case: 3:22-cv-00356-MJN-CHG Doc #: 26 Filed: 11/16/23 Page: 2 of 4  PAGEID #: <pageID>3 \n also Thompson v. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC , 441 F. Supp. 3d 533, 548 (E.D. Mich. 2020) \n(“[R]eporting is accurate for purposes of the FCR A as long as it is technically accurate, or accurate \non its face.” (quoting Shaw v. Equifax Info. Sols., Inc., 204 F. Supp. 3d 956, 960 (E.D. Mich. \n2016) )).   \nThis 144-page pro se  complaint only alleg es that Defendant violated the FCRA, without \nindicating what inaccurate information, if any, Defendant relayed to others .  See generally Doc. \nNo. 5.  Consequently, the complaint  is unclear  and potentially frivolous or malicious.  Id.   The \npleading consist s of irrelevant background information, interspersed quotes, and miscellaneous \nlegal citations  that do not offer Defendant a fair glimpse at what actions  could plausibly give rise \nto an FCRA claim.  Id.; see, e.g. , McComb  v. Dominium Prop. Mgmt., No. 3:20- cv-369, 2022 WL \n4395994, at *3 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 23, 2022) (dismissing amended complaint because it was  \n“intersperse[d  with] ‘excerpts from case law and numerous statutory and regulatory provisions ’ \nwith verbal and written  communications allegedly made to him by certain Defendants [,]” which \nmade it “ impossible for a Defendant to admit or deny and respond with defenses pursuant to Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 8(b)(1) ”); cf. Flayter v. Wis. Dep’t of Corr., 16 F. App’x 507, 508 (7th Cir. 2001) (“ A \nprolix and confusing complaint should be dismissed because it makes it difficult for the defendant \nto file a responsive pleading and for the court to conduct orderly litigation.” (citing Vicom, Inc. v. Harbridge Merc h. Servs., Inc. , 20 F.3d 771, 775– 76 (7th Cir. 1994))).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, the plaintiff, Joseph Michael Hunt, requested reconsideration after the court ordered him to pay partial attorney fees to the defendants, Alanis Nadine Morissette and Epiphany Productions Inc. The plaintiff's argument was partially based on information obtained from an AI program, which the court found unreliable for legal proceedings. The court denied the motion for reconsideration, affirming its original decision.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The main legal issue was whether the plaintiff's arguments, including those based on AI-generated material, could successfully challenge the court's previous order awarding attorney fees to the defendants.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the AI-generated material used by the plaintiff was unreliable and that the involvement of out-of-state counsel did not constitute unauthorized practice of law. Therefore, it denied the motion for reconsideration and maintained the order for the plaintiff to pay attorney fees.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: This is a court decision about whether the person who lost a case (Joseph) should pay the lawyer fees of the winners (Alanis and her company). Joseph tried to argue against paying using advice from a computer program (AI), but the court said that the AI made things up and wasn't helpful. The court decided that the out-of-state lawyer who helped Alanis did not do anything wrong. So, Joseph still has to pay part of Alanis's lawyer fees.",

TERRENCE G. BERG  \n \nORDER DENYING MOTION \nFOR RECONSIDERATION \n \n(ECF NO. 2 4) \n \n The Court construes ECF No. 24 as Plaintiff Joseph Michael Hunt’s \nmoving the Court to reconsider its Order at ECF No. 23. There, the Court \ngranted in part and denied in part Defendants’ Motion for Attorneys’ \nFees and Costs, ECF No. 20, and ordered Plaintiff to pay Defendants 10% of their costs incurred: $3,284.61. ECF No. 23, PageID.268.  \n Plaintiff argues that the Court erred in two ways. First, Plaintiff \nargues that Defendants’ attorneys committed “Fraud Upon The Court” either by (a) allowing attorneys not licensed in the State of Michigan to participate in this lawsuit, or (b) by allowing Stephen D. Rothschild to \nwrite a Declaration detailing the attorneys’ fees Defendants expended, which Declaration was filed by Defendants’ attorney of record, Brian Wassom. ECF No. 24, PageID.274 -76.  \n As a preliminary matter, the Court notes that Plaintiff appears to \nbase this argument on questions that he posed to an artificial intelligence (“AI”) program, and the answers that program provided. ECF No. 24 -1, Case 2:24-cv-12947-TGB-APP   ECF No. 25, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 06/11/25   Page 1 of 52 \n PageID.280 -82. AI programs “are based on complex mathematical \nsystems that learn their skills by analyzing enormous amounts of digital \ndata. They do not — and cannot — decide what is true and what is false. \nIndeed, at times , they just make stuff up —a phenomenon some A.I. \nresearchers call hallucinations.” Cade Metz & Karen Weise, A.I. Is \nGetting More Powerful, but Its Hallucinations Are Getting Worse , N.Y. \nTimes (May 6, 2025), https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/  \ntechnology/ai -hallucinations -chatgpt -google.ht ml. As such, some courts \nhave reject ed the use of such AI programs in legal pleadings  “out of \nhand” . J.G. v. New York City Dep ’t of Educ. , 719 F. Supp. 3d 293, 308 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2024). Because AI -generated material is unlikely to be helpful \nto Plaintiff, t he Court directs that  in the event Plaintiff should file any \nadditional pleadings , he should not include or rely upon AI-generated \nmaterial.  \n Plaintiff also argues that Rothschild’s participation in this case \nconstituted unauthorized practice of law. This is incorrect. ECF No. 24, \nPageID.274 -76. If Rothschild assisted in drafting Defendants’ pleadings, \nthen he did so through local counsel, Wassom. When out -of-state counsel \nassist with legal research and drafting, and make no court appearance, \nbut rather work with local counsel, this “does not con stitute the \nunauthorized practice of law.” State Treasurer v. Jackson , 448 Mich. 916, \n919 (1995) (Mic higan local counsel, Illinois out -of-state counsel). If Case 2:24-cv-12947-TGB-APP   ECF No. 25, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 06/11/25   Page 2 of 53 \n Rothschild consulted with Defendant s in this action, that is explicitly \npermitted by the Local Rules of the Eastern District of Michigan:  \n[A]n actively -licensed attorney who is not under \nsuspension or disbarment in this or another \nfederal or state court may . . . counsel a client in an action or proceeding pending in this court.  \nE.D. Mich. L.R. 83.20(i)(1)(D)(iii) (“Unauthorized Practice”).  \n Moreover, the Michigan Rules of Professional Conduct state that:  \nA lawyer admitted in another jurisdiction of the \nUnited States and not disbarred or suspended \nfrom practice in any jurisdiction may provide \ntemporary legal services in this jurisdiction that . . . are undertaken in association with a lawyer who \nis admitted  to practice in this jurisdiction and who \nactively participates in the matter.  \nMich. Pro f’l. Conduct. R. 5.5(c)(1).  \n That is what Rothschild and Wassom did here. Plaintiff also cites \nRule 8.126 of the Michigan Court Rules, which require more in terms of \nout-of-state attorney registration. ECF No. 24 -2, PageID.283. But the \nMichigan Court rules do not apply here in federal court. “The \nadministrative rules of subchapt er 8.100 apply to all courts established \nby the constitution and laws of Michigan, unless a rule otherwise \nprovides.” Mich. Ct. R. 8.101.  \n Because Rothschild’s participation in this case did not violate the \nLocal Rules of the Eastern District of Michigan or the Michigan Rules of \nProfessional Conduct , it did not constitute the unauthorized practice of \nlaw, and the Court’s award of attorneys’ fees was not in error. Plaintiff’s Case 2:24-cv-12947-TGB-APP   ECF No. 25, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 06/11/25   Page 3 of 54 \n reliance on AI instead of an attorney caused him to advance a frivolous \nargument.  \n Plaintiff also correctly points out that the Court issued its \nattorney’s fees ruling on May 30, 2025, before Plaintiff had file d his \nresponse to the motion for fees.  ECF No. 24, PageID.276. That response \nwas filed the same day,  on May 30, 2025. Id. Under the Court’s rules, \nE.D. Mich. L.R. 7.1(e)(1)(A), the Court should have waited until the day \nafter May 30, 2025 before issuing its decision, so that Plaintiff could have \nhad the entire fourteen days following Defendant’s Motion to respond.  \n Although Plaintiff is correct that the Court should have waited, \nthat mistake does not change the Court’s ruling on attorneys’ fees. The \nCourt has carefully considered all of the arguments raised in Plaintiff’s \nResponse filed May 30, 2025. None of those arguments persuade the \nCourt that it should have issued a different Order regarding the Motion \nfor Attorneys’ Fees, or that the Order should be amended.  And even \nthough Plaintiff is correct that he should have been allowed the full 14 \ndays to respond, the Co urt has the discretion to decide non -dispositive \nmotions before receiving a response. “When a non-dispositive motion is filed and adequately advises the court on the issue, the court need not \nwait for a party ’s response to that motion.” Smith v. Fender, No. 1:21 -CV-\n934, 2022 WL 18672973, at *2 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 21, 2022), report and \nrecommendation adopted , No. 1:21 -CV-00934, 2023 WL 354826 (N.D. \nOhio Jan. 23, 2023).

Therefore, the Court did not need to wait for Plaintiff’s \nresponse to be able to rule on the Motion.  \n Because Plaintiff’s Response at ECF No. 24 requests that the Court \namend an existing Order, the Court construes it as a Motion for \nReconsideration. That Motion is DENIED. Moreover, because the \nCourt’s Order Granting Defendants’ Attorneys’ Fees is still in force, the \nCourt ORDERS  that Plaintiff must pay Defendants $3,284.61.  \n SO ORDERED.  \n \nDated: June 11, 2025  /s/Terrence G.

Young Money, the plaintiff, Asia Johnson, sued Young Money for assault, libel, and slander, alleging a conspiracy involving music made about her and fake deaths facilitated by artificial intelligence.

Gray v. Martinez , 352 F. App’x 656, 658 (3d Cir. 2009) (indicating that in “this \nCircuit, . . . if [the court] is convinced that [plaintiff] is unable to pay the court costs and filing \nfees, the court will grant leave to proceed in forma pa uperis  . . . [an d] thereafter considers the \nseparate question whether the complaint should be dismissed. ”).  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1915(e),  prior to ordering service of the complaint with out payment of the filing fee, however, \nthe court must dismiss the case if it deter mines that the action is “frivolous or malicious,” 28 \n                                                           \n1 Plaintiff filed a separate suit against Beyonce Knowles Carter at Civil Action No. 18 -447 \nclaiming copyright infringemen t. Case 2:18-cv-00605-JFC   Document 4   Filed 05/16/18   Page 1 of 42 \n U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), or “fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted,” 28 U.S.C. § \n1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).   Roman v. Jeffes , 904 F.2d 192, 195 (“the appropriate time to make a decision \nto dismiss a case pursuant to § 1915  is before service of a complaint).    \nThe purpose of the in forma pauperis  statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1915 , is to assure equal and \nmeaningful access to the courts for indigent litigants.  Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 324, \n329 (1989).   Congress also provided in the in forma pauperis statute for dismissal of complaints \nunder certain circumstances in order to “prevent abusive or captious litigation” that could result \nbecause a plaintiff proceeding in forma pauperis does not have the economic incentive ordinarily \ncreated by otherwise required filing fees and costs to refrain from filing frivolous, malicious or \nrepetitive lawsuits.    Neitzke , 490 U.S. at 324.    \nA complaint filed pursuant to the in forma pauperis  statute is subject to  preservice  \ndismissal under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)2 where it is based upon indisputably meritless legal theory or \nfactual assertions that are clearly baseless.  Neitzke , 490 U.S. at 327.  In determining whether the \nfactual assertions are clearly baseless, and the complaint therefore is frivolous, t he court may \npierce the veil of the complaint and need not accept its allegations  as true .   Denton v. \nHernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 33 (1992).  Examples of baseless claims include  “claims describing \nfantastic or delusional scenarios, claims with which federal district judges are all too familiar.”  \n490 U.S. at 328.    Additionally, a s provided for  expressly by § 1915(e)(2)(ii), the court also must \ndismiss the complaint if it fails to state a claim on w hich relief can be granted, which is the same \nstandard for dismissing a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  Scheib v. \nButcher , Civ. Act. No. 14 -cv-1247, 2014 WL 4851902, at * 1 (W.D. Pa.

Case 2:18-cv-00605-JFC   Document 4   Filed 05/16/18   Page 2 of 43 \n The complaint asserts that it is brought pursuant to the court’s diversity jurisdiction, 28 \nU.S.C. § 1332, and alleges that plaintiff is a citizen of Pennsylvania and defendant “Young \nMoney” is a citizen of Texas,3 but does not provide any information with respect to the amount \nin controversy such that the court can determine if there is a good faith basis for asserting that the \namount in controversy meets the jurisdictional threshold.   The complaint in sum alleges that  \n“Baby E from young money has been making music about me.  Baby E and I used to date befor \nhis identity change his police uncle helped with he fake his death and I being harassed and Nicki \nMinaj keeps using my work Baby E (Victor Robinson)  needs helps slav es to the label to harass \nme having people jum p me and follow me.”  (ECF No. 3  at 4).   With respect  to relief, plaintiff \nindicates “I just want them to stop and let the truth be told.  Stop helping pe ople fake deaths and \nstop the 2 girls they picked to be  my actors using artificial intelligence Kenneka Jenkins and \nBreeAunna Poindexter the in dustry is involved.”  (ECF No. 3  at 4).   Attached to the complaint \nas an exhibit is a letter dated April 25, 2018 indicating that it is written on behalf of President \nDonald J. Trump presenting a certificate that plaintiff is including in the “Republican \nPresidential Honor Roll.”  (ECF No. 3-1). \nBased upon  review of the complaint, the court determines that the claims presented and \nrelief soug ht by plaintiff are based on  a fantastic or delusional  factual scenario .  Neitzke , 490 \nU.S. at 327 -328.  Ordinarily, a court must grant plaintiff the opportunity to amend, if amendment \ncan cure the deficiencies in the complaint.  Where, however, amendment cannot cure the \ndeficiencies, such as where the complaint is frivolous under § 1915(e)(2)(B)(i), the court may \ndismiss the complaint with prejudice without leave to amend.

The court granted Frontier's motion to dismiss due to Borsody's failure to name them in her EEOC complaint and denied her motion for default and sanctions. Throughout the opinion, the court emphasized that failure to exhaust administrative remedies by not identifying the correct defendant in the charge filed with the EEOC led to the dismissal. Additionally, the court cautioned the plaintiff against using generative AI for legal research, noting a nonexistent case citation, although no AI issues were directly involved in the facts of the case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue was whether the plaintiff exhausted administrative remedies by properly naming the defendant in the administrative charge with the EEOC.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies because she did not name Frontier Heritage Communities in her EEOC charge, leading to the dismissal of her complaint without prejudice.

The \nCourt can consider the right -to-sue letter under Rule 10(c) because Plaintiff attached it to her \nComplaint.  The Court can consider the administrative charge because  Plaintiff  references it in \nher Complaint, it is central to the claims in the case , and Plaintiff does not challenge the \nauthenticity of the document .13   \n C. Discussion  \nTo exhaust administrative remedies, a plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination with \neither the EEOC  or an authorized state agency and receive a right -to-sue letter based on that \ncharge.14  The Court must liberally construe the administrative charge to determine whether a \nparticular claim has been exhausted.15  The inquiry “ is generally  limited by the scope of the \nadministrative investigation that can reasonably be expected to follow  the charge of \ndiscrimination submitted to the EEOC.”16  Naming a party in the EEOC charge “is a fundamental \n \n10 Doc. 1 ¶¶ 4 –5. \n11 Doc. 1 -1. \n12 Doc. 23 -1.   \n13 See Utah Gospel Mission v.

Plaintiff responds that these entities are related; that she was “employed at a property \nmanaged by Frontier Heritage Communities, and her supervisors and HR contacts operated \nunder branding and authority of The Michaels Organization.”20  She states that they are under the \nsame “corporate umbrella,” thus , Frontier had notice of the administrative charge.  Frontier \ndenies that it had notice of the charge, and claims there is no support for Plaintiff’s claim that the \nentities are substantially identical.   \nFrontier is correct that , in general, each defendant must be specifically named in the \nadministrative charge.21  Under Tenth Circuit law, a defendant  not named in the administrative \ncharge must be dismissed if it does not meet the substantial -identity test, which requires the \nCourt to consider the following four factors:  \n(1) whether the role of the unnamed party could through \nreasonable effort by the complainant be ascertained at the time of \nthe filing of the EEOC complaint; (2) whether, under the \ncircumstances, the interests of a named party are so similar as the \nunnamed party ’s that for the purpose of obtaining voluntary \nconciliation and compliance it would be unnecessary to include the \n \n17 Lohf v.

Case 2:25-cv-02168-JAR-ADM     Document 39     Filed 11/04/25     Page 4 of 95 unnamed party in the EEOC proceedings; (3) whether its absence \nfrom the EEOC proceedings resulted in actual prejudice to the \ninterests of the unnamed party; and (4) whether the unnamed party \nhas in some way represented to the complainant that its \nrelations hip with the complainant is to be through the named \nparty.22 \n \nThe Cout has liberally construed the administrative charge in this case and assumed as \ntrue the allegations in the Complaint in considering the four factors stated above.  First, Plaintiff \ndoes not explain why she could not have discovered Frontier’s role through reasonable diligence \nwhen she filed the charge.  She claims in the response brief that Frontier managed the \nemployer’s property but that she reported to human resou rces through Michaels.  Yet, she does \nnot name Michaels as a defendant  in this matter.  Plaintiff wholly fails to explain when and how \nshe determined  that Frontier and not Michaels was the proper  Defendant before filing the instant \naction.  The Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of Frontier .   \nSecond, the Court cannot conclude on this record that Frontier’s  interests are so similar as \nMichaels’  that for the purpose of obtaining voluntary conciliation and compliance it would be \nunnecessary to include Frontier  in the EEOC proceedings .  Plaintiff makes the conclusory \nassertion  in her response that the parties are part of the same “corporate umbrella” but provides \nno allegations about this in the Complaint.   Thus, this factor also weighs in favor of Frontier.  \nThird, Plaintiff argues that Frontier’s absence from the charge did not cause it actual \nprejudice.  But this too is a conclusory assertion.  Frontier  maintains  that it was not on notice of \nthe charge.  Indeed, Plaintiff did not mention Frontier anywhere in her administrative charge.  \nThe fact that Frontier was unable to participate in voluntary conciliation during the \nadministrative process and did not receive prior notice of the lawsuit against it through the \n \n22 Blackmon v. U.S.D. 259 Sch. Dist. , 769 F. Supp. 2d 1267 , 1272  (D. Kan. 2011)  (citing Romero , 615 F.2d \nat 1311 –12). Case 2:25-cv-02168-JAR-ADM     Document 39     Filed 11/04/25     Page 5 of 96 EEOC charge constitutes actual prejudice.  This factor weighs in favor of Frontier.  \nFourth , there is nothing in the Complaint that would allow the Court to infer that \nMichaels in some way represented to Plaintiff  that its relationship with Plaintiff  is to be through \nFrontier , or vice versa .  This final factor weighs in favor of Frontier.  \nFor all of these reasons, the Court finds  that Plaintiff failed to administratively exhaust \nher claims against Frontier .23  Plaintiff asserts that equitable tolling applies because she relied on \nEEOC guidance in “naming the entity she understood to be her employer.”24  To be sure,  the \naffirmative defense of failure to timely file an EEOC charg e is subject to equitable tolling.25  \nPlaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating equitable tolling.26  It can apply when the facts “‘ rise \nto the level of active deception, ’ such as when ‘a plaintiff has been lulled into inaction by her \npast employer, state or federal agencies, or the courts. ’”27  There are no facts to support active \ndeception by the EEOC that would give rise to equitable tolling.  Certainly, the EEOC’s right -to- \nsue letter does not demonstrate active deception, i.e., that the EEOC lulled Plaintiff into \nbelieving she need not exhaust as to Frontier.   \nIn the response, Plaintiff requests leave to amend.  While the Court recognizes the \ngeneral rule that pro se  parties should be allowed leave to amend, it may appropriately dismiss a \nclaim without allowing an amendment “where it is obvious that the plaintiff cannot prevail on \n \n23 Even assuming that Plaintiff as a layperson could not discern the correct corporate Defendant to name at \nthe time she filed the charge, the other three factors weigh against her  and would still convince the Court that these \ntwo entities are not substantially identical . \n24 Doc. 24 at 2.  \n25 Lincoln v. BNSF Ry. Co. , 900 F.3d 1166 , 1183  (10th Cir. 2018) .  To be clear, Frontier did not challenge \nthe timeliness of Plaintiff’s exhaustion, only its scope.  \n26 Dumas v. Proctor & Gamble Mfg. Co. , 453 F. App ’x 819 , 821  (10th Cir. 2011) . \n27 Id. at 820 (quoting Montoya v. Chao , 296 F.3d 952, 957 (10th Cir.  2002) ). Case 2:25-cv-02168-JAR-ADM     Document 39     Filed 11/04/25     Page 6 of 97 the facts [s]he has alleged and it would be futile to give [her] an opportunity to amend.”28  “[T]he \ndistrict court should allow a plaintiff an opportunity to cure technical errors or otherwise amend \nthe complaint when doing so would yield a meritorious claim.”29  Plaintiff’s failure to exhaust is \nnot a technical error.  It’s an affirmative defense.  The Court finds that leave to amend in this \ncase would be futile because Plaintiff’s deficiencies with failure to exhaust as to the correct \ndefendant are not curable.   And Plaintiff provides no indication of how she could plead facts that \nwould avoid the exhaustion defense.  In sum, the Court grants Defendant’s motion to dismiss and \ndismisses this case without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.  \nII. Motion for Default and for Sanctions  \nPlaintiff moves for default and for sanctions because Frontier has not filed an answer to \nthe Complaint.  She repeatedly asserts that Frontier’s assertion of a procedural defense is \nsomehow wrongful.  She is mistaken.  \nWhen a party fails to plead or otherwise defend, and that fact is made to appear by \naffidavit or otherwise, default should be entered against the party.30  A defendant must serve an \nanswer within 21 days after being served with the summons and complaint or within 60 days if \nthe defendant waives service.31  However, this deadline is altered if the defendant files a motion \nunder Rule 12(b) (6),32 because such a motion  “must be made before pleading if a responsive \npleading is allowed. ”33    \n \n28 Knight v. Mooring Cap. Fund, LLC , 749 F.3d 1180, 1190 (10th Cir. 2014) (alteration in original) \n(quoting  Gee v. Pacheco , 627 F.3d 1178, 1195 (10th Cir. 2010)) . \n29 Curley v. Perry , 246 F.3d 1278 , 1284  (10th Cir. 2001) . \n30 Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(a).  \n31 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(1).  \n32 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(a)(4).  \n33 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).  Case 2:25-cv-02168-JAR-ADM     Document 39     Filed 11/04/25     Page 7 of 98 In this case, the correct summons was issued on June 23, 2025, and was returned \nexecuted on Frontier on July 7, 2025.34  Frontier sought and obtained a Clerk’s Order Extending \nTime to Answer or Otherwise Plead, which extended its answer deadline from July 28, 2025, to \nAugust 11, 2025.35  On August 11, Frontier filed its motion to dismiss  under Rule 12(b)(6), \nwhich altered its answer deadline .  It was not required to file an answer until 14 days after the \nCourt denied its motion to dismiss.  And because the Court has now granted that motion to \ndismiss, Frontier need not answer at all.  Thus, Plaintiff’s motion for default and for sanctions \nmust be denied.  \nIII. Admonition to Plaintiff  \nPlaintiff proceeds pro se in this matter, but she is subject to the same rules as attorneys \nwho appear before this Court.36  Given that Plaintiff’s response contains a citation to a case that \ndoes not exist,37 the Court is concerned that she relied on generative artificial intelligence in \ndrafting her response brief.  Plaintiff is cautioned against using artificial intelligence for drafting  \nlegal documents or citing cases without confirming their accuracy.  Pl aintiff is further directed to \nreview Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, which applies to both attorneys and unrepresented parties.   \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED  BY THE COURT that Plaintiff’s Motion for Entry \nof Default and for Sanctions (Doc. 34) is denied.  \n \n34 Doc. 18.  \n35 Doc. 19.  \n36 See D. Kan. Rule 83.5.4(f) (“Any party appearing on his or her own behalf without an attorney is \nexpected to read and be familiar with the Rules of Practice and Procedure of this court [and] the relevant Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure . . . .”).  \n37 Doc. 24 at 2 (citing Alford v. City of Canon City , 2019 WL 13202842, at *3 (D. Colo. Mar. 29, 2019)).  \nNeither the Court nor defense counsel could locate this citation.

California Department of Motor Vehicles, et al., the plaintiff, pro se, sought a temporary restraining order against the defendants to prevent the impoundment of her Toyota Prius, which she used as a residence. Gonye's claims involved an alleged international spy who developed AI and hacking software purportedly used to manipulate her car's registration and software. The court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order due to the plaintiff failing to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or significant legal questions.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a temporary restraining order preventing the California DMV and NASA from holding her vehicle, based on claims related to vehicle impoundment and alleged constitutional violations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order without prejudice, indicating the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits or serious questions related to the claims, though she did demonstrate irreparable harm due to using her car as a living space.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone is trying to stop the government from taking their car because they claim someone involved with AI and hacking meddled with it. The court said they need more convincing reasons why they should get their car back quickly compared to just waiting and proving it later.

Geren , 553 U.S. 674, 689 -690 (2008) (internal citations omitted) . An injunction is a \nmatter of equitable discretion and “may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is \nentitled to such relief.” Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) . \nA plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must establish “ [1] that he is likely to succeed on \nthe merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, [3] \nthat the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in the public interest.” Id. \nat 20. “[I ]f a plaintiff can only show that there are serious questions going to the merits – a lesser \nshowing than likelihood of success on the merits – then a preliminary injunction may still issue if \nthe balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff's favor,  and the other two Winter factors are \nsatisfied.” Friends of the Wild Swan v.

Subsequently, the Clerk’s Office entered an order construing the \nnotice of appeal as multiple notices of appeal and assigned the Bankruptcy Court’s  Minutes of \nProceeding (the “Minute Order”) as the subject of BAP No. 24-7.  \nIn the Minute Order, the Bankruptcy Court (i) found McGann was in civil contempt for \nfailure to comply with the Bankruptcy Court’s prior Order Requiring Debtor to Turnover Property to \nthe Trustee , (ii) determined the Trustee was entitled to an award of attorney’s fees as a sanction, and \n(iii) ordered the Trustee to “file a motion seeking award for attorney’s fees” by a certain date . The \nMinute Order further directed that Appellant “ may, within 7 days after the filing by the Chapter 7 \nTrustee of a motion for award of attorney’s fees , file a response contesting the amount of the request, BAP Appeal No. 24-10      Docket No. 40      Filed: 07/01/2024      Page: 1 of 32 \n but only if she has a valid factual and legal basis for doing so.”1 On February 19, 2024, the Trustee \nfiled its Motion for Award of Attorney’s Fees  (the “Fee Motion”) in the bankruptcy case, which th e \nBankruptcy Court granted (the “Fee Order”). On April 24, 2024, McGann appealed the Fee Order, \nwhich was opened as BAP No. 24-10.  \nSubsequently, this Court issued an Order to Show Cause Why Appeal Should Not Be \nDismissed for Lack of Standing in BAP No. 24-10. McGann responded2 arguing she is a “person \naggrieved” because the Fee Order directly and adversely affects her pecuniary interest and thus she \nhas standing. She acknowledges she failed to object to the Fee Order but argues this should not \npreclude he r from having standing given her status as a pro se litigant. The Chapter 7 Trustee \nresponded arguing McGann (1) has waived her right to appeal the Fee Order by failing to object to the Fee Motion, (2) is not a person aggrieved because her burdens have not  increased, and (3) has not \nshown her neglect in failing to object to the Fee Motion was excusable.  \n“Standing is a threshold issue in every federal case.”\n3 Because the issue of standing is \njurisdictional, it remains open to review at all stages of litigation.4 This Court “has an independent \nduty to inquire into its jurisdiction over a dispute, even where neither party contests it.”5 Only a \n‘person aggrieved’ by a bankruptcy court’s order may appeal.”6 Additionally, t he Tenth Circuit has \n \n1 Minute Order at 3.  \n2 We note that many of the cases cited by Appellant do not appear to be real cases.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Joseph Lee Jones v. United States Copyright Office and Patents, the plaintiff sought mandamus relief to obtain forms for copyright and patent submissions related to his research on artificial intelligence, but his case was dismissed due to his failure to pay the required filing fee. Despite multiple motions for relief from judgment, the court denied his requests, citing a lack of exceptional circumstances under Rule 60(b). The case involves AI as the plaintiff's submissions were focused on obtaining intellectual property rights for his AI research.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff was entitled to relief from the previous dismissal of his case under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for failure to pay the district court filing fee as a prisoner subject to the \"3-strike\" rule.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff did not demonstrate any exceptional circumstances or valid grounds under Rule 60(b) to justify relief from judgment. Consequently, the motions were denied, and the case remained closed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you’re playing a game where you have three chances to get a prize, but every time you lose, you get a strike. If you get three strikes, you owe a fee to try again. Joseph Lee Jones tried to get a court to help him with rules for his AI ideas, but he already had three strikes and didn’t pay the fee, so the court said no.

CASE NO.  15-3098-JWL \n UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT OFFICE AND PATENTS,    Defendant.    \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER \n  Plaintiff initiated this action seeking mandamus relief on allegations related to his \ninability to obtain copyright and patent forms fo r submitting his published research on artificial \nintelligence, and the lack of any response by the United States Copyright Office to Plaintiff’s \nsubmissions.  Plaintiff subsequent ly expanded his allegations to in clude his inability to obtain or \nfile forms to patent or trademark a “Fractal.”   \n In an order dated January 26, 2016, the Court examined Plaintif f’s litigation history in the \nDistrict of Kansas and found Plaintiff subject to the “3-strike” provision in 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g), \nwhich required Plaintiff to pay the full $400.00 di strict court filing fee in the instant action \nabsent a showing that Plaintiff is under an imminen t danger of serious physical harm if he is not \nallowed to proceed on the claims in his complain t. Finding nothing in Plaintiff’s allegations to \nsuggest such a showing could be made in this case,  the Court denied Plaintiff leave to proceed in \nforma pauperis and directed Pl aintiff to submit the $400.00 dist rict court filing fee to avoid Case 5:15-cv-03098-JWL-DJW   Document 44   Filed 09/25/24   Page 1 of 42 \n dismissal of the complaint based upon Plaintiff’s failure to satisf y the district court filing fee \nrequired by 28 U.S.C. § 1914. \nOn February 9, 2016, the Court liberally cons trued Plaintiff’s “Motion for Relief of \nJudgment” of that “3-strike” order as seeking reconsideration of the non-dispositive order entered on January 26, 2016.  The Court noted th at Plaintiff had not challenged the Court’s \nfinding that Plaintiff was a prisoner as define d by 28 U.S.C. § 1915(h) when he initiated the \ninstant action, and that Plaintiff’s litigation histor y in this Court includes three or more cases \nPlaintiff filed as a prisoner th at are “strikes” within the mean ing of § 1915(g).  Finding nothing \nin Plaintiff’s motion satisfied a ny criteria for reconsideration of a non-dispositive order, the \nCourt denied the motion and granted Plaintiff a limited extension of time to submit the $400.00 \ndistrict court filing fee.  Because Plaintiff did not submit the requir ed payment, the Court \ndismissed this action on February  24, 2016.  (Doc. 32.)  Plaintiff appealed, and his appeal was \ndismissed for lack of prosecution.  (Doc. 37.) \nOn February 22, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for relief from judgment (Doc. 39).  The \nCourt entered an Orde r (Doc. 40) denying the motion on Fe bruary 23, 2021.  Now, over three \nyears later, Plaintiff has filed another Motion to Reopen (Doc. 41)  and a motion (Doc. 42) titled a \n“Motion for Relief of Judgment Seeking Mandamus  and also Motion to Revisit Utility Patent \nand Trademark protection for injunctive Relief  upon review of materi als published by Reuters \nWestlaw . . ..”   \nPlaintiff’s motion is treated as a motion filed under Rule 60( b) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, seeking relief from  judgment entered in this matter. See Weitz v. Lovelace \nHealth System Inc., 214 F.3d 1175, 1178 (10th Cir. 2000). Rule 60( b) provides in relevant part \nthat: Case 5:15-cv-03098-JWL-DJW   Document 44   Filed 09/25/24   Page 2 of 43 \n On motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgmen t, order, or proceeding for the \nfollowing reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered ev idence that, with reasonable \ndiligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether previously called \nintrinsic or extrinsic), misrepr esentation, or misconduct by an \nopposing party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has \nbeen satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed  or vacated; or applying it \nprospectively is no longer equitabl e; or (6) any ot her reason that \njustifies relief. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). \nA Rule 60(b) motion provides extraordinary relief which “may only be granted in \nexceptional circumstances.” Amoco Oil Co. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, \n231 F.3d 694, 697 (10th Cir. 2000). The decision to grant such relief “is extraordinary and may \nonly be granted in exceptional circumstances.” Servants of the Paraclete v. Does, 204 F.3d 1005, \n1009 (10th Cir. 2000) (quot ation marks omitted). \nHaving reviewed the record, the Court denies Plaintiff's motion for re lief from judgment.  \nPlaintiff’s motion is larg ely incomprehensible, but appears to s eek the relief he initially sought in \nthis action and realleges hi s original claims seeki ng copyright and patent fo rms.  Plaintiff alleges \nno grounds for relief under Rule 60 (b) and filed this motion more th an eight years after his case \nwas closed.  The Court finds Plaintiff has failed to show good cause or “exceptional \ncircumstances” warranting relief under Rule 60(b). \nIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Clerk is directed to reopen this case for \npurposes of entering this Memorandum and Order. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiff’s moti ons (Docs. 41, 42) are denied. \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Clerk is direct ed to close this case.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In this case, Lionel Villeneuve sought intervention from the federal court to oversee a state court case involving a payment dispute for medical services, claiming the state judge's handling of matters was unsatisfactory. The plaintiff attempted to invoke federal jurisdiction by asserting a civil rights violation and sought accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. In the facts of the case, it is noted that the plaintiff used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help present his claims. The court dismissed the case, applying the Younger abstention doctrine, which limits federal court interference in ongoing state judicial proceedings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the federal court should exercise jurisdiction and intervene in an ongoing state court proceeding concerning alleged failures to accommodate under the Americans with Disabilities Act and potential due process violations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court dismissed the plaintiff’s case, concluding that under the Younger abstention doctrine, it is inappropriate for a federal court to intervene in state court proceedings that address significant state interests and provide adequate opportunities to raise federal claims. The court also found no compelling evidence of bad faith or misconduct by the state judge to warrant an exception to the abstention doctrine.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you're playing a board game with your friends, and you're upset about a rule a friend (who is temporarily the game master) is enforcing. Instead of arguing within your group, you go to a neighbor to complain and ask them to take over the game. In this case, the judge is like the neighbor who tells you, “I can’t step in and dictate your friend's game unless there's something seriously unfair going on.” Also interestingly, you used a “virtual assistant” (AI) to help explain your problem, but your neighbor still can’t switch roles with your friend just because you didn't like how the game was played.",

ECF No. 6.  In it, Magistrate Judge Wolf recommends the \nsummary dismissal of Plaintiff’s action for multiple reasons.  The plaintiff  filed an objection to the \nRecommended Decision on May 7, 2025.  ECF No. 7.   \nThis action arises out of a law suit filed against Plaintiff in state court to recover fees for \ncertain medical care that he alleges was fraudulent  and/or undeserving of compensation due to the \nharms it caused him .  Dissatisfied with the state court judge’s handling of certain of his motions  \nor requests , Plaintiff asks this Court to remove the state court judge from the state court case, \nvacate all of the judge’s prior orders, direct the appointment of a guardian ad litem to serve \nPlaintiff’s interests in the state court proceeding, instruct the state court as to all the necessary \naccommodations Plaintiff must receive under the Americans with Disabilities Act to ensure he \nenjoys meaningful access to the state court , and declare that the dispute over payment be resolved \nin his favor, including by making MaineCare the only responsible party for payment .   \n Case 1:25-cv-00180-LEW     Document 9     Filed 06/17/25     Page 1 of 3    PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n Defendants , who include the state court judge, Governor Janet Mills, Department of Health \nand Human Services Commissioner Sara Gagne- Holmes, and the care provider, have not been \nserved and have not appeared in the action.   \nI have reviewed and considered the Recommended Decision and the Objection, together \nwith the entire record; I have made a de novo determination of all matters adjudicated by the \nRecommended Decision; and I concur with the recommendations of the United States Magistrate \nJudge that dismissal is appropriate in this case .   \nFrom a comparison of the allegations and the requested relief, it is plain that the Governor \nand the Commissioner are not proper parties on any federal claim, including the civil rights claim brought under 28 U.S.C. § 1983, because they have not engaged in state action toward Plaintiff \nand have no personal involvement in the payment dispute. \nThe only remaining federal cause involves , essentially, a failure -to-accommodate /due \nprocess  claim brought against the state court judge.  Plaintiff wants this Court to oversee and direct \nthe future course of proceeding in the state court , including in relation to the appointment of a \nguardian ad litem  and any other accommodations he might require .  In other words, Plaintiff wants \nthis Court to administer proceedings in the state court.\n1   \nI agree with Magistrate Judge Wolf that the relief requested by Plaintiff calls for application \nof the Younger  abstention doctrine , see Younger v. Harris , 401 U.S. 37 (1971), the federalism and \ncomity principle that federal courts should abstain  from interfering with ongoing state proceedings \nthat are judicial in nature, involve important state interests, provide an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims, and do not contain special circumstances t hat would \n \n1 I note that Plaintiff does not appear by guardian or next friend in this litigation and, evidently, relies on \nthe assistance of someone in his confidence and Artificial Intelligence queries to present his claims.  See \nObj. Addendum (ECF No. 7- 1). Case 1:25-cv-00180-LEW     Document 9     Filed 06/17/25     Page 2 of 3    PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n make abstention inappropriate.  Here, the important state interest entails the very administration \nof proceedings and the interference entails, in effect, a collateral challenge to an order denying \nappointment of a guardian.   \nState courts “have important interests in administering certain aspects of their judicial \nsystems.”  Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 12- 13 (1987).  Although a federal court may \ntake up a case where a state forum inadequately protects federal rights, Sirva Relocation, LLC v. \nRichie , 794 F.3d 185, 192 (1st Cir. 2015), the Maine State Courts are an adequate forum to raise \nand obtain reasonable relief on due process/accommodation requests associated with a litigant’s access to the courts , including in the context of an appeal .  To the extent Plaintiff alleges bad faith \nor flagrant misconduct  by the appointed judge  in order to invoke an exception to the Younger  \ndoctrine, his allegations in that regard are conclusory and devoid of any development.  As such, the factual allegations do not support a non- speculative inference that the state court judge is \nentering rulings based on malice, bias, or another form of bad faith. \nFinally, because this Court is not assuming jurisdiction over a federal claim, I further agree \nwith the Magistrate Judge that it would be improper to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a state law dispute between Plaintiff and a care provider over payment for services.  \nFor these reasons, the Recommended Decision of the Magistrate Judge (ECF No. 6)  is \nhereby A\nDOPTED  and t he case is dismissed.  \n \nSO ORDERED . \n \nDated this 17th day of June, 2025. \n \n \n  /s/ Lance E.

KUNTZ, II, United States District Judge:\nJeramy Micheal Cordell Hill (\"PlaintifP')^ currently incarcerated at the Anna M. Kross Center\n(\"AMKC\") on Rikers Island, brings this pro se complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\nGoDaddy Company (\"Defendant\"). On October 3, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiffs request to\nproceed in forma pauperis pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915. For the reasons discussed below, the\ncomplaint is dismissed.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B), a district court shall dismiss an in forma pauperis\naction where it is satisfied that the action \"(i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim\non which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune\nfrom such relief.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). At the pleadings stage of the proceeding, the\nCourt must assume the truth of \"all well-pleaded, nonconclusory factual allegations\" in the\ncomplaint. Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.^ 621 F.3d 111, 124 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing\nAshcroft V. Iqbaly 556 U.S. 662, 678-79 (2009)). A complaint must plead sufficient facts to\n\"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,\n570 (2007). Furthermore, it is axiomatic that pro se complaints are held to less stringent\nstandards than pleadings drafted by attorneys and the Court is required to read the plaintiff s pro\n1Case 1:18-cv-05251-WFK-LB   Document 7   Filed 10/26/18   Page 1 of 3 PageID #: <pageID>se complaint liberally and interpret it to raise the strongest arguments it suggests.

Sealed\nDefendant #7, 537 F.3d 185, 191-93 (2d Cir. 2008).\nHowever, the Supreme Court has held that a district court has \"the authority to 'pierce the\nveil of the complaint's factual allegations'\" when considering an in forma pauper is complaint.\nDenton v. Hernandez, 504 U.S. 25, 32 (1992). The Court further stated that \"a court is not bound\n... to accept without question the truth of the plaintiffs allegations. We therefore reject the\nnotion that a court must accept 'as having an arguable basis in fact,' all allegations that cannot be\nrebutted by judicially noticeable facts.\" Id. (citation omitted).\nDISCUSSION\nPlaintiffs complaint is nonsensical and does not present any conceivable claim. For\nexample. Plaintiff states that he brings this action against Defendant\nfor Milnillion Googloplex Googloplexs dollars, for creating the domain name \"The\nSocial Music Club\" and nobody paying me, for creating the most intelligence thing\never in history.... I have waited six years for, \"Go Daddy Company\" too [sic] send\na check out of respect, but no check has c[o]me....

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Joseph Lee Jones initiated a court case to seek mandamus relief related to difficulties in obtaining copyright and patent forms for his published research on artificial intelligence (AI) and his ability to file forms for patent or trademark a “Fractal.” The court dismissed his case, invoking the \"3-strike\" rule which prevents prisoners with multiple dismissals from filing new claims unless under imminent danger of serious harm. Jones later filed a motion seeking relief from the judgment, which was denied due to lack of new grounds and untimeliness.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff, who is subjected to the \"3-strike\" rule, can be relieved from the requirement to pay the full district court filing fee based on his claims related to obtaining forms for copyright and patent purposes.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the plaintiff's motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b), finding no grounds for relief, lack of exceptional circumstances, and the motion being untimely.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Joseph Lee Jones wanted the court to help him get forms to protect his ideas about AI, but because he had lost too many court cases already, the court wouldn't let him proceed without paying a fee. He tried to get the decision changed, saying he should be able to proceed without paying because the original decision was wrong, but the court said no again because he didn’t show there was any mistake or new evidence and he waited too long to ask.",

CASE NO.  15-3098-SAC \n UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT OFFICE AND PATENTS,    Defendant.   \nO R D E R \n  Plaintiff initiated this action seeking mandamus relief on allegations related to his \ninability to obtain copyright and patent forms fo r submitting his published research on artificial \nintelligence, and the lack of any response by the United States Copyright Office to Plaintiff’s \nsubmissions.  Plaintiff subsequent ly expanded his allegations to in clude his inability to obtain or \nfile forms to patent or trademark a “Fractal.”   \n In an order dated January 26, 2016, the Court examined Plaintif f’s litigation history in the \nDistrict of Kansas and found Plaintiff subject to the “3-strike” provision in 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g), \nwhich required Plaintiff to pay the full $400.00 di strict court filing fee in the instant action \nabsent a showing that Plaintiff is under an imminen t danger of serious physical harm if he is not \nallowed to proceed on the claims in his complain t. Finding nothing in Plaintiff’s allegations to \nsuggest such a showing could be made in this case,  the Court denied Plaintiff leave to proceed in \nforma pauperis and directed Pl aintiff to submit the $400.00 dist rict court filing fee to avoid \ndismissal of the complaint based upon Plaintiff’s failure to satisf y the district court filing fee \nrequired by 28 U.S.C. § 1914. Case 5:15-cv-03098-JWL-DJW   Document 40   Filed 02/23/21   Page 1 of 32 \n On February 9, 2016, the Court liberally cons trued Plaintiff’s “Motion for Relief of \nJudgment” of that “3-strike” order as seeking reconsideration of the non-dispositive order entered on January 26, 2016.  The Court noted th at Plaintiff had not challenged the Court’s \nfinding that Plaintiff was a prisoner as define d by 28 U.S.C. § 1915(h) when he initiated the \ninstant action, and that Plaintiff’s litigation histor y in this Court includes three or more cases \nPlaintiff filed as a prisoner th at are “strikes” within the mean ing of § 1915(g).  Finding nothing \nin Plaintiff’s motion satisfied a ny criteria for reconsideration of a non-dispositive order, the \nCourt denied the motion and granted Plaintiff a limited extension of time to submit the $400.00 \ndistrict court filing fee.  Because Plaintiff did not submit the requir ed payment, the Court \ndismissed this action on February  24, 2016.  (Doc. 32.)  Plaintiff appealed, and his appeal was \ndismissed for lack of prosecution.  (Doc. 37.) \nOn February 22, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion  for relief from judgment (Doc. 39).  \nPlaintiff’s motion is treated as  a motion filed under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, seeking relief from judgment entered in this matter. See Weitz v. Lovelace Health \nSystem Inc., 214 F.3d 1175, 1178 (10th Cir. 2000). Rule 60(b)  provides in relevant part that: \nOn motion and just terms, the court may relieve a party or its legal \nrepresentative from a final judgmen t, order, or proceeding for the \nfollowing reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered ev idence that, with reasonable \ndiligence, could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether previously called \nintrinsic or extrinsic), misrepr esentation, or misconduct by an \nopposing party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has \nbeen satisfied, released, or discharged; it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed  or vacated; or applying it \nprospectively is no longer equitabl e; or (6) any ot her reason that \njustifies relief. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b). Case 5:15-cv-03098-JWL-DJW   Document 40   Filed 02/23/21   Page 2 of 33 \n A Rule 60(b) motion provides extraordinary relief which “may only be granted in \nexceptional circumstances.” Amoco Oil Co. v. United States Environmental Protection Agency, \n231 F.3d 694, 697 (10th Cir. 2000).

Plaintiff seeks the reli ef he initially sought in this action and reallege s his original \nclaims seeking copyright and patent forms.  Plaintiff a lleges no grounds for relief under \nRule 60(b) and filed this motion five years after his case was clos ed.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied Freedom Cheteni's renewed motion for a temporary restraining order, which sought to prevent state educational officials from suspending federal financial assistance to his non-public school. The court concluded that Cheteni failed to demonstrate any material change in law or facts that would justify revisiting the initial denial of his motion. Notably, the court advised against utilizing artificial intelligence-based tools that might detrimentally affect Cheteni's legal standing.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Freedom Cheteni demonstrated new material facts or a significant change in law that would warrant reconsideration of the court's previous denial of a temporary restraining order.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Cheteni did not meet the necessary conditions under Local Rule 7-9(b) for reconsideration, as he failed to show a material difference in fact or law or any new significant materials that could impact the case's outcome.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're asking your teacher for extra time to complete a homework assignment, but they said no because you didn't have a good reason. You tried asking again without any new facts about why you needed more time, and your teacher still said no. Also, it's like your teacher advising you not to rely too much on spell-check or grammar tools for your writing, because they might trip you up with mistakes you don't notice. In this case, the court told Cheteni no again because he didn't have any new reasons strong enough to change their mind, and they also suggested not relying too much on AI tools that might misguide him in his arguments.",

No. 67  \n \n \n On January 7, 2025, the Court denied pro se plaintiff  Freedom Cheteni ’s request for a \ntemporary restraining order and mandatory injunction.  Dkt. No. 58.  The Court determined that \nplaintiff had not made the requisite showing of a likelihood of success on the merits of his case.  Id. \nat 13.  On January 31, 2025, the Court held an initial case management conference during which the \nCourt set a hearing schedule for defendants’ upcoming motion for judgment on the pleadings under \nRule 12(c) of the Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure.  Dkt. No. 66.  On February 3, 2025, plaintiff \nfiled a renewed motion for a temporary restraining order.  Dkt. No. 67.1  Pursuant to Civil Local \nRule 7 -1(b), the Court determines that plaintiff’s  motion is suitable for resolution without oral \nargument, and VACATES the February 28, 2025 hearing.  \n The Court DENIES plaintiff’s renewed motion for a temporary restraining order.  The \nmotion requests the Court to reconsider its prior holding from January 7, 2025.  Pursuant to Local \nRule 7 -9(a), a motion for reconsideration may only be filed with leave o f the Court .  Plaintiff \n \n1 Plaintiff labeled this motion on the docket as “ Second MOTION for Judgment on the \nPleadings  TRO based on New Controlling Law , First ADMINISTRATIVE MOTION TRO  Based \non State of NY et al vs. Trump .”  After review of the substantive filing, the Court determines this is \nin fact a renewed motion for a temporary restraining order, not a motion for judgment on the \npleadings.  Case 3:23-cv-06286-SI     Document 68     Filed 02/04/25     Page 1 of 2 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  previously requested and was denied leave to move for reconsideration of the denial of his motion \nfor partial summary judgment, Dkt. Nos. 61, 63, but plaintiff has not requested leave to file a motion \nfor reconsideration of the Court’s denial of a temporar y restraining order.  Further, had plaintiff \nrequested leave, the Court would have denied the request .   \nPlaintiff has not shown a material difference in fact or law, the emergence of new material \nfacts or changes in the law, or a manifest failure by the Court to consider the material facts and law, \nas required by Local Rule 7 -9(b).  The impetus for plaintiff ’s motion seems to be a recent temporary \nrestraining order in another court prohibiting the new presidential administration from suspending \nall federal financial assistance.  If a court may prevent the president from suspending financial \nassistance, plaint iff seems to reason,2 this Court should prevent state educational officials from \nsuspending the delivery of federal financial assistance to the non -public school he runs.  Plaintiff’s \nanalogy  is not convincing.  Nor does it address defendants’ asserted rationale for suspending funds \nfor his school: the school could not provide adequate verification of eligibility for those funds after \nbeing given an opportunity to do so.  In short, t here has been no material change in the law relevant \nto plaintiff’s case.  Therefore, the Court DENIES plaintiff’s latest motion for a temporary restraining \norder  at Docket Number 67 . \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED . \nDated:  February 4, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nSUSAN ILLSTON  \nUnited States District Judge  \n \n2 The reasoning in plaintiff’s brief is not always clear.  Further, t he motion  cites cases which \ndo not support the propositions for which they are offered  and whose facts bear no relation to the \nfacts at issue in this case.  See Dkt. No. 67 at 4 (citing Bldg. & Const. Trades Dep’t v. Allbaugh , 295 \nF.3d 28 (D.C. Cir. 2002), Norton v. SUWA , 542 U.S. 55 (2004), and Dalton v. Specter , 511 U.S. \n462 (1994)).  The Court sympathizes with the position of pro se plaintiffs who must learn and explain \ncomplicated legal questions.  The Court encourages plaintiff to continue to use the  free legal \nresources available to pro se plaintiffs as previously recommended.  See Dkt. No. 15 at 9.  At the \nsame time, the Court discourages the use of other tools like artificial intelligence -based tools that \nmay ultimately harm rather than help plaintiff’s standing in this litigation.  \nCase 3:23-cv-06286-SI     Document 68     Filed 02/04/25     Page 2 of 2",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Nevarez v. Forty Niners Football Company, LLC, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California addressed the Defendant's electronic stored information (ESI) production efforts in response to a discovery request. The Defendants utilized predictive artificial intelligence to help identify non-responsive documents out of approximately 297,000 documents, but were unable to establish a sufficient \"cut-off\" point to exclude non-relevant documents without full review. The Court ordered the Defendants to complete the document production by October 19, 2018, and required an affidavit of completion under penalty of perjury, noting that sanctions would be considered if they failed to comply.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Defendants could use predictive AI to manage the large volume of potentially responsive documents and set a “cut-off” point for productions without full review.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Court held that Defendants must produce all documents by the set deadline and could not arbitrarily cut off document production using AI without a clear justification. The court emphasized compliance with existing safeguards against misuse of produced documents.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: The court told the football company they had to share all the documents related to the case by October 19th, even though their computer programs couldn't perfectly sort out what's important.

As noted \nat the hearing, efforts to facilitate the productive of responsive documents, while alway s a \nchallenge with ESI, promote  litigation and judicial efficiency and therefore benefits all parties.  \nThe Court expects the Parties to continue these efforts until the production is complete.  \nSecond, Defenda nts expressed concerns regarding the approximately 297,000 documents \ncurrently identified by search terms but as yet unreviewed, particularly with certain search terms \ncontinuing to return some percentage of non -responsive documents.  Defendants expressed \nparticular con cern for non-responsive documents that may contain privileged information or raise \nthird -party privacy concerns that may be produced absent r eview of the documents in advance of \nproduction.   This dilemma is not uncommon in ESI productions.  Defendants hav e, \nconstructively, adopted the use of predictive artificial intelligence programs to assist in the \nidentification of non-responsive documents en masse within the unreviewed documents.

Given that the Parties are already well past the close of \ndiscovery, there is not time to develop such an  argument, and the Court will not permit Defendants \nto adopt such a cut -off point arbitrarily.  Fortunately, the Parties have other safeguards in place to \nprevent the mis -use of produced documents that contain the agreed upon search terms  but are \neither un responsive, privileged or otherwise protected,  such as the Protective Order (ECF 97) and \nFederal Rule of Evidence 502(b) protections against inadvertent disclosures , which the Parties \nhave agreed will apply under these circumstances.    \nThe Parties may, at  Defendants discretion, continue to meet and confer regarding the use of \npredictive coding as a means of identifying documents that are unlikely to be responsive and thus \ndo not need to be produced in this action.  However, absent any agreement on such ide ntification, \nDefendants’ entire ESI production, whether or not Defendant s have  been able to review all of the \ndocuments in advance of production, must be turned over to Plaintiffs by 5 :00 p.m. on Friday, \nOctober 19, 2018, as previously ordered by the Court .  See ECF 241.  \nThe Court further ORDERS  that Defendants submit an affidavit  on October 19, 2018 , \nexecuted by counsel under penalty of perjury, that the ESI production has been completed.  If the \naffidavit is not provided, counsel for Plaintiffs and Defend ants are ORDERED  to appear before \nthis Court on Monday, October 22, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. for assessment of sanctions pursuant to  this \nCourt’s October 10, 2018 O rder.   \nSO ORDERED.  \n \nDated:  October 16, 2018  \n \n  \nSUSAN VAN KEULEN  \nUnited States Magistrate Judge  \nCase 5:16-cv-07013-LHK   Document 254   Filed 10/16/18   Page 2 of 2",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of *United States v. Goran Gogic*, the defendant is charged with international narcotics trafficking, with evidence including intercepted encrypted communications from the Sky ECC platform. The court reviewed motions concerning the authentication and admissibility of this evidence, which was decrypted by European law enforcement using AI tools. The court allowed certain evidence after establishing a preliminary framework for its authentication based on witness testimony and corroborating evidence but denied other data lacking a reliable foundation.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the intercepted and decrypted communications from the Sky ECC platform can be authenticated and admitted as evidence, given the lack of detailed information about the seizure and decryption process, and whether the defendant's motions to suppress such evidence, due to alleged unlawful surveillance or insufficient authentication, should be granted.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the defendant’s motion to suppress the Sky Evidence, finding no sound basis to revisit the previous ruling. It also allowed parts of the Sky Evidence to be admitted based on proposed witness testimony, while excluding other segments due to insufficient authentication. Some expert testimony from the defense on the reliability and digital forensic standards regarding the evidence was admitted with limitations.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you found messages hidden in a secret code used for a treasure hunt, and you want to show them as proof in a big important meeting. But, the messages were unlocked by other people across the sea, using special tools like secret decoder rings, and there’s a debate about how they did it. The court in this case decided it mostly trusts the messages are real because they have some proof from people who can confirm the messages connect to the hunt, but other messages weren’t allowed because the court wasn’t sure they were decoded correctly. Also, some experts will tell the meeting about any weird mistakes or changes in the messages because the meeting folks might not understand the secret code stuff on their own.",

(See Indict., ECF No.  1.)  In advance of trial, the parties \nhave filed several motions in limine  related to evidence of electronic communications that were  \npurportedly seized and decrypted by European law enforcement . (Def.’s  Mot. in Limine (“Def.’s  \nMIL,”) ECF No. 94, at 1–19; Gov’t Mot. in Limine (“Gov’t MIL ”), ECF No. 96, at 8–13, 22–29; \nDef.’s Suppl. Mot. in Limine (“Def’s Suppl. M IL”), ECF No. 129, at 3–7.)   My tentative ruling s \nregarding that evidence  are set forth below, with final ruling s reserved until trial.   My rulings on \nthe parties ’ other motions in  limine  will be addressed  at the final  pretrial conference. \nI. BACKGROUND \nI assume familiarity with the allegations against Defendant,  which are discussed at length \nin previous opinions resolving Defendant’s suppression motions ( see January 8, 2025 Op. & Order  \n(“January 2025 Op.”) , ECF No. 79  (denying motion to suppress evidence of electronic \ncommunications obtained from French law enforcement ); March 17, 2025 Op. & Order  (“March \nFILED \nCLERK \n \n \nU.S. DISTRICT  COURT \nEASTERN  DISTRICT OF NEW YORK \nLONG  ISLAND OFFICE \n10/31/2025 2:03 pmCase 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 1 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n 2025 Op.”) , ECF No. 25 (denying motion to suppress evidence obtained from Defendant’s \niPhone) ), and recount only those facts that are necessary to the resolution of the instant in  limine  \nmotions.  \nA. The Sky Evidence  \n This case involves an alleged conspiracy between Defendant  and various  members of an \ninternational nar cotics trafficking network that coordinated the acquisition and transport of large \namounts of cocaine from South America to Europe , by way of the United States , on commercial \ncontainer ships .  Defendant is charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the MDLEA \nbetween May 2018 and June 2019 and three substantive violations of the MDLEA in connection \nwith shipments that were seized at U.S. ports on February 27, March 18, and June 19, 2019.  \n(Indict. ¶¶ 1–4.)  At trial, the Government intends to prove that Defendant  was a “critical link” \nbetween suppliers in South America, ship crewmembers, and distribut ors in Europe.  (Gov’t MIL \nat 7.)  As evidence, the Government plans to offer  excerpts from electronic communications that \nwere allegedly sent between Defendant  and other members of the conspiracy over an encrypted \nmessaging platform called Sky ECC (“Sky”).  ( Id. at 4.)    \nAccording to the parties’ briefs, t he communications in question were seized and decrypted  \nby law enforcement in Europe as part of a joint investigation that involved French, Belgian, and \nDutch law enforcement.  ( See Def.’s MIL at 20 –23 ( discussing “international investigation of Sky \nECC” ); Gov’t Resp. to Def.’s MIL (“Gov’t Resp.”), ECF 107, at 19 n.5 (stating that European law \nenforcement operation was governed by a “ Joint Investigation Team ( ‘JIT’) agreement ”).)  The \nGovernment obtained electronic records  of certain such communications from a French official , \npursuant to a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (“MLAT”) between the United States and France.  \n(Gov’t MIL  at 1; Gov’t Suppl. Letter Resp. to 10/16 Order, ECF No. 148 (“Gov’t Suppl. Letter”) Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 2 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n at 1–2.)  To obtain the records , a Department of Justice (“DOJ”) officer sent a written  MLAT  \nrequest for content associated with specific Sky user accounts, each of which is denominated by a \nfive character “Sky PIN ,” believed to belong to Defendant.  ( See Gov’t  Suppl. Letter, Ex. B  \n(MLAT Request dated Feb. 14, 2023).)  The MLAT request specifically identified, inter  alia, Sky \nPINs 28A508 and 5UIP0T  as belonging to Defendant.  ( Id. at 6.)  French officials complied with \nthe MLAT  request and transmitted electronically a large set of spreadsheets and media files (the \n“Sky Evidence”).  ( See Gov’t Reply in Supp. of MIL (“Gov’t Reply”), ECF No. 118, at 2, 4, 11–\n12.)1  The transmission was accompanied by an official document that bears the heading Procès -\nVerbal  attesting to the file names contained in the  transmission and signed by a member of the \nFrench National Judicial Police.  (Gov’t Suppl. Letter at 1–2.)   \nThe Government has produced to Defendant and submitted to the Court a  complete  copy \nof the Sky Evidence  in the form that it was received from France, along  with a list of the specific \nexcerpts that the Government intends to offer as trial exhibits.  ( See Gov’t Reply at 2, 4–5; Gov’t \nExhibit List (Oct. 4, 2025) (“ 10/14/25 Ex. List”) at 3 –8.)2  Given the somewhat unusual format of \nthe Sky Evidence, I provide a brief description to ground the legal analysis  that follows .  The  Sky \nEvidence consists of the following files:  \n(1) T wo spreadsheets that contain account metadata , including the associated user aliases,  \nfor Sky PINs 28A508 and 5UIP0T (the “Metadata Spreadsheets”) ; \n \n(2) 179 separate folders that each contain a spreadsheet of messages from a single \nconversation thread, or “chat,” between two or more Sky users (the “Chat Spreadsheets”) ; \n \n \n1 The Government received records of communications for many  other Sky PINs  through a similar process  and has \nmarked as potential trial exhibits  several such records for other Sky PINs .  (See Gov’t Suppl. Letter at 2 –3; id. Exs. \nA, C & D.)  Because the parties ’ motions in limine  explicitly address only  evidence of Mr. Gogic’s purported \ncommunications, I use the phrase “Sky Evidence” to refer solely to the records produced by France in connection with \nSky PINs 28A508 and 5UIP0T and confine my analysis accordingly.    \n \n2 The Government’s Exhibit List was provided directly to my chambers via USAfx and were not filed on the docket.   Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 3 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n (3) Subfolder s labeled “media” that contains,  inter alia, digital images  and recordings  (the \n“Media Subfolders”) . (See Gov’t Reply at 5 –7, 9.)   \n \nThe Chat Spreadsheets are formatted to show the information for a single message in each row, \nwith the message timestamp, sender ’s ID, and content of the message separated into distinct \ncolumn cells .  (See id. at 9.)  There are also columns labeled, inter alia, “language,” “ingest_date,” \nand “new since [date].” ( See id. at 10.)  According to the Government ’s brief , the latter  columns \nreflect the workflow of  the European intelligence officers  who decrypted the seized \ncommunications  “through an iterative process.”  ( Id.)  Where there is a M edia Subfolder, each file \nappears to correspond to a row in the C hat Spreadsheet.  ( See id.)  Assuming information contained \nin Metadata Spreadsheets are accurate, the Sky Evidence consists of communications that occurred \nbetween June 24, 2019, and March 9, 2021.  ( Id. at 6; see GX115 (Metadata Spreadsheet for Sky \nPIN 28A508) & GX140 (Metadata Spreadsheet for Sky PIN 5UIPOT) .)  As the Government \nacknowledges, many of the C hat Spreadsheets contain duplicate and/or triplicate entries for a \nsingle message.  (Gov’t Reply at 9.)  The Government states that the reason for the duplication is \n“unknown,” but speculates that it “may be an artifact of the capture or decryption process.”   (Id.)  \nThe Government also notes that many of the Chat Spreadsheets reflect one -sided or incomplete  \nconversations  because certain messages were either not intercepted or “have not yet been . . . \ndecrypted.”  ( Id. at 10.)  \nIn addition to seeking admission of the Chat Spreadsheets, t he Government’s proposed trial \nexhibits  also include PDF files , each  of which  displays  the information contained in the first few \ncolumns of  a Chat Spreadsheet , formatted to appear as  text messages appear on a cell phone—\nchronologically with the contents of each message in a colored “bubble” below a timestamp.   (See \nGov’t Reply at 12 (describing exhibit format); see, e.g., GX 116.)   Where the chat contains a \nreference to a media file, the corresponding image is inserted to appear as a message.  ( See Gov’t Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 4 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n Reply at 12.)   Duplicate messages are removed and messages written in Spanish are accompanied \nby an English translation that appears in red font below the original text.3  (Id.; see,  e.g., GX 116 -\nT.)  In total, the Government’s Exhibit list includes PDF versions of 41 complete Chat \nSpreadsheets and 131 excerpts thereof .  (10/14/25 Ex. List at 3–8.) \nB. French Certification Documents   \nAlong with proposed excerpts of the  Sky Evidence, the Government has also marked as \nexhibits two additional documents that accompanied the transmissions from France .   \nFirst, the Government has provided an English translation of the P rocès -Verbal  that \naccompanied the transmission of the Sky Evidence from France.  (See Gov’t Reply at 2; GX159 -\nC-T.)  The Procès -Verbal  is dated July 12, 2024 and states that information associated with the \ntwo Sky PINs is “contained in [a] database” and would be “compil[ed]  . . using the interface of \nthe Dutch collaborators to the join t investigation team.”  ( Id.)     \nSecond, the Government has provided a  “Certificate of Authenticity ,” dated August 25, \n2025, that purports to “establish that [the Sky Evidence] is self -authenticating pursuant to the \nFederal Rules of Evidence.”  (Gov’t Suppl. Letter at 2; see  GX158 -C.)  The Certificate of \nAuthenticity appears to be signed by a French law enforcement officer and attests, inter  alia, that \nthe Sky Evidence was “collected by copying the requested information concerning the two \nspecified SkyECC identifiers via the electronic storage medium that maintains the SkyECC data \ncollected as part of the SkyECC data collected as part of the SkyECC investigation, and which is \nkept and maintained by law enforcement authorities[.]”  (Id.)  The Certificate further states that \nthe Sky Evidence consists of “duplicates of original records as captured by European law \n \n3 The Government also provides certifications for English translations.  ( See, e.g. , 165-C.)  Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 5 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n enforcement authorities in the joint investigation of SkyECC”  and was “generated by an electronic \nprocess or system that produces an accurate result.”  ( Id.) \nC. Related  Evidence & Testimony   \nIn its briefing, the Government has  repeatedly  referred  to the MLAT request and the \nEuropean joint “law enforcement operation ” through which data from the Sky servers was obtained \nand stored in a “database .”  (See Gov’t MIL at 4, 10 n.6; Gov’t Resp. at 3– 4, 19 n.5.)  However, \naside from the Procès -Verbal , Certificate of Authenticity,  and the aforementioned reference to an \n“iterative” decryption  process , (Gov’t Reply at 10), the Government has not made any \nrepresentations or proffered any evidence that sheds light on how the Sky Evidence was seized , \ndecrypted, or compiled .  After reviewing the parties ’ initial motions in limine , I ordered the \nGovernment to file a reply brief clarifying , inter alia, whether the Government intends to offer any \nadditional evidence or elicit testimony related to the seizure, decryption, compilation and/or \nextraction of the Sky Evidence.  (See Aug. 12, 2025 Order, ECF No. 112.)  The Government \nindicated that it does not intend to offer  such evidence or elicit such testimony on the view that it \nis not necessary for authentication and not relevant to any issue at trial. (Gov’t Reply at 10 –11.)  \nThe Government also indicated that the European governments that were “directly involved” in \nthe seizure and  decryption operations “will not make witnesses available.”  ( See id. 11 n.10.)  \nDefendant, by contrast, has made extensive representations about the process by which the \nSky Evidence was intercepted, decrypted, and shared with law enforcement in other countries .  \n(See Decl. Joseph Corozzo & Lipsman (“Corozzo Decl.”), ECF No. 94- 1, ¶¶ 23–169.)   Defendant \nasserts, inter alia, that European law enforcement obtained judicial authorization to intercept all \ncommunications on the Sky platform for two  multi- month periods  between June 2019 and March \n2021.  ( Id. ¶ 52–58.)  Defendant further asserts that European officers used multiple software Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 6 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n programs and/or artificial intelligence tools  to decrypt, organize, and analyze the  intercepted data, \nincluding a program called “Chat -X” that rendered the messages “readable and searchable.”   (Id. \n¶¶ 61 –62, 101, 106, 108.)  Defendant has also filed reports  and letters  from three purported experts \nopining on the provenance, format , and reliability of the Sky Evidence.  ( See Def.’s MIL Exs. A, \nB, D, I, M  & N.)  Defendant’s experts assert, inter  alia, that the Sky Evidence is not the “raw” or \n“original” data that was intercepted from France, that artificial intelligence was likely used to \ncreate the C hat Spreadsheets , and that metadata reveals  the Sky Evidence was  modified multiple \ntimes  before it was produced to Defendant.  ( Corozzo Decl.  ¶¶ 110 –12, 135–36, 160.)  Defendant \nhas noticed the Government that he plans to call each of those experts to testify about the \nunreliability of the Sky evidence at trial.  (Gov’t MIL at 7–8; see Def.’s Resp. at 5; 28–32; id. Ex. \nB, ECF No. 106-4 (Def.’s Expert Witness Disclosure).) \nD. Motions in Limine  \nBoth parties have filed in  limine  motions concerning the Sky Evidence and the scope of \npermissible testimony related thereto. 4   \nThe Government moves in limine  to admit excerpts from the Sky Evidence on the grounds  \nthat they show communications relevant to the charged conduct and can be authenticated through \na combination of witness testimony, the French certification documents , and its distinctive \ncontents and/or characteristics .  (Gov’t MIL at 8–13.)   The Government also moves to (1) preclude \nthe Defendant from arguing, commenting, or eliciting testimony about the legality of the operation \nthrough which the Sky Evidence was obtained ( id. at 25 –26); and (2) preclude  certain  testimony \n \n4 The parties filed their initial motions in  limine  on June 13, 2025 and their responses on July 21, 2025.  (ECF No. 94, \n96, 105, 107.)  In response to my orders , the Government filed a reply brief on August 21, 2025  (ECF No. 118) and a \nSupplemental Letter on October 22, 2025 (ECF No. 148) .  On September 15 and September 17 2025, Defendant filed \ntwo supplemental letters in further support of its motions in  limine .  (ECF Nos. 125 & 129).   The Government filed a \nresponse to those letters on September 26, 2025 (ECF No. 131).   Because these various submissions  concern similar \nand/or overlapping issues, I refer to the parties “motions in  limine ” collectively, drawing on the arguments and \nrepresentations set forth in all the different filings.    Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 7 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n about the Sky Evidence from the Defendant’s putative experts  on the grounds that they either lack \nthe requisite qualifications or the proposed testimony is not relevant  (id. at 2 9–31).   \nDefendant moves  in limine  to preclude  admission  of the Sky Evidence  on five distinct \ngrounds.  First, Defendant argues that the spreadsheets transmitted from France are “summaries to \nprove content” that cannot be admitted without making the underlying data available to the \ndefense.  (Def.’s MIL at 1 –5; see Fed. R. Evid. 1006.)   Second, Defendant argues the files cannot \nbe authenticated in the manner proposed by the Government because it does not establish to the \nrequisite degree of certainty how the spreadsheets were created .  (Def.’s MIL at 9 –17; Def.’s Resp . \nto Gov’t MIL (“Def.’s Resp .”), ECF No. 105, at 3–16; see also Def.’s  Suppl. Letter in Supp. of \nMIL (“Def.’s Sur- Reply”) , ECF No. 125, at 11–15 (arguing that the recently produced certification \ncannot be used to authenticate the Sky Evidence).)  Third, Defendant argues that the admission of \none-sided or incomplete conversations would violate Federal Rule of Evidence 106.  (Def.’s MIL \nat 18 –19.)  Fourth, Defendant argues that , without allowing him to examine the “underlying data,”  \nthe probative value of the Sky Evidence would be substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair \nprejudice .  (Id. at 17 –18.)   Fifth, Defendant argues much of the Sky Evidence —including many of \nthe Government’s proposed exhibits —is not relevant to any fact of consequence  because the \ncommunications  postdate the charged conduct  and otherwise should be excluded as other acts \nevidence pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) .  (See Def.’s Suppl. MIL , 3–8.)   Defendant \nalso renews his argument that the Sky Evidence should be suppressed as the product of unlawful \nmass surveillance and, separately, that admi tting the spreadsheets without calling the individual \nwho prepared them would violate the Confrontation Clause.  (Def.’s MIL at 22, Def.’s Resp. at 2 .) \n \n Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 8 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n II. LEGAL STANDARD  \n“The purpose of a motion in limine  is to allow the trial court to rule in advance of trial on \nthe admissibility and relevance of certain forecasted evidence.”  United States v. Brown, 606 F. \nSupp. 2d 306, 311 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) .  “Evidence should be excluded on a motion in  limine  only \nwhen the evidence is clearly inadmissible on all potential grounds.”  United States v. Morel , 751 \nF. Supp. 2d 423, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) .  A district court’s “ruling regarding a motion in  limine  is \n“subject to change when the case unfolds, particularly if the actual testimony differs from what \nwas contained in the movant’s proffer.”  United States v. Ozsusamlar , 428 F. Supp. 2d 161, 165 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (alteration adopted) (quoting Luce v. United States , 469 U.S. 38, 41 (1984)).  \nUnder the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence is generally admissible if it is relevant, \nwhich means it “has any tendency to make a consequential fact more or less probable that it other \nwise would be.” United States v. Terranova, 750 F. Supp. 3d 15, 29–30 (E.D.N.Y. 2024)  \n(discussing Fed. R. Evid. 401 & 402).  However, a court “may exclude relevant evidence if its \nprobative value is ‘substantially outweighed’ by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, \nmisleading the jury, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.”  Id. (quoting \nFed. R. Evid. 403) .   \nAll evidence other than live testimony must also be authenticated prior to being admitted.   \nSee Fed. R. Evid. 901(a).  “The requirement of authentication is a condition precedent to admitting \nevidence,” United States v. Vayner , 769 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2014), which means that the court \nmust make a preliminary determination about whether the proponent has introduced sufficient \nproof that a reasonable juror could find that the evidence is what the proponent claims it to be.  \nUnited States v. Tin Yat Chin , 371 F.3d 31, 37–38 (2d Cir. 2004) ; see Fed. R. Evid. 104(a) (“The \nCourt must decide any preliminary question about whether . . . evidence is admissible.”) .

Hunt , 534 F. Supp. 3d 233, 253  \n(E.D.N.Y. 2021) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 902).  For evidence that is not self -authenticating, Rule \n901 sets forth a non -exhaustive list of corroborating evidence that may be offered to support \nauthentication, including:  \n(1) Testimony of a Witness with Knowledge.  Testimony that an item is what it is \nclaimed to be.  \n \n**** \n \n(4) Distinctive Characteristics and the Like. The appearance, contents, substance, \ninternal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with \nall the circumstances.  \n \n***** \n \n(9) Evidence About a Process or System .  Evidence describing a process or system \nand showing that it produces an accurate result. \n \nFed. R. Evid. 901(b)(1), (4), (9) .   \nRule 901 “does not definitively establish the nature or quantum of proof that is required.”  \nVayner , 769 F.3d at 133 (quoting United States v. Sliker , 751 F.2d 477, (2d Cir. 1984)).   The \nSecond Circuit has explained that Rule 901 “does not erect a particularly high hurdle, and that \nhurdle may be cleared by circumstantial evidence.”  United States v. Gonzalez, 144 F.4th 396, 406 \n(2d Cir. 2025)  (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Once the court concludes that a piece of \nevidence has been authenticated, “ the opposing party remains free to challenge the reliability of \nthe evidence, to minimize its importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its meaning, but \nthese and similar other challenges go to the weight, not the admissibility, of the evidence.   \nGonzalez, 144 F.4th at  406.  The “ultimate determination as to whether the evidence is, in fact, \nwhat its proponent claims is . . . a matter for the jury.”  Vayner , 769 F.3d at 130.   Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 10 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 \n III. DISCUSSION  \nA. Renewed Motion to Suppress and/or Exclude the Sky Evidence \nDefendant moves to preclude the Sky Evidence as the fruits of “suspicionless mass \nsurveillance” and, relatedly, to renew his motion to suppress the Sky Evidence on the grounds that \nthe U.S. officers were sufficiently involved in the surveillance that the F ourth Amendment applies.  \n(Def.’s MIL at 22 –24.)  Judge Ross previously denied Defendant’s motion to suppress and/or \npreclude the Sky Evidence on the same grounds.  ( See January 2025 Op. at 9–10 (concluding that \nthe Fourth Amendment was not applicable); id. at 12 (declining to exercise inherent “supervisory \npowers” to exclude Sky Evidence).)  Because Defendant has not identified a sound basis for \nrevisiting Judge Ross’s conclusions, that  motion is denied.  \nAfter a suppression motion has been decided on the merits, “[r]econsideration is generally \nappropriate only ‘if there has been an intervening change in controlling law, there is new evidence, \nor a need is shown to correct a clear error of law or to prevent  manifest injustice.’”  United States \nv. Tisdol , 450 F. Supp. 2d 191, 194 (D. Conn. 2006)  (quoting United States v. Sanchez, 35 F.3d \n673, 677 (2d Cir.1994)).  “[T]he standard for reopening a suppression hearing based on new \nevidence is as stringent as the standard for reconsideration.”  United States v. Almonte , 14-CR-86, \n2014 WL 3702598, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 24, 2014); see also  United States v. Lucas , 379 F. Supp. \n3d 182, 188–89 (W.D.N.Y. 2019) (collecting cases).   \nHere, Defendant argues that reconsideration is warranted based on three pieces of “newly \navailable evidence” related to the intelligence operation through which the Sky Evidence was \ncollected.  The first is the trial testimony of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) agent  \nnamed Jason Willock , who testified  in a different federal case about the European joint \ninvestigation and the various ways that European law enforcement supported European Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 11 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n investigators.  (Def.’s MIL at 20 –21; id., Exs. AA & BB, ECF Nos. 94- 29 & 94- 30 (excerpts of \ntrial transcript from United States v. Didani , No. 21- 20264 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 25–26, 2025)).  The \nsecond  piece of new evidence is a purported “deployment plan” written by Dutch law enforcement \nthat details aspects of the European joint investigation, including the use the Chat -X software \nprogram to process the intercepted data. (Def.’s MIL, Ex. J, ECF No. 94- 12; see also Ex. I, ECF \nNo. 94- 11 (letter describing document as “a formal plan, drafted by the Amsterdam police and \nsubmitted to the French investigating judge ” prior to carrying out the investigation).)  The third is \na report dated August 19, 2019 and purportedly written by French law enforcement that describes \nthe joint intelligence operation.  (Def.’s MIL, Ex. K, ECF No. 94- 13.)  \nAs a threshold matter, I note that the latter two documents, which were provided by \nDefendant’s putative expert, Yehudi Moszkowicz, both appear to predate Defendant’s original \nsuppression motion.  Defendant has not indicated whether and why either should be considered \n“newly discovered evidence” that could not have previously been discovered through due \ndiligence.  See United States v. Perez, No. 01 -CR-848, 2002 WL 1835601, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. \n8, 2002).  Moreover, even assuming the se documents were previously unknown and \nundiscoverable and Defendant could meet the procedural requirements for reconsideration, this \nCourt would, after considering those documents, still deny Defendant’s suppression motion on the \nmerits.   \nIn deciding Defendant’s  previous motion, Judge Ross assumed Defendant’s factual \nassertions about the European joint investigation, including his assertion  that U.S. law enforcement \ntook certain steps to support the investigation, were  true.  ( See Jan. 2025 Op. at 8, 10.)  She \nnonetheless concluded that the Fourth Amendment was inapplicable since  Defendant had no prior \nconnection to the United States and “successful coordin[ation]” with foreign law enforcement is Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 12 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>13 \n not enough to trigger the extraterritorial application of the exclusionary rule.  ( Id. at 11 (quoting \nUnited States v. Getto , 729 F.3d 221, 233 (2d Cir. 2013)).  Judge Ross also declined to exclude \nthe Sky Evidence on the grounds that it was obtained in a manner that “shocks the conscience ,” \nknowing full well the scale of the surveillance operation alleged by Defendant.  ( Id.; see also  id. \nat 5 (stating that operation intercepted an estimated 1 billion messages).)   \nDefendant ’s newly proffered  evidence adds little to the analysis.  At most, it establishes \nthat U.S. law enforcement assisted the Europeans by: (1) helping to identify the location of the \nSky ECC servers by communicating with U.S. companies ; and (2) agreeing to delay certain arrests \nso as not to interfere with the investigation.  ( See Def.’s MIL Exs. AA at 27; Ex. BB at 33.)  \nNothing in Agent Willock’s  testimony or  the documents sent by Defendant’s experts suggests that \nthe United States was actually the leader of the investigation or relied on foreign law enforcement \nwith the “intent to evade American constitutional requirements.”  Getto , 729 F.3d at 232.  Because \nDefendant ’s newly proffered evidence is largely cumulative  and does not establish that \nsuppression, or even a hearing, is warranted here , Defendant’s motion to renew his prior motion \nis DENIED.  \nB. Authentication  of the Sky Evidence  \nThe Government moves to admit excerpts from the Sky Evidence, which it claims to be a \nreliable log of “communications by and among the defendant and other co -conspirators that were \ntransmitted over the Sky network.”  (Gov’t MIL at 8.)  The Government proposes to authenticat e \nthe Sky Evidence  as such through some combination of the following:   First, the Government will \ncall multiple cooperating witnesses who will testify from firsthand knowledge that Defendant \ncommunicated over  the Sky network using the accounts associated with Sky PINs 28A508 and \n5UIP0T.  ( Id. at 11.)   Through those witnesses, the Government will introduce evidence of Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 13 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>14 \n communications with accounts 28A508 and 5UIP0T that were captured directly from the \nwitnesses’ phones .  (Gov’t Reply at 3.)   Second, the Government will call a law enforcement \nwitness who will testify from firsthand knowledge  that the Sky Evidence was transmitted  to the \nGovernment electronically from France in response to a request for data for the same two accounts.   \n(Gov’t MIL at 11; see Gov’t Reply at 5 n.6).  Finally, the Government will highlight specific \nfeatures of the Sky Evidence that provide circumstantial corroboration that the Chat Spreadsheets \nare accurate logs of  the Defendant’s  communications over the Sky network.  (Gov’t MIL at 11–\n12.)  Specifically, the Government will show that some  messages  independently obtained from the \ncooperating witnesses also appear in the Chat Spreadsheets .  (See Corozzo Decl. ¶ 142; see also  \nGov’t Reply at 3 n.3 (explaining that the “messages recorded directly from cooperating witness \nSky phones are not all  replicated within the Sky Evidence received from France ” (emphasis \nadded)).)   The Government will also highlight , inter alia, messages  that referenc e travel plans \ncorresponding to the Defendant’s travel records, a reference to a birthday dinner that occurred on \nthe Defendant’s birthday, and various images —including selfies —that correspond to images \nobtained from a different  cell phone  that was seized  directly  from Defendant at the time o f his \narrest .  (Id. at 12.)   This evidence would purportedly establish that PINs 28A508 and 5UIP0T  \nbelonged to Defendant.   \nIn addition to witness testimony and Sky Evidence excerpts  that the Government intends \nto introduce at trial, the Government contends that , in resolving the preliminary question of \nauthenticity,  I may also consider the Procès -Verbal  and the Certificate of Authenticity , though it \nis unclear whether the Government intends to put those documents  before the jury.  (See Gov’t \nReply at 4 n.4; Gov’t Suppl. Letter Resp. (“Gov’t Suppl. Resp.”), ECF No. 131, at 4.)   Relatedly, \nthe Government argues that, in resolving the authentication issue , the Court can consider the Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 14 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>15 \n numerous concessions in Defendant’ s filing with this Court about the European law enforcement \noperation into Sky and the fact that Sky messages were intercepted and decrypted as part of that \noperation.5  (Id. at 3.)  A s noted earlier, the Government does not intend to call  witnesses who \nwere personally  involved in the alleged seizure and  decryption of the Sky Evidence or the \ntransmission of that evidence to the DOJ.  \nDefendant argues that the Government cannot authenticate the Sky Evidence  in the manner \nproposed because , inter alia, the Government’s witnesses do not have personal knowledge about \nthe underlying investigation  and/or compilation of the Chat Spreadsheets, and  the Sky Evidence \nis not “properly certified.”  (Def.’s Resp. at 3 –7; Def.’s Sur- Reply  at 11 –15.) \nAt the outset, I note that the ambiguity surrounding the underlying European intelligence \noperation presents a unique challenge for the purpose of authentication.  Contrary to the \ngovernment’s assertion, the Sky Evidence is not “broadly like  the kinds of communications data \nthat the government routinely receives from telecommunications and social media companies . . . \n[,] which federal courts routinely admit into evidence at trial.”  (Gov’t MIL at 5.)   Such records  \nare ordinarily obtained directly from the company, accompanied by a certification and/or witness \ntestimony detailing  the company’s recordkeeping practices  and business purpose .  See,  e.g., United \nStates v. El Gammal, 831 F. App’ x 539, 543–44 (2d Cir. 2020)  (describing foundation testimony \nof Facebook records custodian) ; United States v. Hunt, 534 F. Supp. 3d 233, 254 (E.D.N.Y. 2021)  \n(indicating that records custodian from social media platform could attest to the accuracy of  \ncertain aspects of communications exchanged over that platform, including a confirmation that the \n \n5 While the Government contends that the Court can consider these admissions by Defendant  in determining the \nauthenticity of the Sky Evidence , the Government has not indicated that it would actually seek to admit any of these  \nstatements by defense counsel  at trial. \n \n Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 15 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>16 \n depicted communications took place between certain social media accounts, on particular dates, \nor at particular times).  The  attestation  of a qualified  records custodian  serves as a reliable indicium \nthat the record s in question reflect “accounts, communications, location data, etc., that were not \n‘subject to manipulation or inadvertent distortion.’”  United States v. Abdullah , No. 20 CR. 677, \n2024 WL 4519860, at *2  (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 16, 2024)  (quoting United States v. Browne , 834 F.3d \n403, 414 (3d Cir. 2016)).  Here, by contrast, the Government  has supplied virtually no substantive \ninformation —and certainly none from a qualified custodian—about the technical method by which \nthe Sky Evidence was collected , decrypted or compiled .  For these reasons, the Sky Evidence is \nsimply not analogous to ordinary business records. \nThe Sky Evidence also differs in critical respects from  a forensic copy or “extraction”  taken \ndirectly from a defendant’s device  or account .  See, e.g., United States v. Jean -Claude, No. 18 -\nCR-601, 2022 WL 2334509, at *16 (S.D.N.Y. June 27, 2022)  (describing functionality of \nCellebrite  extraction  software), aff’d sub nom. United States v. Gonzalez, 144 F.4th 396 (2d Cir. \n2025) .  Because the probative value of such evidence “depends on the validity of the underlying \nmethod” or technology, Rule 901 generally require s the proponent to offer some further evidence, \nwhether in the form of witness testimony or affidavit , “‘describing’ the process . . . and ‘showing \nthat it produces an accurate result.’”  4 Mueller & Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence  § 9:20 (quoting \nFed. R. Evid. 901(b)(9) ; see United States v. Carter , No. 21- CR-681, 2024 WL 268248, at *3  \n(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 24, 2024)  (describing affidavit detailing collection and decryption of data from \niCloud accounts  through propriety Apple software ).  In many cases, the technology used to make \nforensic copies is familiar to law enforcement witnesses who can credibly testify to the \nfunctionality and reliability of the relevant “forensic tool” and the likelihood that the resulting data \n“ha[s] been altered or manipulated.”   Gonzalez, 114 F.4th at 25.  Some electronic copies may  even Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 16 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>17 \n be self-authenticating under Federal Rules of Evidence 902(13) or 902(14).  See United States v. \nPalmer , No. 24- CR-67, 2025 WL 2978633, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 21, 2025)  (admitting certain \nemail and phone records  as self-authenticating) .   \nHere, by contrast, the Government’s only evidence describing the process by which the \nSky Evidence was created  is the Certificate of Authenticity that states, generically  and in \nconclusory fashion, that the  files were copied from an “electronic storage medium” that contains \ndata and original records that were “collected ” and “captured” by European law enforcement \nauthorities in their investigation of SkyECC.  (GX158 -C.)  The Government does not intend to \nelicit any additional testimony about the contents of that storage medium and disavows having \ntechnical knowledge of the underlying “capture or decryption process[es].”  ( See Gov’t Reply at \n9–11.)  Standing alone , the Certificate of Authenticity merely supports the contention that that the \nSky Evidence reflects an extraction of certain information maintained electronically in a European  \n“electronic storage medium”; it d oes nothing to establish the origins or reliability of that \ninformation.  Further, there are several features of the Sky Evidence that differentiate the Chat \nSpreadsheets from message logs  that have been  forensically extracted  through well -established \nmeans , such as the frequent appearance of duplicate and triplicate messages and the Chat \nSpreadsheet  columns titled “language,” “ingest_date,” and “new since [date] .”  (See id. at 10 .)   \nThese latter features suggest  that the Sky Evidence has been subjected to a degree of post -seizure \nprocessing that would not be expected in, say, a Cellebrite extraction.  \nThe fact that the Sky Evidence was purportedly collected by law enforcement and sent \npursuant to an MLAT request is, even in light of all the other circumstantial evidence cited by the \nGovernment, insufficient.  Notably, other cases admitting evidence from  foreign governments \ninvolved more substantial evidence in support of the Government’s authentication argument.  See, Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 17 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>29 \n notice regarding Mr. Koch’s expected testimony refers to a single page “report” indicating that he \nhas reviewed Sky Evidence and “agree[s] on all points” with the  report of Mr. Milch  and states \nthat the Sky Evidence “should be suppressed” because it is “incomplete, open to manipulation, \nunverifiable to an original dataset . . . contains multiple errors, contains multiple omissions, [was] \ncollected and processed by unknown and unverified tools, and lacks timestamps or GPS data .”  \n(Id.)  At outset, I note that the primary opinion set forth in the letter is a legal conclusion—namely \nthat the Sky Evidence “should be suppressed” —that would not constitute relevant or permissible \ntestimony at trial.   See United States v. Bilzerian , 926 F.2d 1285, 1294 (2d Cir. 1991) ( “[A]n expert \n. . . may not give testimony stating ultimate legal conclusions [.]”).  In any case, even if Defendant \ncould elicit Mr. Koch’s testimony for a proper purpose , the expert notice does not set forth the  \n“bases and reasons” for Mr. Koch’s conclusions .  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C)(iii) (“The \ndisclosure for each expert witness must contain . . . the bases and reasons for [all opinions that the \ndefendant will elicit from the witness[.]”).   The sparseness of the expert disclosure for Mr. Koch \n“not only dooms [the] notice  under Rule 16, but also fails to provide the Court with enough \ninformation to conduct a rigorous examination’  of the [Mr. Koch’s] methodology, as required by \nits gatekeeping function under Daubert .”  United States v. Kwok, No. 23- CR-118, 2024 WL \n1773143, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2024)  (quoting Amorgianos v. Nat ’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 303 \nF.3d 256, 267 (2d Cir. 2002) ).  Therefore, Mr. Koch is not certified as an expert and may not testify \nas such at trial.  \nFinally, I turn to Mr. Milch, a German criminal defense lawyer and “certified IT forensics \nspecialist.”  (Def.’s MIL Ex. C, ECF No. 95- 5.)  Mr. Milch has reviewed the Sky Evidence and \ndrafted two lengthy reports evaluating the reliability of the data and highlighting various \n“anomalies” in the Chat Spreadsheet s.  (Def.’s MIL Ex. A, ECF No. 95- 3 (the “Milch Report”); Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 29 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>30 \n Def.’s MIL Ex. B, ECF No. 95- 5 (the “Milch Suppl. Report”); see also  MIL Ex. Def.’s Ex. P, ECF \nNo. 94- 18.)  Those reports address a wide range of topics related to the Sky Evidence including, \ninter alia, the functionality and format of the encryption used on the Sky network (Milch Report \n4–12); the European “hack” operation ( id. at 13 –16); and various features of the Chat Spreadsheets \nand Media Folders ( id. at 17 –44; Milch Suppl. Report at 3–17).  Mr. Milch’s conclusion is that the \n“integrity” of the Sky Evidence cannot be verified due to the format in which it was transmitted.  \n(Milch Report  at 58.)  To start , for reasons I have previously explained, the integrity of the Sky \nEvidence is relevant  to issue s at trial, as it bears on the reliability of the Government’s evidence of \nthe conspiracy.  I also find that Mr. Milch is qualified to opine on the format and reliability of the \nSky Evidence based on his certification as an IT forensics specialist and exper ience litigating \nmultiple cases involving similar evidence.7  (See ECF No. 94- 5)  “ Federal Rule 702 does not \nrequire that an expert attend a specific type or number of trainings for a specific length of time, \nand the Second Circuit has advised that ‘ [t]he words qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, \nexperience, training, or education’ must be read in light of the liberalizing purpose of [Rule 702].’”  \nUnited States v. Ramsey , No. 21- CR-495, 2023 WL 2523193 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2023), aff’d, \n2024 WL 5199288 (2d Cir. Dec. 23, 2024)  (quoting United States v. Brown, 776 F.2d 397, 400 \n(2d Cir. 1985)).  I also find that some (but not all)  of Mr. Milch’s analysis is based on sufficient \nfacts and sound methods —namely  the close review of the Chat Spreadsheets and  associated Media \nFolders.  His speculation about the tools and methods of European law enforcement, by contrast, \ndo not rest on a sufficient foundation.  Finally, I conclude that Mr. Milch’s explication and analysis \nof certain topics  would be helpful to the jury, who are likely to be unfamiliar with topics such as \nencryption, metadata digital forensic standards that bear on the reliability of the Sky Evidence .  \n \n7 Mr. Milch is not, however, qualified as an expert in the tactics of European law enforcement and lacks personal \nknowledge to testify about the investigation.  Case 1:22-cr-00493-JMA     Document 160     Filed 10/31/25     Page 30 of 33 PageID #:\n<pageID>31 \n Accordingly, I will permit Mr. Milch to testify as an expert on the following limited list of  topics  \nset forth in his reports:  \n• The functionality and format of Microsoft Excel ; \n• the format and content of the Chat Spreadsheets , including metadata ; and  \n• general d igital forensic standards and methods . \nIn addition to the general limitations on irrelevant testimony set forth above, I will not  permit Mr . \nMilch  to testify on the following topics addressed in his reports , he lacks any  personal or  \nspecialized knowledge about them :  \n• The method by which European law enforcement captured , stored, analyzed, or \ndecrypted  communications from the Sky network;  \n• the use of artificial intelligence ; \n• the existence or availability of other  “versions” of the Sky Evidence or related \ndatasets  (such as geolocation data) that Mr. Milch has not personally reviewed;  \n• statements made by other tribunals or government entities  about the reliability of \nevidence obtained from the Sky network.  \nFurther, Mr. Milch will likely be required to confine his analysis to those exhibits of the Sky \nEvidence I have deemed admissible and to not discuss any other files that were transmitted from \nFrance.   \n Finally, in light of the scope of permissible testimony I have outlined above, the \nGovernment is  instructed to ensure it has produced to the Defendant any materials in its possession \nthat reveal  the way(s) the Sky Evidence was seized, decrypted,  or transmitted , including the MLAT \nrequest (s) that elicited the transmission of the Sky Evidence from France.  Such materials are \n“relevant and vital to the defense, if they are to mount an attack on the [Sky Evidence] at trial ” and \ntherefore fall within the purview of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16.  United States v. Juan \nVincent Gomez Castrillon , No. 05-  CR-156, 2007 WL 2398810, at *5 (S.D.N.Y.

Pro. 16(a)(1)(e)(i) (listing “item[s] “material to preparing the defense” as \ninformation subject to disclosure at the defendant’s request).  If the Government maintains that \nany information should be redacted from the MLAT requests  or any other discovery set out above , \nthe Government shall identify that information and its reasons for requesting redaction in a sealed \nand ex parte filing. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein:  \n- Defendant’s motion in  limine  to renew his motion to suppress and/or preclude the Sky \nEvidence is DENIED;  \n - the Government’s motion in limine  to admit the Sky Evidence is preliminarily \nGRANTED with respect to  exhibits that can be authenticated by witness testimony as set \nforth above, and DENIED as to all other exhibits ;  \n- Defendant’s various motions in  limine  to preclude some or all of  the Sky Evidence  under \nFRE 1006, 106, 401, 403 and  404(b) are DENIED ; \n- Defendant’s motion in limine  to condition the admission of the Sky Evidence on the \navailability of live testimony from an individual who prepared the exhibits is  DENIED;  \n- the Government’s motion in  limine  to preclude testimony about the legality of the \nEuropean investigation is GRANTED;  \n- the Government’s motion in  limine  to preclude expert testimony is GRANTED as to Mr. \nMoszkowicz and Mr. Koc h and DENIED as to Mr. Milch, subject to the limitations set \nforth  above.  \nPursuant to Rule 16, t he Government is ordered to produce  to Defendant the Rule 16 materials \ndescribed above .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case in the Northern District of California involves the plaintiffs, Abdul Nevarez et al., and the defendants, Forty Niners Football Company, LLC et al., concerning electronic discovery (ESI) production issues. The defendants employed predictive artificial intelligence to filter non-responsive documents from approximately 297,000 documents identified by search terms, but struggled to determine a viable cut-off for non-production due to incomplete program data. The court ordered the defendants to complete the ESI production by a set deadline and submit an affidavit of completion, emphasizing the importance of the agreed safeguards to prevent misuse of any potentially privileged documents.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants should be allowed to determine a cutoff point for unreviewed document production using predictive AI, in order to avoid producing non-responsive or privileged information without a complete review, given their limited AI data support.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court did not allow the defendants to arbitrarily adopt a cut-off point for document production without sufficient support from their AI tools.

Nos. 238, 241  \n \n \nPursuant to  the Court’s October 10, 2018 Order granting Plaintiffs’ motion to compel a \ndate certain for Defendants’ ESI production  (ECF 241) , on October 15, 2018, the Parties appeared \nbefore the Court for a status conference on Defendants’ ESI production efforts.   \nFirst, the Court was pleased to note that the Parties have engaged in robust meet and confer \nefforts to enable Defendants to meet the ESI production deadlines of October 19, 2018.  As noted \nat the hearing, efforts to facilitate the productive of responsive documents, while alway s a \nchallenge with ESI, promote  litigation and judicial efficiency and therefore benefits all parties.  \nThe Court expects the Parties to continue these efforts until the production is complete.  \nSecond, Defenda nts expressed concerns regarding the approximately 297,000 documents \ncurrently identified by search terms but as yet unreviewed, particularly with certain search terms \ncontinuing to return some percentage of non -responsive documents.  Defendants expressed \nparticular con cern for non-responsive documents that may contain privileged information or raise \nthird -party privacy concerns that may be produced absent r eview of the documents in advance of \nproduction.   This dilemma is not uncommon in ESI productions.  Defendants hav e, \nconstructively, adopted the use of predictive artificial intelligence programs to assist in the \nidentification of non-responsive documents en masse within the unreviewed documents.  Case 4:16-cv-07013-HSG     Document 254     Filed 10/16/18     Page 1 of 2 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  However, Defendants do not have sufficient data from those programs to argue for a supportable \n“cut-off” point among the unreviewed documents to avoid produc ing, and thus reviewing, some \nportion of the 297,000 documents.  Given that the Parties are already well past the close of \ndiscovery, there is not time to develop such an  argument, and the Court will not permit Defendants \nto adopt such a cut -off point arbitrarily.  Fortunately, the Parties have other safeguards in place to \nprevent the mis -use of produced documents that contain the agreed upon search terms  but are \neither un responsive, privileged or otherwise protected,  such as the Protective Order (ECF 97) and \nFederal Rule of Evidence 502(b) protections against inadvertent disclosures , which the Parties \nhave agreed will apply under these circumstances.    \nThe Parties may, at  Defendants discretion, continue to meet and confer regarding the use of \npredictive coding as a means of identifying documents that are unlikely to be responsive and thus \ndo not need to be produced in this action.  However, absent any agreement on such ide ntification, \nDefendants’ entire ESI production, whether or not Defendant s have  been able to review all of the \ndocuments in advance of production, must be turned over to Plaintiffs by 5 :00 p.m. on Friday, \nOctober 19, 2018, as previously ordered by the Court .  See ECF 241.  \nThe Court further ORDERS  that Defendants submit an affidavit  on October 19, 2018 , \nexecuted by counsel under penalty of perjury, that the ESI production has been completed.  If the \naffidavit is not provided, counsel for Plaintiffs and Defend ants are ORDERED  to appear before \nthis Court on Monday, October 22, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. for assessment of sanctions pursuant to  this \nCourt’s October 10, 2018 O rder.   \nSO ORDERED.  \n \nDated:  October 16, 2018  \n \n  \nSUSAN VAN KEULEN  \nUnited States Magistrate Judge  \nCase 4:16-cv-07013-HSG     Document 254     Filed 10/16/18     Page 2 of 2",

Because we conclude that this appeal \nlacks arguable merit, we will dismiss it pursuant to §  1915(e)(2)(B)(i).  \nJohnson ’s complaint named Young Money as a defendant, identifying herself as a \nresident of Pennsylvania and Young Money as a resident of Texas, and asserting federal \ncourt diversity of citizenship jurisdiction under 28  U.S.C. §  1332.  Johnson alleged that \n“Baby E  from Young Money has been making music about me. Baby E and I used to date \nbefor  his identity change his police uncle helped with he fake his death and I being \nharassed and Nicki Minaj keeps using my work Baby  E (Victor Robinson) needs help  \nslaves to the label to harass me havi ng people jump me and follow me.”   (Complaint, ¶III \nStatement of Claim.)  As relief, Johnson stated, “I just want them to stop and let the truth \nbe told. Stop helping people fake deaths and stop the 2 girls they picked to be my actors \nusing artificial intelligence Kenneka Jenkins and BreeAunna Poindexter the industry is \ninvolved.”   (Id., ¶IV Relief.)1  Johnson also filed a motion for leave to proceed in forma \npauperis.  The District Court granted Johnson’s in forma pauperis motion.  By \nmemorandum opinion and separate order entered on May 16, 2018, the District Court \ndismissed the complaint sua sponte as fr ivolous under 28  U.S.C. §  1915(e)(2)(B)(i).  The \nDistrict Court further concluded that amendment of the complaint would be futile.  \nJohnson appeals.  \n                                              \n1 As an exhibit to the complaint, Johnson attached a letter and a certificate dated April 25, \n2018 , written on behalf of President Donald J. Trump , conce rning Johnson’s inclusion in \nthe Repu blican Presidential Honor Roll.  Case: 18-2330     Document: 003113115074     Page: 2      Date Filed: 12/20/2018 \n3 \n We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28  U.S.C. §  1291.  We exercise plenary \nreview over the District Court’s dismissal of Johnson’s complaint as frivolous.  See \nRoman v. Jeffes , 904  F.2d 192, 194 (3d Cir. 1990).  The District Court determined that \nJohnson’s claims and relief sought are based on a fantastic or delusional factual scenario , \nsee Neitzke v. Wi lliams , 490 U.S. 319, 327 -28 (1989) , concluding that the complaint was \nfrivolous within the mean ing of §  1915(e)(2)(B).  See Neitzke , 490 U.S. at 325 (a \ncomplaint is frivolous if it “lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact”).  We agree \nwith the Di strict Court’s assessment of the allegations contained in the complaint.  \nMoreover, while generally a plaintiff should be granted leave to cure the deficiencies of a \ncomplaint subject to dismissal, we agree with the District Court’s determination that such  \nallowance would have been futile in this case.  See Grayson v. Mayview State Hosp. , \n293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir. 2002).  \nFor the above reasons, we will we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28  U.S.C. \n§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(i).  \n Case: 18-2330     Document: 003113115074     Page: 3      Date Filed: 12/20/2018",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Kimberly D. Hancock's pro se complaint against the United States was dismissed by the District of Kansas for failing to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Hancock's complaint alluded to being forced into a government-run artificial intelligence program but did not present specific allegations against the defendant, nor did it articulate a valid cause of action. The case was recommended for dismissal due to a lack of actionable claims, with no evidence or proper legal basis established by the plaintiff.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Hancock’s complaint presented a legally sufficient claim against the United States, including any actionable allegations related to being coerced into a government-run artificial intelligence program.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court agreed with the recommendation to dismiss the complaint, ruling that it failed to articulate any claim against the United States or establish a plausible legal cause of action.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone named Kim tries to sue the government because she says they put her into some AI program against her will. However, when the court asked her to explain more specifically why she's suing and what legal rule was broken, she couldn't provide a clear answer connected to the government's actions. Because of this, the court decided there wasn’t enough reason to let the lawsuit continue, so they dismissed it.",

Severson recommendi ng dismissal of Plaintif f’s pro se complaint \nfor failure to state a claim upon which relief can be  granted.  (Doc. 8.)  Pl aintiff received the R&R \nthrough the court’s electronic fili ng system.  She had 14 days from receipt of the R&R to file \nwritten objections to it, and if sh e did not timely file any objecti ons, no court would allow appellate \nreview of the recommended dispos ition.  Plaintiff filed objections to the R&R with in the 14-day \nperiod.  (Doc. 9.)   \nHowever, Plaintiff failed to prop erly object to the R&R.   “T he Tenth Circuit requires that \nobjections to a magistrate judge's recommende d disposition ‘be both timely and specific to \npreserve an issue for de novo revi ew by the district court …’.” Williams v. United States , No. 19-\n2476-JAR-JPO, 2019 WL 6167514, at *1 (D. Kan. Nov. 20, 2019) (quoting United States v. One \nParcel of Real Prop. , 73 F.3d 1057, 1060 (10th Cir. 1996)).  Here, Plaintiff does not address \nMagistrate Judge Severson’s re commendations that her claim should be dismissed.  Rather, \nPlaintiff raises new concerns a bout her First Amendment rights, (D oc. 9 at 1), Fourth Amendment \nrights, ( id. at 1–2), Sixth Am endment rights, ( id. at 2), and Eighth Amendment rights, ( id.).  She Case 6:25-cv-01045-JWB     Document 10     Filed 05/30/25     Page 1 of 22 \n also quotes the Ninth and Tenth Amendment,  ( id.), and includes two new requests: “Motion To \nSever Platform B,” and “Motion To Di sclose the Procedure of Remedy.”  ( Id. at 3.)  Her requests \nare unclear and relate to the cl aim from her complaint about bei ng forced into a government run \nartificial intelligence program.  (Doc. 1 at 3–4.)  Magistra te Judge Severson recommended \ndismissal of Plaintiff’s claims because (1) she failed to assert any allegation against the United \nStates of America, the sole Defenda nt,  (Doc. 8 at 4), (2) Plaintiff fa iled to articulate any colorable \ncause of action, ( id. at 5), and (3) the statute of limitations likely bars Plaintiff’s 42 U.S.C. § 1983 \nclaim.  ( Id. at 6.)   Plaintiff made no attempt to specifically object to  these findings.   \nThe court has reviewed the R&R in conjuncti on with Plaintiff’s complaint and, and the \ncourt agrees that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim because her complaint fails to make any \nallegations against the United States, the sole de fendant named in this ac tion.  Furthermore, the \nbalance of her complaint fails to arti culate any colorable cause of action.1 \nConclusion \n \nBased on the foregoing, Plaintif f’s complaint (Doc. 1) is hereby DISMIS SED for failure to \nstate a claim upon which reli ef can be granted.   \n IT IS SO ORDERED.

BROOMES \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n  \n \n1 The R&R includes further analysis related to the magistrate judge’s assumption that Plaintiff may have been \nattempting to assert a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, incl uding the timeliness of such a claim with respect to the \ncontrolling statute of limitations.  The court does not rely on that portion of the R&R inasmuch as Section 1983 \naddresses violations of federal rights by persons acting under color of state law, and would not seem to apply to claims \nmade directly against the United States.

The Court finds that filing restri ctions are appropriate so  that the Court does not \nexpend valuable resources addressing future such filings and orders Plaintiff to show cause why \nthe Court should not impo se filing restrictions. \nCourt’s Power to Impose Filing Restrictions   The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has discussed the Court’s power \nto impose filing restrictions and the pr ocedure for imposing filing restrictions: \n“[T]he right of access to the courts is neither absolute  nor unconditional and there \nis no constitutional right of access to the courts to prosecute an action that is \nfrivolous or malicious.” Tripati v. Beaman,  878 F.2d 351, 353 (10th Cir.1989) (per \ncuriam) (citation omitted). “There is str ong precedent establis hing the inherent \npower of federal courts to regulate the activities of abusive litigants by imposing \ncarefully tailored restrictions unde r the appropriate circumstances.” Cotner v. \nHopkins,  795 F.2d 900, 902 (10th Cir.1986). “E ven onerous conditions may be \nimposed upon a litigant as long as they are de signed to assist the ... court in curbing \nthe particular abusive be havior involved,” except th at they “cannot be so \nburdensome ... as to deny a litigant meaningful access to the courts.” Id. (brackets \nand internal quotation marks omitted). “Litigiousness alone will not support an \ninjunction restricting filing activities. However, injunc tions are proper where the \nlitigant's abusive and lengthy history is properly set forth.” Tripati,  878 F.2d at 353 \n(citations omitted). “[T]here must be some guidelines as to what [a party] must do to obtain the court's permi ssion to file an action.” Id. at 354. “In additi on, [the party] \nis entitled to notice and an  opportunity to oppose the co urt's order before it is \ninstituted.” Id. A hearing is not required; a wr itten opportunity to respond is \nsufficient. See id.  \n \nLandrith v. Schmidt , 732 F.3d 1171, 1174 (10th Cir. 2013).   \nProposed Filing Restrictions  \n The Court proposes to impose the follo wing filing restrictions on Plaintiff: Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 4 of 75 \n  Plaintiff will be enjoined from making further fi lings in this case exce pt objections to this \norder, a notice of appeal and a moti on for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis ; and the \nClerk will be directed to not fi le any additional submissions by Plai ntiff in this case other than \nobjections to this order, a notice of appeal , or a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma \npauperis,  unless a licensed attorney who is admitted to practice before this Court and has appeared \nin this action signs the proposed filing.    Plaintiff also will be enjoin ed from initiating future litigati on in this Court and the Clerk \nwill be directed to not file a ny initial pleading that Plaintiff submits, unless either a licensed \nattorney who is admitted to practice before this Court signs the pleading or Plaintiff first obtains \npermission to proceed pro se .  See DePineda v. Hemphill , 34 F.3d 946, 948-49 (10th Cir. 1994). \nTo obtain permission to proceed pro se  in this Court, Plaintiff must take the following steps: \n1. File with the Clerk of Court a petition requesting leave to file a pro se initial pleading, a \nnotarized affidavit, the proposed initial plea ding, and a copy of thes e filing restrictions; \n2. The affidavit must be notarized, be in proper le gal form and recite the claims that Plaintiff \nseeks to present, including a short discussion of th e legal bases for the claims, and the basis of the \nCourt’s jurisdiction of the subject matter and parties.  The affidavit must certify that, to the best of \nPlaintiff’s knowledge, Plaintiff's claims are not frivolous or made  in bad faith; that they are \nwarranted by existing law or a good faith argument for th e extension, mo dification, or reversal of \nexisting law; that the new suit is not initiated fo r any improper purpose su ch as delay or needless \nincrease in the cost of litigation; and that Plai ntiff will comply with all Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure and the District of New Mexico’s Local Rules of Civil Procedure.  If Plaintiff’s claims \nhave previously been ra ised or Plaintiff has previously sued the defendants, the affidavit must Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 5 of 76 \n certify that the proposed new suit doe s not present the same claims th at this or any other court has \ndecided and explain why the new suit w ould not be an abuse of the system; \n3.  The Clerk of the Court shal l open a new civil case, file th e petition, the affidavit, the \nproposed pleading and the copy of these restricti ons in the new civil cas e, and randomly assign a \nMagistrate Judge to determine whether to  grant Plaintiff’s petition to proceed pro se  in the new \ncivil case.  See Mem. Op. and Order, Doc. 21 at 6-9, filed in In re Billy L. Edwards , No. 15cv631 \nMCA/SMV (D.N.M. November 13, 2015) (adopting procedure, similar to that of the Tenth Circuit, \nof opening a new case and filing the rest ricted filer’s petition to proceed pro se ).  If the Magistrate \nJudge approves Plaintiff’s petition to proceed pro se , the Magistrate Judge shall enter an order \nindicating that the matter shall proceed in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nand the District of New Mexico’s  Local Rules of Civil Procedure.   If the Magistrate Judge does \nnot approve Plaintiff’s petition to proceed pro se , the Magistrate Judge shall instruct the Clerk to \nassign a District Judge to the new case.  \n IT IS ORDERED that: \n(i) This case is DISMISSED without prejudice.  \n(ii) Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Em ergency Injunction, Doc. 7, filed August 29, \n2025, is DENIED.  \n(iii) Within fourteen (14) days from entry of  this Order, Plaintiff shall show cause why \nthis Court should not enter the proposed  filing restrictions described above. \nPlaintiff’s written objections to the proposed  filing restrictions shall be limited to \n10 pages.  If Plaintiff does not timely file objections, the proposed filing restrictions \nshall take effect fourteen (14) days from th e date of this order and will apply to any Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 6 of 77 \n matter filed after that time.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The United States Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's dismissal of all claims brought by National Security Counselors (NSC) against the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Justice, under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). NSC's requests were denied on grounds that included the prohibition of FOIA to require record creation, the unreasonably burdensome nature of unspecific requests, and the non-waiver of attorney-client privilege. This case involved AI/automation systems as NSC attempted to obtain records on the IBM supercomputer “Watson,” which was denied due to the burdensome nature of the request.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the federal agencies’ refusals to fulfill NSC’s FOIA requests were lawful concerning the creation of new records, the burden of searches, and the withholding of categorized information under attorney-client privilege.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Court held that the agencies acted within their rights to deny the requests as FOIA does not require the creation of new records, an unreasonably burdensome search is not obligatory, and OLC’s references to its opinions did not amount to a waiver of attorney-client privilege.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: In simple terms, imagine you asked a library to gather and organize all books based on a unique theme never categorized before; the librarian would say they can't—it's like creating a new set of shelves from scratch. Similarly, if you asked for everything related to a complex topic like \"AI supercomputers\" without specifics, the librarian might say it's too much work to find everything, everywhere. Also, if someone confided a secret and you told part of it, it doesn't mean you gave away the whole secret. In this case, the court decided the government agencies didn’t have to fulfill requests that either required excessive effort or effectively creating new records, or risked revealing protected secrets.",

USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 1 of 102 \n Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge  SRINIVASAN . \n \nSRINIVASAN , Chief Judge :  National Security Counselors \n(NSC) is a Virginia -based non -profit organization that \ndisseminates  national security materials  to the public.   NSC \nfrequently seeks  to obtain records from intelligence and \ndefense agencies  through the Freedom of Information Act .     \n \nNSC filed three lawsuits in federal district court on the \nsame day in 2011.  The lawsuits together raised  forty -five \nclaims against six federal agencies  arising out of numerous \nFOIA requests initiated by NSC.  The district court, in a series \nof decisions, eventually ruled in favor of the government on all \nof NSC’s  claims.  See Nat ’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA  (NSC I ), \n898 F. Supp. 2d 233 , 290 –91 (D.D .C. 2012); Nat’l Sec. \nCounselors v. CIA  (NSC II ), 960 F. Supp. 2d 10 1, 208 –10 \n(D.D.C. 2013); Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA  (NSC III ), 206 F. \nSupp. 3d 241 , 288 –90 (D.D.C. 2016).   \n \nNSC now appeals , raising a number of challenges to the \ndistrict court’s decisions.  In this opinion, we individually \naddress  (and reject ) three of NSC’s claims:  two claims \nconcerning distinct  FOIA requests made to the Central \nIntelligence Agency and a third claim concerning the \nDepartment of Justice’s assertion of att orney -client privilege in \nresponse to a FOIA request.  While we do not separately \ndiscuss NSC’s remaining claims, we find that none has merit \nand thus affirm the district court in all respects.  \n \nI. \n \nFOIA allows agencies to assess varying fees against  \nrequesters depending on the purpose for which the information \nis sought, the identity of the requester, or both.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4) (A).  In August  2010 , NSC submitted FOIA USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 2 of 103 \n requests to the CIA  for a  listing of all FOIA requesters from \nfiscal year s 2008 to 2010 organized  under  each of four fee \ncategories  contemplated by FOIA :  “news media,” \n“educational or scientific,” “commercial,” or “all other .”  NSC \nFOIA Requests to CIA  (Aug. 8, 2010), 1 J.A. 103 –15; see 5 \nU.S.C.  § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) –(III).   \n \nThe CIA declined to process the requests , explaining, \namong other things, that FOIA does not require an agency to \ncreate records not otherwise in existence .  NSC then brought \nan action under FOIA in the district court, challenging the \nagency’s refusal to process the requests.  The district court \ngranted summary judgment in favor of the CIA .  See NSC II , \n960 F. Supp. 2d at 161.  We review the district court’s grant of \nsummary judgment de novo , see Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. DOJ , \n848 F.3d 467, 470 (D.C. Cir. 2017), and agree with the court’s  \ndisposition .   \n \nFOIA provides for “disclosure of certain documents which \nthe law requires the agency to prepare or which the agency has \ndecided for its own reasons to create.”  NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck \n& Co. , 421 U.S. 132, 162 (1975).   But “FOIA imposes no duty \non the agency to create record s.”  Forsham v. Harris , 445 U.S. \n169, 186 (1980).  FOIA, that is, only requires disclosure of \ndocuments that already exist, not the creation of new records \nnot otherwise in the agency’s possession.  See Yeager v. Drug \nEnf’t Admin. , 678 F.2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982); H.R. Rep. \nNo. 104 –795, at 22  (1996) . \n \nHere, NSC’s request for the CIA to produce listings \naccording to four fee categories of all FOIA requesters over a \ntwo-year period would require the agency to create new \nrecords, not to disclose existing on es.  The CIA’s Information \nReview Officer , whose responsibilities include final review of \ndocuments that are the subject of FOIA requests , submitted a USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 3 of 104 \n declaration in the district court that sets out the relevant \ncapabilities of the agency’s FOIA records sy stem.  Declaration \nof Martha Lutz  ¶ 11 (Dec. 13, 2011) (Lutz Decl.) , 1 J.A. 196.  \nAs she explained, “[f]ee category is not a mandatory field in \nCIA’s current electronic FOIA records system; therefore, this \ninformation is often not included in a FOIA reques t record.”  \nId.  To produce listings of FOIA requesters by fee category  per \nNSC’s request , then, “the CIA’s FOIA analys ts would be \nrequired to individually review each FOIA reque st submitted \nfrom 2008 to 2010 and manually sort thousands of request s \nbased on fee category.”  Id.  That process would \nquintessentially entail  the creation of new records, not the \ndisclosure of preexisting ones.  \n \nAccording to NSC, “sorting a database by field is not \ncreating records, and releasing the information which resu lted \nfrom that sorting action is also not creating records.”  NSC Br. \n16.  We have no occasion here, however, to consider  whether \nsorting a database by field would involve  the creation of new \nrecords.  As the CIA’s declaration establishes, the agency’s \nFOIA database does not contain  the relevant field (i.e. fee \ncategor y) as mandatory information in the first place.  Lutz \nDecl. ¶ 11 , 1 J.A. 196 . \n \nNSC suggests more broadly that “there are no ‘records’ to \nspeak of in an electronic database in which information  is \nentered into fields.”  NSC Br. 16.  FOIA makes clear , though,  \nthat a “record” within the meaning of the statute includes \ninformation “that would be an agency record . . . when \nmaintained by an agency in any format, including an electronic \nformat.”  5 U .S.C. § 552(f)(2)(A); see Yeager , 678 F.2d at 321.  \nBut regardless of whether a given record exists in an electronic \nor paper format (or both), the statute only calls for the \ndisclosure of existing records, not the generation of new ones.  \nAnd whatever que stions may arise in future cases about when USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 4 of 105 \n disclosing the results of an electronic search of records entails  \ncreation of a record, here, responding to NSC’s request would \nrequire manual review and sorting of numerous electronic \nrecords and  the ensuing  compilation of lists that do not \notherwise exist.  That exercise self -evidently amounts to \nrecords creation, which FOIA does not require.  \n \nII. \n \nWe next consider another FOIA request NSC made to the \nCIA, this one for “all Central Intelligence Agency (‘CIA’ ) \nrecords pertaining to the IBM supercomputer named \n‘Watson.’”  CIA Request Correspondence (Feb. 16, 2011), 1 \nJ.A. 275.  NSC added “that agencies have a duty to construe \nthe subject material of FOIA requests liberally to ensure \nresponsive records are not o verlooked.”  Id.  The CIA declined \nto process the request “in its current form because it would \nrequire the Agency to perform an unreasonably burdensome \nsearch.”  CIA Request Correspondence (Mar . 2, 2011),  1 J.A. \n280.  The CIA invited NSC “to refine the sc ope of [its] request \n(such as contracts, if they exist, which would explain records \npertaining to ‘Watson’) to enable [the agency] to conduct a \nreasonable search for responsive information.”  Id.   \n \n NSC did not narrow the scope of its request, but instead  \nfiled a lawsuit challenging the CIA’s response.  The district \ncourt granted summary judgment to the CIA.  NSC II , 960 F. \nSupp. 2d at 163.   We again agree with the district court’s \ndisposition.   \n \n FOIA imposes obligations on agencies to disclose records \nfor requests that “reasonably describe[] such records.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A).  We have explained that agencies “need \nnot honor a request that requires ‘an unreasonably burdensome \nsearch.’”  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. Local 2782 v. U.S. Dep’t USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 5 of 106 \n of Commerce , 907 F.2d 203, 209 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing \nGoland v. CIA , 607 F.2d 339, 353 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).  We have \nalso established that agencies should read FOIA request s “as \ndrafted, not as either agency officials or [the requester] might \nwish it was drafted.”  Miller v. Casey , 730 F.2d 773, 777 (D.C. \nCir. 1984).  The upshot is that, when the request as drafted \nwould require an agency to undertake an unreasonably \nburdenso me search, the agency can decline to process the \nrequest.   \n \n That is what happened here.  As the CIA’s Information \nReview Officer explained in her declaration, “it is difficult to \ndetermine where responsive information would likely be \nlocated within the Agency because the request is so general.”  \nLutz.  Decl. ¶ 31 , 1 J.A. 204 .  “CIA’s records,” she advised, \n“are decentralized and compartmented.  Each directorate . . . \nmust determine which components and/or records systems \nwithin the directorate might reasonably be expected to possess \nrecords responsive to a particular request.”  Id. at ¶ 30.  As a \nresult, “the CIA would be required to search every office for \nany documents containing the word ‘Watson,’” which would \namount to a “massive undertaking.”  Id. at ¶ 31, 1 J.A. 205 . \n \n NSC does not dispute that a search for all documents \nanywhere in the CIA related to “Watson” would be unduly \nburdensome.  NSC instead submits that the CIA gave the \nrequest an “overbroad reading,” in that the request should have \nbeen understood to encompass only “records about how the \ndevelopment of Watson impacted the Intelligence Community, \nspecifically with respect to the application of comparable \nartificial intelligence systems to intelligence analysis.”  NSC \nBr. 27.  The request , though, does not say that .  Instead, it  is \nframed broadly to seek “all [CIA] records pertaining to the \nIBM supercomputer ‘Watson,’” with an added emphasis “to \nconstrue” it “ liberally .”  CIA Request Correspondence, 1 J.A. USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 6 of 107 \n 275.  To be sure, NSC, when askin g for a public -interest fee \nwaiver in its letter transmitting the request , said that responsive \nrecords would “serve as a case study for the CIA’s involvement \nin artificial intelligence research.”  Id. at 277.  But the request \nitself was not so confined, a nd NSC did not refine its request \nafter the CIA invited it to do so.  \n \nThe agency interpreted NSC’s request as drafted, as our \ndecisions direct.  Miller , 730 F.2d at 777.  And the agency and \nthe district court correctly concluded that, as drafted, the \nreque st called for an unreasonably burdensome search.  \n \nIII. \n \nWe next consider a FOIA request submitted by NSC to the \nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice.  \nThe request sought OLC opinions pertaining to  various statutes \nincluding FOIA itsel f, the Privacy Act, and the Federal Records \nAct.  See NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 119.  OLC  withheld a \nnumber of its responsive opinions under FOIA Exemption 5 \nbased on the attorney -client privilege.  See id. at 119 –20, 196.  \nFor two of the opinions, the district court determined that OLC, \nin other official settings, had referenced the opinions’ legal \nconclusions or conv eyed a summary of the opinions.  Id. at \n197–99.  The court thus ordered OLC to disclose those portions \nof the two opinions that corresponded with the disclosures in \nthe other settings, id. at 199 –200, which OLC did.   \n \nThe district court, in ordering discl osure of those parts of \nthe two opinions, relied on decisions holding that, when \ninformation has been officially acknowledged and voluntarily \ndisclosed in a public domain, “a FOIA plaintiff may compel \ndisclosure of that information even over an agency’s ot herwise \nvalid exemption claim.”  ACLU v. U.S. Dep’t of Def. , 628 F.3d \n612, 620  (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Wolf v. CIA , 473 F.3d 370, USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 7 of 108 \n 378 (D.C. Cir. 2007)) ; see NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 198 .  The \ndistrict court subsequently rejected NSC’s contention that it  \nwas entitled to the full contents of the two OLC opinions, not \njust the portions corresponding with the official \nacknowledgments.  NSC III , 206 F. Supp. 3d at 288.  NSC now \nrenews its argument that OLC should have been compelled to \nrelease the full conten ts of the two opinions.  We disagree.  \n \nNSC draws a distinction between two potential grounds \nfor compelling disclosure of the full OLC opinions \nnotwithstanding OLC’s assertion of the attorney -client \nprivilege:  (i) the above -referenced “official acknowledg ment” \ndoctrine, under which an agency cannot withhold information \npursuant to any FOIA exemption when there has previously \nbeen a voluntary, official acknowledgment of the information \nto the public, see, e.g. , Wolf , 473 F.3d at 378; and (ii) waiver \nof the attorney -client privilege itself as to the two opinions.  \nNSC does not dispute that, with regard to the first of those \npotential grounds (which it describes as “significantly \nnarrower”), it was entitled to disclosure only of the parts of the \nOLC opinions t hat the district court ordered be disclosed, not \nthe full opinions.  See NSC Br. 52 –53.  NSC’s argument instead \nis that it was entitled to the full OLC opinions because there \nhad been a waiver of the attorney -client privilege.  See id.  \nAccording to NSC, waiver of the attorney -client privilege \ngenerally effects a waiver as to all material relating to the same \nsubject matter, thus requiring disclosure of the full OLC \nopinions.  Id. \n \nWe conclude, though, that there was no waiver of the \nattorney-client privilege with regard to the two OLC opinions.  \nIn the case of  one of the opinions, the waiver ostensibly \noccurred when OLC cited a legal conclusion contained in it in \nthe course of another , publicly  disclosed  opinion.  See NSC II , \n960 F. Supp.  2d at 198.  In the case of  the second OLC opinion, USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 8 of 109 \n the waiver ostensibly occurred when an OLC attorney provided \na “summary of a summary” of the opinion in an interagency \ncommittee meeting.  See id. at 197.  Neither of those events \neffected a waiver of the  privilege with regard to the two \nreferenced opinions.  \n \nWe need not assess whether the nature of the references to \nthe two opinions sufficed to constitute a waiver of the attorney -\nclient privilege.  That is because, in any event, the references \nwere made b y the attorney (OLC), not the client (the agency to \nwhich OLC gave advice).  Disclosure “by the holder” of the \nprivilege can give rise to a waiver, In re Subpoenas Duces \nTecum , 738 F.2d 1367 , 1369  (D.C. Cir. 1984) , and as NSC \nrecognizes, it “is axiomatic t hat the attorney -client privilege is \nheld by the client ,” NSC Br. 53 n.7.  As a result, an “attorney \nis given the power to claim the privilege on behalf of the client \nbut his betrayal of the client’s secret is not treated as a waiver \nof the privilege.”  26A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice & Procedure  § 5724  (1st ed. 2020) ; see also  Hanson \nv. USAID, 372 F.3d 286, 29 4 (4th Cir. 2004) (“an attorney may \nnot unilaterally waive the privilege that his client enjoys”);  In \nre Sealed Case , 737 F.2d 94, 98 –99 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (the \nprivilege applies if “not waived by the client”) .  OLC’s own \ndisclosures concerning the two opinio ns at issue, then, did not \neffect a waiver of the attorney -client privilege , at least absent \nany indication (absent here) that OLC was acting on behalf of \nthe client when making the disclosures .  See Hanson , 372 F.3d \nat 294 . \n \nIt is true that the district court, in the course of explaining \nthat there had been an official acknowledgment of the two \nopinions so as to implicate the official -acknowledgment \ndoctrine, went on to say that there had also been a waiver of the \nattorney -client privilege.  See NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 198.  \nFor the reasons explained, however, we conclude that there was USCA Case #18-5047      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 9 of 1010 \n no such waiver in the circumstances.  We therefore have no \noccasion to address whether, if there had been a waiver of the \nprivilege in conne ction with the two opinions,  disclosure of the \nfull opinions would have been necessary as a matter of course .  \nSee In re Sealed Case , 121 F.3d 729, 741  (D.C. Cir. 1997) .  \nRather, because there was no waiver to begin with, we reject \nNSC’s argument that it w as entitled to disclosure of the full \nOLC opinions on a privilege -waiver theory.  \n \n*     *     *     *     *  \n \n NSC advances an array of additional arguments \nconcerning various aspects of district court’s decisions under \nreview.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** This case involves Subash Kumar's challenge against USCIS's decision to deny his petition for an immigrant visa as a non-citizen of extraordinary ability in data science, specifically citing a failure to satisfy at least three out of the ten required criteria. Though Kumar attempted to present evidence for several criteria, USCIS found only one criterion met concerning his authorship of scholarly articles. As a part of his case, Kumar included expert testimony about his abilities in the AI field, but USCIS deemed the additional evidence insufficient, and the court ultimately upheld USCIS's decision, finding it was not arbitrary or capricious.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether USCIS acted arbitrarily or capriciously in denying Subash Kumar's visa petition by determining he did not satisfy the regulatory criteria to qualify as a non-citizen of extraordinary ability.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that USCIS's decision to deny Kumar's petition was not arbitrary or capricious, finding that the agency had a rational basis for its decision based on the evidence submitted, and therefore granted USCIS's motion for summary judgment and denied Kumar's cross-motion.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Kumar wanted a special visa for being awesome at his job, saying he's super good at data science. The visa people looked at his proof but thought it wasn’t enough to show he’s one of the very best. Kumar said that wasn’t fair and asked the court to help. The court checked and agreed with the visa people, saying they did everything right by their rules, so Kumar didn’t get the visa this time.",

Kumar is a senior da ta analyst  from \nIndia  who filed a Form I -140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker classification as a non-\ncitizen of extraordinary ability in data science. (ECF No. 5 -2 at 22.) On April 27, 2022, USCIS \ndetermined that Kumar had failed to establish eligibili ty for the classification based on the \nevidence he presented and requested further evidence (“Request for Evidence” or “RFE”). \nKumar responded to the RFE on September 22, 2022. USCIS issued a Notice of Denial on February 17, 2023 on the grounds that Kumar had not established that he was eligible for \nclassification as a non- citizen of extraordinary ability by satisfying at least three of the ten \nspecific regulatory criteria of 8 C.F.R. §  204.5(h)(3). USCIS determined that Kumar met only \none of the ten criteria , “evidence of the beneficiary’s authorship of scholarly articles in the \nfield, in professional or major trade publication or other major media .” (ECF No. 5 -2 at 6.) Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 1 of 122 \n Because USCIS determined that Kumar failed to meet at least three of the ten criteria, i t did \nnot proceed to the second step of the analysis, whether Kumar had sustained a level of national \nor international acclaim and was one of the small percentage who had risen to the very top of \nthe field of endeavor. ( Id. at 32.) Accordingly, USCIS concl uded that Kumar was not an \nindividual of extraordinary ability and was not eligible for the corresponding alien worker \nclassification. On August 17, 2023, Kumar filed suit in this Court against the Director of \nUSCIS . (ECF No. 1.) He seeks  to challenge the decision to deny him a classification as a non-\ncitizen of extraordinary ability. Kumar alleges USCIS’s decision was arbitrary and capricious  \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA), 5 U.S.C. §  702,  et seq. , and he asks this Court \nto set aside the decision and to remand the case for further consideration.  \nPresently pending is Defendant’s  Motion  to Dismiss or  for Summary Judgment. (ECF \nNo. 8.) In it, USCIS  argues that “[t]he USCIS decision is well -supported, and consistent with \napplicable regulations, statutes and published USCIS guidance. The Agency thoroughly \nconsidered all of the evidence submitted and provided detailed findings to support its conclusion .  . . .” (ECF No. 8 -1 at 6.) Plaintiff filed a Response and Cross -Motion for \nSummary  Judgment. (ECF No. 15.) USCIS  filed a Reply in support of its own motion and in \nopposition to Plaintiff’s cross -motion. (ECF No. 16.) Plaintiff  filed a reply in support of its \nown motion. (ECF No. 17.) USCIS  then filed a line notice (ECF No. 18), which Pl aintiff seeks \nto strike as an unauthorized surreply (ECF No. 19).  USCIS  responded (ECF No. 22) that the \nLine is not a surreply memorandum but requested leave nunc pro tunc  to file it as a surreply if \nthe Court construed it as such.  The parties’ submissions have been reviewed, and no hearing \nis necessary. See Loc. R. 105.6.  For the reasons stated below, USCIS ’s Motion (ECF No. 8), Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 2 of 123 \n construed as a motion for summary judgment, is GRANTED , and Plaintiff’s Cross -Motion \nfor Summary Judgment (ECF No. 16) is DENIED . Because the line is unnecessary to this \nCourt’s decision, Plaintiff’s motion to strike (ECF No. 19) is GRANTED.  \nBACKGROUND  \nNon-citizens of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or \nathletics  may qualify for immigrant visas under 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(1)(A).  This section allows \nvisas to be granted if:  \n(i) the non- citizen has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education,  \nbusiness, or athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or \ninternational acclaim a nd whose achievements have been  recognized in the field \nthrough extensive documentation;  \n \n(ii) the non- citizen seeks to enter the United States to continue work in the area  \nof extraordinary ability; and  (iii) the non- citizen ’s entry into the United States  will substantially benefit  \nprospectively the United States.  \n \n8 U.S.C. §  1153(b)(1)(A). Extraordinary ability in this context means “a level of expertise \nindicating that the individual is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of \nthe field of endeavor.” 56 Fed. Reg. 60,897, 60,906 (INS) (Nov. 29, 1991) (codified at 8 C.F.R. \n§ 204.5(h)(2)).  Extraordinary ability is thus a higher standard than “ exceptional  ability” under \n8 U.S.C. §  1153(b)(2)(A).  \n USCIS employs a two -step approach to det ermine extraordinary ability immigrant visa \neligibility. First, the petitioner must submit evidence that he  or she  has “sustained national or \ninternational acclaim and that his or her achievements have been recognized in the field of \nexpertise.” 8 C.F.R. §  204.5(h)(3).  This may be demonstrated through a one -time achievement \nsuch as an Olympic gold medal or a Nobel Prize, or, alternatively, through evidence that Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 3 of 124 \n satisfies at least three of ten specific regulatory  criteria. 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i)–(x).  If the \npetitioner provides evidence satisfying either standard, USCIS then considers the totality of \nthe evidence to determine whether the non -citizen has demonstrated that he  or she  is one of \nthat small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor, has sustained national or international acclaim, and that hiher achievements have been recognized in the field of expertise. 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3).  The petitioner bears the burden of proof by a \npreponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 103.2( b)(1); Matter of Chawathe , 25 I. & N. Dec. 369, \n375 (2010) . \n Defendant USCIS received Plaintiff Subash Kumar’s Form I -140 petition for \nclassification as a non -citizen of extraordinary ability on June 10, 2021. (ECF No. 5 -2 at 21.) \nKumar , a citizen and national of India,  argued that he was a non- citizen of extraordinary ability \nin Data Science as a “Senior Data Analyst.” ( Id. at 24.) He sought to demonstrate his status as \na non- citizen of extraordinary ability by providing evidence meeting six of the ten criteria:  \nii. Evidence of membership in associations in the field which demand \noutstanding achievement of their members  \niii. Evidence of published material about you in professional or major trade \npublications  or other major media  \nv. Evidence of yo ur original scientific, scholarly, artistic, athletic, or business -\nrelated contributions of major significance to the field  \nvi. Evidence of your authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media  \nvii. Evidence that your work has been displayed at artistic exhibitions or showcases.  \nviii. Evidence of your performance of a leading or critical role in distinguished \norganizations  \n \n(ECF No. 5 -3 at 86 –87 (citing 8 C.F.R. §  204.5(h)(3)) .) USCIS determined that Kumar met \nthe sixth criterion out of the ten potential criteria (evidence of authorship of scholarly articles \nin professional or major trade publications or other major media). (ECF No. 5 -2 at 36.) Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 4 of 125 \n However, it requested further evidence (“Request for Evidence” or “RFE”)  for the other five \ncriteria, as  the previously submitted evidence did not meet the criteria. ( Id. at 33 –38.)  \n Kumar responded to the RFE on September 22, 2022. (ECF No. 5 -2 at 40.) With his \nresponse, Kumar enclosed an “expert opinion letter” from Dr. Richard Scott Linder, a \nProfessor of Mathematics and Statistics at Ohio Wesleyan University. ( Id. at 41.) Dr. Linder \nopined that “Mr. Kumar has extraordinary ability in the Artificial Intelligence field and has satisfied at least four of the criteria of the USCIS for classificati on as an Alien of Extraordinary \nAbility.” ( Id.) Kumar also included a letter stating that Kumar is a member of the American \nAssociation for Cancer Research ( “AACR ”), a letter discussing his participation in the MD \nTHINK Integration Project , newspaper article s with circulation data , and photograph s of \nKumar receiving an award. ( Id. at 42 –46.)  \n On February 17, 2023, USCIS issued a Notice of Denial to Kumar. (Id. at 1.)  The \nNotice stated that Kumar’s petition was denied because he failed to meet at least three of the ten specific regulatory criteria. As before, he met the sixth criterion (evidence of authorship of scholarly articles in professional or major trade publications or other major media). However, \nthe evidence he submitted failed to meet the other fi ve criteria he sought  to meet. USCIS \ntherefore concluded that he was not eligible for classification as a non -citizen of extraordinary \nability.  \nOn August 17, 2023, Kumar filed suit in this Court against the Director of USCIS . \n(ECF No. 1.) He seeks  to chal lenge the decision to deny him a classification as a non- citizen \nof extraordinary ability. Kumar alleges USCIS’s decision was arbitrary and capricious under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA ”), 5 U.S.C. §  702,  et seq. , and he asks this Court to Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 5 of 126 \n set aside the decision and to remand the case for further consideration. Presently pending is \nDefendant’s Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 8.) In it, USCIS  argues \nthat “[t]he USCIS decision is well -supported, a nd consistent with applicable regulations, \nstatutes and published USCIS guidance. The Agency thoroughly considered all of the evidence submitted and provided detailed findings to support its conclusion  . . . .” (ECF No. 8 -1 at 6.) \nPlaintiff filed a Respons e and Cross -Motion for Summary Judgment. (ECF No. 15.) USCIS  \nfiled a Reply in support of its own motion and in opposition to Plaintiff’s cross -motion. (ECF \nNo. 16.) Plaintiff filed a reply in support of its own motion. (ECF No. 17.)  USCIS  then filed \na line notice (ECF No. 18), which Plaintiff seeks to strike as an unauthorized surreply (ECF \nNo. 19). USCIS  responded (ECF No. 22) that the Line is not a surreply memorandum but \nrequested leave nunc pro tunc  to file it as a surreply if the Court construed it as  such.  The matters \nare ripe for review.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \nThe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701,  et seq. , in conjunction with \nthe federal -question jurisdiction statute, provides the statutory basis for a court to review a \nfinal agency a ction. Claims seeking review of an agency action under the APA “are adjudicated \nwithout a trial or discovery, on the basis of an existing administrative record .  . . [and \naccordingly] are properly decided on summary judgment. ” Audubon Naturalist Soc ’y of the Cent. \nAtl. States, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t  of Transp. , 524 F. Supp. 2d 642, 659 (D. Md. 2007). The standard \nset forth in Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing summary judgment “does not apply because of the limited role of a court reviewi ng the administrative record.” \nHospira, Inc. v. Burwell , No. GJH -14-2662, 2014 WL 4406901, at *9 (D. Md. Sept. 5, 2014) Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 6 of 127 \n (citing Roberts v. United States , 883 F. Supp. 2d 56, 62 –63 (D.D.C. 2012 )). Rather, summary \njudgment is the mechanism by which the court decides as a matter of law whether “the \nadministrative record permitted the agency to make the decision it did.” Hospira , 2014 WL \n4406901, at *9  (quoting Kaiser Found. Hosps. v . Sebelius , 828 F.  Supp. 2d 193, 198 (D.D.C. 2011 ), \naff’d, 708 F.3d 226 (D.C. Cir. 2013)).  \nANALYSIS  \nUnder the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA ”), 5 U.S.C. §  702, et seq. , “a ‘reviewing \ncourt shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be [ ] arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the \nlaw.’” Chao v. Sessions , 698 F. App’x 751, 752 (4th Cir. 2017) (alterations in original) (quoting 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). On the other hand, a court must uphold an action i f the record shows \nthat the agency had a rational basis for the decision; the court may not “substitute its judgment \nfor that of the agency.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc.  v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983); Defs. of Wildlife v. N .C. Dep’t of Transp. , 762 F.3d 374, 396 (4th Cir. \n2014).  “Review under this standard is highly deferential, with a presumption in favor of finding \nthe agency action valid.” Ohio Valley Env’t  Coal. v. Aracoma Coal Co ., 556 F.3d 177, 192 (4th Cir. \n2009) . “In other words, ‘ so long as the agency provides an explanation of its decision that \nincludes a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, its decision \nshould be sustained. ’” Nat’l Audubon So c’y v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng ’rs, 991 F.3d 577, 583 (4th \nCir. 2021) (quoting  Am. Whitewater v. Tidwell , 770 F.3d 1108, 1115 (4th Cir. 2014) ).   \nKeeping these principles in mind, whi le reviewing an agency decision  the court “must \nconsider whether the decisi on was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 7 of 128 \n whether there has been a clear error of judgment.” Marsh v. Oregon Natural Res. Council , 490 \nU.S. 360, 378 (1989) (quoting Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe , 401 U.S. 402, 416 \n(1971)). An agency’s decision is arbitrary and capricious if the agency:  \nRelied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed \nto consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its \ndecision that runs cou nter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible \nthat it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.  \n \nDefenders of Wildlife , 762 F.3d at 396 (quoting State Farm , 463 U.S. at 43).  \n In this case, it is plain that USCIS’s decision was not arbitrary and capricious. USCIS \ncarefully considered all of the evidence submitted by Kumar for each of the categories he \nattempted to meet, and it even stated that he met one of the criteria. Neverth eless, the evidence \nKumar submitted was insufficient to meet any of the other five criteria he sought to meet, as \ndiscussed in the Denial. For thoroughness, this Court will review each of the “relevant \nfactors ,” which were  considered by USCIS.  Md. Dep’t of  Health & Mental Hygiene v. Ctrs.  For \nMedicare & Medicaid Servs. , 542 F.3d 424, 427 (4th Cir. 2008) . \nAs to the second criterion (membership in associations), USCIS stated that “[t] he plain \nlanguage of this criterion requires  evidence ( 1) of me mbership in associations, (2) that the \nassociations are in  the beneficiary’s field,  (3) that the associations require outstanding \nachievements of their members, and (4) that membership eligibility is judged  by recognized \nnational or international experts i n their field. ” (ECF No. 5 -2 at 3.) USCIS acknowledged that \nKumar submitted documentation establishing him as a member of  the American  Association \nfor Cancer Research (AACR ) but  noted that the documentation did “not indicate that they \nrequire outstanding a chievements and use recognized national or international experts to Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 8 of 129 \n determine which individuals qualify for membership.” ( Id.) Based on the documentation \nsubmitted, therefore, Kumar’s membership in AACR failed to satisfy the third and fourth \naspects of the  second criterion . As a result, Kumar failed to meet th e plain language of the  \ncriterion.  \nAs to the third criterion (published material in media), USCIS stated that “[t]he plain \nlanguage of this criterion requires evidence (1) of published material, (2) th at the published \nmaterial contains the title, date, and author of the material, and any necessary translation, (3) \nthat the published material is about the beneficiary relating to the beneficiary’s work in the \nfield, and (4) that the published material qualifies as professional or major trade publications  \nor other major media.” ( Id. at 4.) The evidence Kumar submitted did not include the title, date, \nor author for the “Book on AI to Combat Covid ,” and it also failed to include a discussion of  \nthe beneficiary and the beneficiary’s work in “The New Artificial Intelligence Against Coronavirus.” ( Id.) Nor did Kumar submit sufficient  evidence to establish that the material \nqualified as professional or major trade publications or other major media. ( Id.) Accordingly, \nKumar failed to meet second and fourth aspects of the third criterion , and therefore he failed \nto meet the plain languag e of the criterion.  \nAs to the fifth criterion (original contributions of major significance), USCIS noted \nthat “[t]he plain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) of the beneficiary’s  \ncontributions related to scientific, scholarly, artistic or bu siness fields, (2) that the beneficiary’s \ncontribution is original, and (3) that the beneficiary’s  original contribution has been of major \nsignificance.” ( Id. at 5.) USCIS noted that the evidence Kumar submitted failed to establish \nthe major significance of his contributions, even while recognizing that Kumar submitted Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 9 of 1210 \n letters from individuals in his field that USCIS quoted in its denial. While acknowledging those \nletters, USCIS noted that the letters failed to demonstrate how Kumar’s “work has been of majo r significance to the field of Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning and Deep Learning \nas a whole.” ( Id. at 6.) Notwithstanding those letters, Kumar failed to provide “preexisting, \nindependent, and objective evidence.” ( Id.) Likewise, Kumar failed to pr ovide evidence \nsupporting the issuance  of a patent for which he had applied. Accordingly, USCIS determined \nthat the evidence Kumar submitted was insufficient  to meet the  third aspect of the  original \ncontributions of major significance criterion. Kumar therefore failed to meet the fifth criterion.  \nAs to the seventh criterion (artistic exhibitions or showcases), USCIS noted that “[t]he \nplain language of this criterion requires evidence (1) of the beneficiary’s work in the field, and (2) that the beneficiary’s  work in the field has been displayed in  an artistic exhibition or \nshowcase.” ( Id.) Although USCIS acknowledged that Kumar submitted evidence that his book \nwas displayed at a book fair, it noted that there was nothing to suggest that the book fair “is artistic or the event at the time was artistic in nature.” ( Id.) USCIS also rightfully concluded \nthat Kumar’s presentation of his book at a scientific conference did not meet the criterion for \npresentation at an artistic exhibition.  Kumar therefore failed to meet the plain language of the \nseventh criterion.  \nLastly, as to the eighth criterion (leading role in distinguished organization), USCIS \nnoted that “[t]he plain language of this criterion requires evidence ( 1) that the beneficiary \nperformed a role of  ran organization or establishment (2) that the beneficiary’s  role is/was \nleading or critical, and (3) that the beneficiary’s  leading or critical role is/was for an \norganization or establishment with a d istinguished reputation.” ( Id. at 7.)  USCIS acknowledged  Case 1:23-cv-02251-RDB   Document 23   Filed 04/01/24   Page 10 of 1211 \n the letters of support that Kumar submitted regarding his role with the MD THINK \nIntegration Project, but it noted that the documentation did “not provide specific information about the beneficiary’s duties.” ( Id.) Without this, USCIS could not conclude t hat Kumar had \na “critical or leading role.” ( Id.) Neither did the evidence that Kumar submitted support a \nfinding that his organization had “a distinguished reputation.” (Id.) Again, the letters submitted \non Kumar’s behalf were not supported by “preexistin g, independent, and objective evidence.” \n(Id. at 8.) Accordingly, USCIS concluded Kumar failed to meet the second and third aspects \nof the leading role in a distinguished organization criterion.  Kumar therefore failed to meet \nthe eighth criterion.  \nGiven USCIS’s thorough evaluation of the evidence Kumar submitted with regard to \neach of these categories, its decision to deny Kumar a extraordinary ability immigrant visa was \nnot arbitrary and caprici ous. As Judge Russell of this Court has noted, a court reviewing an \nagency action under the arbitrary and capricious standard “ must uphold an action if the record \nshows that the agency had a rational basis for the decision, and the court may not ‘substitut e \nits judgment for that of the agency. ’” Blast v. Mayorkas , No. CV GLR -22-1878, 2023 WL \n6307821, at *8 (D. Md. Sept. 28, 2023) (quoting  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the U.S., Inc.  v. State \nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins.

The record reflects USCIS plainly had a rational basis for its \ndecision, and there are no grounds to vacate its decision under this “ highly deferential \nstandard. ” Nat. Res. Def.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of all claims by National Security Counselors (NSC) against the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). The appeals involved multiple FOIA requests where the CIA refused to create new records not already in existence and declined a burdensome search, and the DOJ invoked attorney-client privilege on certain legal opinions, which NSC argued were improperly withheld. The case did not involve artificial intelligence directly in the claims or holdings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the CIA and DOJ properly denied FOIA requests by NSC on the grounds that they either sought the creation of new records, required an unreasonably burdensome search, or involved privileged attorney-client communications.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that FOIA does not require agencies to create new records or conduct unreasonably burdensome searches. Moreover, it found no waiver of attorney-client privilege with respect to legal opinions referenced externally by the DOJ.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you ask a library for a list of people who borrowed books with certain categories in the past. The library says, \"We can't do that because we don’t keep records like that, and creating them from scratch would be a lot of extra work.\" You also ask them for advice documents lawyers wrote, but they're not giving them because, even though the ideas might be public, sharing the whole document could break lawyer-client confidentiality rules. The court agreed with the library (CIA/DOJ) saying they're following the rules correctly.",

USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 1 of 102 \n Opinion for the Court filed by Chief Judge  SRINIVASAN . \n \nSRINIVASAN , Chief Judge :  National Security Counselors \n(NSC) is a Virginia -based non -profit organization that \ndisseminates  national security materials  to the public.   NSC \nfrequently seeks  to obtain records from intelligence and \ndefense agencies  through the Freedom of Information Act .     \n \nNSC filed three lawsuits in federal district court on the \nsame day in 2011.  The lawsuits together raised  forty -five \nclaims against six federal agencies  arising out of numerous \nFOIA requests initiated by NSC.  The district court, in a series \nof decisions, eventually ruled in favor of the government on all \nof NSC’s  claims.  See Nat ’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA  (NSC I ), \n898 F. Supp. 2d 233 , 290 –91 (D.D .C. 2012); Nat’l Sec. \nCounselors v. CIA  (NSC II ), 960 F. Supp. 2d 10 1, 208 –10 \n(D.D.C. 2013); Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. CIA  (NSC III ), 206 F. \nSupp. 3d 241 , 288 –90 (D.D.C. 2016).   \n \nNSC now appeals , raising a number of challenges to the \ndistrict court’s decisions.  In this opinion, we individually \naddress  (and reject ) three of NSC’s claims:  two claims \nconcerning distinct  FOIA requests made to the Central \nIntelligence Agency and a third claim concerning the \nDepartment of Justice’s assertion of att orney -client privilege in \nresponse to a FOIA request.  While we do not separately \ndiscuss NSC’s remaining claims, we find that none has merit \nand thus affirm the district court in all respects.  \n \nI. \n \nFOIA allows agencies to assess varying fees against  \nrequesters depending on the purpose for which the information \nis sought, the identity of the requester, or both.  See 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4) (A).  In August  2010 , NSC submitted FOIA USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 2 of 103 \n requests to the CIA  for a  listing of all FOIA requesters from \nfiscal year s 2008 to 2010 organized  under  each of four fee \ncategories  contemplated by FOIA :  “news media,” \n“educational or scientific,” “commercial,” or “all other .”  NSC \nFOIA Requests to CIA  (Aug. 8, 2010), 1 J.A. 103 –15; see 5 \nU.S.C.  § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I) –(III).   \n \nThe CIA declined to process the requests , explaining, \namong other things, that FOIA does not require an agency to \ncreate records not otherwise in existence .  NSC then brought \nan action under FOIA in the district court, challenging the \nagency’s refusal to process the requests.  The district court \ngranted summary judgment in favor of the CIA .  See NSC II , \n960 F. Supp. 2d at 161.  We review the district court’s grant of \nsummary judgment de novo , see Nat’l Sec. Counselors v. DOJ , \n848 F.3d 467, 470 (D.C. Cir. 2017), and agree with the court’s  \ndisposition .   \n \nFOIA provides for “disclosure of certain documents which \nthe law requires the agency to prepare or which the agency has \ndecided for its own reasons to create.”  NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck \n& Co. , 421 U.S. 132, 162 (1975).   But “FOIA imposes no duty \non the agency to create record s.”  Forsham v. Harris , 445 U.S. \n169, 186 (1980).  FOIA, that is, only requires disclosure of \ndocuments that already exist, not the creation of new records \nnot otherwise in the agency’s possession.  See Yeager v. Drug \nEnf’t Admin. , 678 F.2d 315, 321 (D.C. Cir. 1982); H.R. Rep. \nNo. 104 –795, at 22  (1996) . \n \nHere, NSC’s request for the CIA to produce listings \naccording to four fee categories of all FOIA requesters over a \ntwo-year period would require the agency to create new \nrecords, not to disclose existing on es.  The CIA’s Information \nReview Officer , whose responsibilities include final review of \ndocuments that are the subject of FOIA requests , submitted a USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 3 of 104 \n declaration in the district court that sets out the relevant \ncapabilities of the agency’s FOIA records sy stem.  Declaration \nof Martha Lutz  ¶ 11 (Dec. 13, 2011) (Lutz Decl.) , 1 J.A. 196.  \nAs she explained, “[f]ee category is not a mandatory field in \nCIA’s current electronic FOIA records system; therefore, this \ninformation is often not included in a FOIA reques t record.”  \nId.  To produce listings of FOIA requesters by fee category  per \nNSC’s request , then, “the CIA’s FOIA analys ts would be \nrequired to individually review each FOIA reque st submitted \nfrom 2008 to 2010 and manually sort thousands of request s \nbased on fee category.”  Id.  That process would \nquintessentially entail  the creation of new records, not the \ndisclosure of preexisting ones.  \n \nAccording to NSC, “sorting a database by field is not \ncreating records, and releasing the information which resu lted \nfrom that sorting action is also not creating records.”  NSC Br. \n16.  We have no occasion here, however, to consider  whether \nsorting a database by field would involve  the creation of new \nrecords.  As the CIA’s declaration establishes, the agency’s \nFOIA database does not contain  the relevant field (i.e. fee \ncategor y) as mandatory information in the first place.  Lutz \nDecl. ¶ 11 , 1 J.A. 196 . \n \nNSC suggests more broadly that “there are no ‘records’ to \nspeak of in an electronic database in which information  is \nentered into fields.”  NSC Br. 16.  FOIA makes clear , though,  \nthat a “record” within the meaning of the statute includes \ninformation “that would be an agency record . . . when \nmaintained by an agency in any format, including an electronic \nformat.”  5 U .S.C. § 552(f)(2)(A); see Yeager , 678 F.2d at 321.  \nBut regardless of whether a given record exists in an electronic \nor paper format (or both), the statute only calls for the \ndisclosure of existing records, not the generation of new ones.  \nAnd whatever que stions may arise in future cases about when USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 4 of 105 \n disclosing the results of an electronic search of records entails  \ncreation of a record, here, responding to NSC’s request would \nrequire manual review and sorting of numerous electronic \nrecords and  the ensuing  compilation of lists that do not \notherwise exist.  That exercise self -evidently amounts to \nrecords creation, which FOIA does not require.  \n \nII. \n \nWe next consider another FOIA request NSC made to the \nCIA, this one for “all Central Intelligence Agency (‘CIA’ ) \nrecords pertaining to the IBM supercomputer named \n‘Watson.’”  CIA Request Correspondence (Feb. 16, 2011), 1 \nJ.A. 275.  NSC added “that agencies have a duty to construe \nthe subject material of FOIA requests liberally to ensure \nresponsive records are not o verlooked.”  Id.  The CIA declined \nto process the request “in its current form because it would \nrequire the Agency to perform an unreasonably burdensome \nsearch.”  CIA Request Correspondence (Mar . 2, 2011),  1 J.A. \n280.  The CIA invited NSC “to refine the sc ope of [its] request \n(such as contracts, if they exist, which would explain records \npertaining to ‘Watson’) to enable [the agency] to conduct a \nreasonable search for responsive information.”  Id.   \n \n NSC did not narrow the scope of its request, but instead  \nfiled a lawsuit challenging the CIA’s response.  The district \ncourt granted summary judgment to the CIA.  NSC II , 960 F. \nSupp. 2d at 163.   We again agree with the district court’s \ndisposition.   \n \n FOIA imposes obligations on agencies to disclose records \nfor requests that “reasonably describe[] such records.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A).  We have explained that agencies “need \nnot honor a request that requires ‘an unreasonably burdensome \nsearch.’”  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. Local 2782 v. U.S. Dep’t USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 5 of 106 \n of Commerce , 907 F.2d 203, 209 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing \nGoland v. CIA , 607 F.2d 339, 353 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).  We have \nalso established that agencies should read FOIA request s “as \ndrafted, not as either agency officials or [the requester] might \nwish it was drafted.”  Miller v. Casey , 730 F.2d 773, 777 (D.C. \nCir. 1984).  The upshot is that, when the request as drafted \nwould require an agency to undertake an unreasonably \nburdenso me search, the agency can decline to process the \nrequest.   \n \n That is what happened here.  As the CIA’s Information \nReview Officer explained in her declaration, “it is difficult to \ndetermine where responsive information would likely be \nlocated within the Agency because the request is so general.”  \nLutz.  Decl. ¶ 31 , 1 J.A. 204 .  “CIA’s records,” she advised, \n“are decentralized and compartmented.  Each directorate . . . \nmust determine which components and/or records systems \nwithin the directorate might reasonably be expected to possess \nrecords responsive to a particular request.”  Id. at ¶ 30.  As a \nresult, “the CIA would be required to search every office for \nany documents containing the word ‘Watson,’” which would \namount to a “massive undertaking.”  Id. at ¶ 31, 1 J.A. 205 . \n \n NSC does not dispute that a search for all documents \nanywhere in the CIA related to “Watson” would be unduly \nburdensome.  NSC instead submits that the CIA gave the \nrequest an “overbroad reading,” in that the request should have \nbeen understood to encompass only “records about how the \ndevelopment of Watson impacted the Intelligence Community, \nspecifically with respect to the application of comparable \nartificial intelligence systems to intelligence analysis.”  NSC \nBr. 27.  The request , though, does not say that .  Instead, it  is \nframed broadly to seek “all [CIA] records pertaining to the \nIBM supercomputer ‘Watson,’” with an added emphasis “to \nconstrue” it “ liberally .”  CIA Request Correspondence, 1 J.A. USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 6 of 107 \n 275.  To be sure, NSC, when askin g for a public -interest fee \nwaiver in its letter transmitting the request , said that responsive \nrecords would “serve as a case study for the CIA’s involvement \nin artificial intelligence research.”  Id. at 277.  But the request \nitself was not so confined, a nd NSC did not refine its request \nafter the CIA invited it to do so.  \n \nThe agency interpreted NSC’s request as drafted, as our \ndecisions direct.  Miller , 730 F.2d at 777.  And the agency and \nthe district court correctly concluded that, as drafted, the \nreque st called for an unreasonably burdensome search.  \n \nIII. \n \nWe next consider a FOIA request submitted by NSC to the \nOffice of Legal Counsel (OLC) in the Department of Justice.  \nThe request sought OLC opinions pertaining to  various statutes \nincluding FOIA itsel f, the Privacy Act, and the Federal Records \nAct.  See NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 119.  OLC  withheld a \nnumber of its responsive opinions under FOIA Exemption 5 \nbased on the attorney -client privilege.  See id. at 119 –20, 196.  \nFor two of the opinions, the district court determined that OLC, \nin other official settings, had referenced the opinions’ legal \nconclusions or conv eyed a summary of the opinions.  Id. at \n197–99.  The court thus ordered OLC to disclose those portions \nof the two opinions that corresponded with the disclosures in \nthe other settings, id. at 199 –200, which OLC did.   \n \nThe district court, in ordering discl osure of those parts of \nthe two opinions, relied on decisions holding that, when \ninformation has been officially acknowledged and voluntarily \ndisclosed in a public domain, “a FOIA plaintiff may compel \ndisclosure of that information even over an agency’s ot herwise \nvalid exemption claim.”  ACLU v. U.S. Dep’t of Def. , 628 F.3d \n612, 620  (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing Wolf v. CIA , 473 F.3d 370, USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 7 of 108 \n 378 (D.C. Cir. 2007)) ; see NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 198 .  The \ndistrict court subsequently rejected NSC’s contention that it  \nwas entitled to the full contents of the two OLC opinions, not \njust the portions corresponding with the official \nacknowledgments.  NSC III , 206 F. Supp. 3d at 288.  NSC now \nrenews its argument that OLC should have been compelled to \nrelease the full conten ts of the two opinions.  We disagree.  \n \nNSC draws a distinction between two potential grounds \nfor compelling disclosure of the full OLC opinions \nnotwithstanding OLC’s assertion of the attorney -client \nprivilege:  (i) the above -referenced “official acknowledg ment” \ndoctrine, under which an agency cannot withhold information \npursuant to any FOIA exemption when there has previously \nbeen a voluntary, official acknowledgment of the information \nto the public, see, e.g. , Wolf , 473 F.3d at 378; and (ii) waiver \nof the attorney -client privilege itself as to the two opinions.  \nNSC does not dispute that, with regard to the first of those \npotential grounds (which it describes as “significantly \nnarrower”), it was entitled to disclosure only of the parts of the \nOLC opinions t hat the district court ordered be disclosed, not \nthe full opinions.  See NSC Br. 52 –53.  NSC’s argument instead \nis that it was entitled to the full OLC opinions because there \nhad been a waiver of the attorney -client privilege.  See id.  \nAccording to NSC, waiver of the attorney -client privilege \ngenerally effects a waiver as to all material relating to the same \nsubject matter, thus requiring disclosure of the full OLC \nopinions.  Id. \n \nWe conclude, though, that there was no waiver of the \nattorney-client privilege with regard to the two OLC opinions.  \nIn the case of  one of the opinions, the waiver ostensibly \noccurred when OLC cited a legal conclusion contained in it in \nthe course of another , publicly  disclosed  opinion.  See NSC II , \n960 F. Supp.  2d at 198.  In the case of  the second OLC opinion, USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 8 of 109 \n the waiver ostensibly occurred when an OLC attorney provided \na “summary of a summary” of the opinion in an interagency \ncommittee meeting.  See id. at 197.  Neither of those events \neffected a waiver of the  privilege with regard to the two \nreferenced opinions.  \n \nWe need not assess whether the nature of the references to \nthe two opinions sufficed to constitute a waiver of the attorney -\nclient privilege.  That is because, in any event, the references \nwere made b y the attorney (OLC), not the client (the agency to \nwhich OLC gave advice).  Disclosure “by the holder” of the \nprivilege can give rise to a waiver, In re Subpoenas Duces \nTecum , 738 F.2d 1367 , 1369  (D.C. Cir. 1984) , and as NSC \nrecognizes, it “is axiomatic t hat the attorney -client privilege is \nheld by the client ,” NSC Br. 53 n.7.  As a result, an “attorney \nis given the power to claim the privilege on behalf of the client \nbut his betrayal of the client’s secret is not treated as a waiver \nof the privilege.”  26A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal \nPractice & Procedure  § 5724  (1st ed. 2020) ; see also  Hanson \nv. USAID, 372 F.3d 286, 29 4 (4th Cir. 2004) (“an attorney may \nnot unilaterally waive the privilege that his client enjoys”);  In \nre Sealed Case , 737 F.2d 94, 98 –99 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (the \nprivilege applies if “not waived by the client”) .  OLC’s own \ndisclosures concerning the two opinio ns at issue, then, did not \neffect a waiver of the attorney -client privilege , at least absent \nany indication (absent here) that OLC was acting on behalf of \nthe client when making the disclosures .  See Hanson , 372 F.3d \nat 294 . \n \nIt is true that the district court, in the course of explaining \nthat there had been an official acknowledgment of the two \nopinions so as to implicate the official -acknowledgment \ndoctrine, went on to say that there had also been a waiver of the \nattorney -client privilege.  See NSC II , 960 F. Supp. 2d at 198.  \nFor the reasons explained, however, we conclude that there was USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 9 of 1010 \n no such waiver in the circumstances.  We therefore have no \noccasion to address whether, if there had been a waiver of the \nprivilege in conne ction with the two opinions,  disclosure of the \nfull opinions would have been necessary as a matter of course .  \nSee In re Sealed Case , 121 F.3d 729, 741  (D.C. Cir. 1997) .  \nRather, because there was no waiver to begin with, we reject \nNSC’s argument that it w as entitled to disclosure of the full \nOLC opinions on a privilege -waiver theory.  \n \n*     *     *     *     *  \n \n NSC advances an array of additional arguments \nconcerning various aspects of district court’s decisions under \nreview.  We have given those arguments careful consideration \nand conclude that the district court did not err in its \ndispositions.  For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district \ncourt’s judgments.  \n \nIt is so ordered.  \n \n \n \n USCA Case #18-5048      Document #1856002            Filed: 08/11/2020      Page 10 of 10",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   Sam Biddle filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request aimed at obtaining records from the Department of Defense related to the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team's use of Google technology, reflecting a nexus with artificial intelligence. The Department withheld approximately 5,000 pages, citing FOIA Exemption 3 related to critical infrastructure security, but failed to provide a satisfactory affidavit to substantiate the exemption. The court denied both parties' summary judgment motions without prejudice, permitting renewed motions with more detailed justifications and requiring the Department to specify all FOIA exemptions it intends to invoke.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether the Department of Defense justified its use of FOIA Exemption 3 to withhold documents concerning the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team’s use of Google technology as “critical infrastructure security information.”\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that the Department of Defense did not provide an adequately detailed affidavit to justify its use of FOIA Exemption 3, resulting in the denial of both parties' summary judgment motions without prejudice.

    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  \n  \nCivil Action No. 23-1380  (TJK)  SAM BIDDLE , \nPlaintif f, \nv. \nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE , \nDefendant . \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \nPlaintiff Sam Biddle submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Department \nof Defense  seeking “ records pertaining to the Algorithmic Warfare Cross -Functional Team’s use \nof Google technology, software or hardware,” from  January 1, 2017 , to March 6, 2018 .  The De-\npartment  identified about 5,000  pages of responsive records , but it withheld th em all under  FOIA \nExemptions 3, 4, 5, and 6.   After several internal remands, the Department affirmed its decision \nto withhold the records .  Biddle sued, and the parties now cross -move for summary judgment.   See \nECF Nos.  14, 17.  \nThe Department argues that the information was properly withheld under Exemption 3, \nwhich exempts information that is specifically exempted from disclosure by statute .  In doing so, \nthe Department  relies on 10 U.S.C. §  130e, which allows  it to withhold “critical infrastructure \nsecurity information.”   The Department does not seek to justify its withholding s under any other \nexemption in its motion, but notes that  it “reserves the right to review and withhold all exempt \ninformation under other applicable exemptions including, but not limited to, FOIA Exemptions 4, \n5, and 6.”   ECF No.  14 at 3 n.2.  In response, Biddle argues that the Department has improperly \ninvoke d Exemption 3 because the relevant sta tute does not apply to the information it withheld, Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 1 of 8 \n 2 the Department’s affidavit is inadequate, and the Department’s segregability analysis is insuffi-\ncient.  He also asserts that he is entitled to summary judgment because the Department has waived \nits right to invoke  the other FOIA exemptions and  that, in any event, those exemptions provide no \nbasis for withholding the information.  \nFor the reasons discussed below, the Court finds that the affidavit  the Department has sup-\nplied does not provide enough information to determine whether it properly applied  Exemption 3 .  \nThus, the Court will deny both parties’ motions for summary judgment without prejudice  and per-\nmit them to file renewed motions  consistent with this Memorandum Order.   Moreover, in any such \nrenewed motion, in the interests of judicial economy, the Department will be required to assert , in \naddition to Exemption 3 , any other exemption that it relies on to withhold the records.  \nIn FOIA cases in which an agency invokes any FOIA exemption, t he “burden is on the \nagency to justify withholding the requested documents, and the FOIA directs district courts to \ndetermine de novo whether non -disclosure was permissible.”  EPIC v. D ep’t of Homeland Sec. , \n777 F.3d 518, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2015) .  When conducting its de novo review, a  court may grant \nsummary judgment based on the agency ’s declarations  if the “affidavit describes the justifications \nfor withholding the information with specific detail, demonstrates that the information withheld \nlogically falls within the claimed exemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence in the \nrecord or by evidence  of the agency's bad faith.”  Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Dep’t of Def. , 628 \nF.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011) .   That is, the agency must provide a “ logical” or “plausible” justi-\nfication for the exemption , Larson v. Dep’t of State , 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009) , and may \nnot rely on “conclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions ,” Morley v. CIA , 508 F.3d 1108, \n1114 –15 (D.C. Cir. 2007) . As the D.C. Circuit explained, agencies must submit  sufficiently de-\ntailed and specific affidavit s for at least three purposes: “ it forces the government to analyze Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 2 of 8 \n 3 carefully any material withheld, it enables the trial court to fulfill its duty of ruling on the applica-\nbility of the exemption, and it enables the adversary system to operate by giving the requester as \nmuch information as possible, on the basis of which h e can present his case to the trial court. ”  \nLykins v. Dep’t of Just. , 725 F.2d 1455, 1463 (D.C. Cir. 1984) .  The withholding agency  “must \ndescribe each document or portion thereof withheld, and for each withholding it must discuss the \nconsequences of disclosing the sought -after information. ”  King v. Dep’t of Just. , 830 F.2d 210, \n223–24 (D.C. Cir. 1987) .  That information “ is necessary to ensure meaningful review of an \nagency ’s claim to withhold information subject to a FOIA request. ”  Id. at 223 . \nThe Department invokes Exemption 3 , which applies to information that is exempted from \ndisclosure by statute .  Unlike other FOIA exemptions, Exemption 3 “ depends less on the detailed \nfactual contents of specific documents; the sole issue for decision is the existence of a relevant \nstatute and the inclusion of withheld material within the statute ’s coverage.”    Morley , 508 F.3d at \n1126 (citation omitted).  As noted, t he Department relies on 10 U.S.C. §  130e, which permits the \nwithholding of  “critical infrastructure security information .”  The statute defines that information \nas:  \nsensitive but unclassified information that, if disclosed, would reveal vulnerabilities \nin Department of Defense critical infrastructure  that, if exploited, would likely re-\nsult in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to Department of \nDefense operations, property, or facilities, including information regarding the se-\ncuring and safeguarding of explosives, hazardous chemicals, or pipelines, related \nto critical infrastructure or protected systems owned or operated by or on behalf of \nthe Department  of Defense, including vulnerability assessments prepared by or on \nbehalf of the Department of Defense, explosives safety information (including stor-\nage and handling), and other site -specific information on or relating to installation \nsecurity.    \n10 U.S.C. § 130 e(f).  \nBut the Department’s affidavit  is not “ furnished with sufficient information ” for the Court \nto decide summary judgment “ in a meaningful fashion .”  King , 830 F.2d  at 223.  It has provided Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 3 of 8 \n 4 almost no specific information about  the 5,000 pages it seeks to withhold  for the Court to determine \nwhether they are in fact “critical infrastructure security information” and qualify for Exemption 3 \nwithholding.   Instead, it supplies a few short paragraphs that rely on generalizations and conclusory \nstatements.  \nOne specific shortcoming with the Department’s affidavit worth highlighting is that it does \nnot explain to what “critical infrastructure” the withheld records relate .  To qualify as “critical \ninfrastructure security information,” the information at issue must, “ if disclosed  . . . reveal vulner-\nabilities in Department of Defense critical infrastructure .”  10 U.S.C. §  130e(f).  The closest the \nDepartment comes is asserting that the information “ individually or in the aggregate, would enable \nan adversary to identify capabilities and vulnerabilities in the Department’s approach to artificial \nintelligence development and implementation .”  ECF No.  14-1 at 4.   The Court is left to wonder \nhow “ the Department’s approach to artificial intelligence development and implementation ” qual-\nifies as “critical infrastructure” under the statute.  Indeed, an “approach” is not usually considered \n“infrastructure.”  In addition, revealing “capabilities” —rather than “vulnerabilities” —does not ap-\npear to move the needle under the statute.  In any event, the Department offers no “specific infor-\nmation ” on this point “ sufficient to place the documents within th [is] exemption category .”  Hay-\nden v. Nat’l Sec. Agency/Cent. Sec. Serv. , 608 F.2d 1381 , 1387  (D.C. Cir. 1979) .  All it provides \nare “broad and vague descriptions” of the information that make it impossible for the Court to \nconduct its requisite de novo review over the Department’s decision to withhold this information \nas “critical infrastructure  security information .”  See Prop. of the People, Inc. v. Off. of Mgmt. & \nBudget , 330 F.  Supp.  3d 373, 388  (D.D.C. 2018) .  \nAside from whether the Department’s “ approach to artificial intelligence development and \nimplementation ” should be considered “critical infrastructure,” the Department’s affidavit  is Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 4 of 8 \n 5 deficient in showing that its withholdings qualify as “critical infrastructure security information” \nin other ways.  For example, the affidavit fails to explain how the disclosure of the withheld infor-\nmation would reveal any alleged “vulnerabilities ” in the critical infrastructure.  See 10 U.S.C. \n§ 130e(f) (requiring that the information must, “ if disclosed  . . . reveal vulnerabilities in Depart-\nment of Defense critical infrastructure .”).1  In many cases , such a connection would be self -evident \n—for example, the statute provides the case of a “ vulnerability assessment ” of a military base .  Id.  \nNot so here.  On this point  too then, the Court has insufficient information to decide whether the \nDepartment has “ demonstrate [d] that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed \nexemption .” Larson , 565 F.3d at 862.2  \nIn short, the overly brief, generalized, and technical (in part) affidavit supplied by the De-\npartment does not enable the Court to fulfill its duty and rule  on the applicability of the asserted \nFOIA exemption.  See Prop. of the People, Inc. , 330 F.  Supp.  3d at 377  (finding the agency’s \ndeclarations “ insufficiently detailed and conclusory, and thus, do not permit the Court to determine \n \n1 To be sure, the affidavit describes a  long list of the types of information in the Depart-\nment’s withholdings.  See ECF No.  14-1 at 4.  But those descriptions do not make up for the defi-\nciencies describe d above .  “Time and again, courts in this Circuit have stressed that the government \ncannot justify its withholdings on the basis of summary statements that merely reiterate legal stand-\nards or offer far -ranging category definitions for information.”  Am. Immigr. Council , 950 \nF. Supp.  2d 221, 235  (D.D.C. 2013)  (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Moreover, the \n“heavy use of technical jargon” in these paragraphs lacks  context that would help the Court eval-\nuate whether the information  meets the standard under the statute.  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. Fed. \nBureau of Investigation , 235 F.  Supp.  3d 207, 216  (D.D.C. 2017); see also King , 830 F.2d at 221 \n(explaining that agency affidavits must have “ adequate representation of context which, when \ncombined with descriptions of deletions, enables de novo review of the propriety of withholding”).  \n2 The Court could go on  to describe  additional deficiencies.  For example, the affidavit \ndoes not sufficiently explain how disclosure of the vulnerabilities at issue , if exploited,  “would \nlikely  result in the significant disruption, destruction, or damage of or to Department of Defense \noperations, property, or facilities .” 10 U.S.C. §  130e(f) (emphasis added).   A “[c]ategorical de-\nscription of redacted material coupled with categorical indication of anticipated consequences of \ndisclosure is clearly inadequate .”  King , 830 F.2d at 224.  Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 5 of 8 \n 6 whether the agency may properly withhold ” the disputed information).3 \nFinally , the Court notes that the Department invokes other FOIA exemptions, including \nExemptions 4, 5, and 6, but does not attempt to justify its withholdings under  them, instead reserv-\ning the right to do so  at another other time , presumably through another motion.  See ECF No.  14 \nat 3 n.2.  While the Court appreciates the Department’s desire to avoid the administrative burden \nof reviewing documents for more exemptions , the piecemeal assertion of different exemptions \n“undermines FOIA ’s purpose to promote ef ficient,  prompt, and full disclosure of information and \nthe interest of judicial economy. ”  Woodward v. U.S. Marshals Serv. , No. 18 -cv-1249 (RC), 2022 \nWL 17961289 , at *8  (D.D.C. Dec. 27, 2022)  (internal quotations and citation omitted).  Indeed, \ndistrict courts retain the discretion to find a defendant’s invocation of FOIA exemptions forfeited  \nif they are not raised timely .  See Shapiro v. Dep ’t of Just ., No. 13 -cv-555 (RDM), 2016 WL \n3023980 , at *4  (D.D.C. May 25, 2016) .  The Court will not exercise  its discretion to do so here, \ngiven the potentially important national security  interests at stake .  Still, the Court advises the \n \n3 The Court also questions  whether the Department has sufficiently  shown that it conducted \nan adequate segregability analysis.  FOIA requires that “[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a \nrecord shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which \nare exempt.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(b).  And while the agency is “entitled to a presumption that [it] \ncomplied with the obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material,” it must still “identify the \nexempt material and provide descriptions of excerpts deemed to be non -segregable, with explana-\ntions as to these decisions.”  Greenpeace, Inc. v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. , 311 F.  Supp.  3d 110, \n132 (D.D.C. 2018) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  “This rule of segregation applies \nto all FOIA exemptions.”  Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv ., 494 F.3d 1106, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  \nThe Department submitted only two sentences in support of its segregability analysis  in which it  \nsimply asserts that it “conducted a page -by-page, line -by-line review of each document and deter-\nmined that no segregation of meaningful  information in the withheld documents can be made.”   \nECF No.  14-1 at 6 .  Courts have found that such conclusory statements, especially with out any-\nthing more —for example, a Vaughn  index —are insufficient for the Department to meet its obli-\ngations.  See Am. Immigr. Council , 950 F.  Supp.  2d at 248 (holding that defendant’s “conclusory \nassertion” that it “reviewed each record line -by-line to identify information exempt from disclo-\nsure . . . will not suffice to discharge this burden”).  \n Case 1:23-cv-01380-TJK   Document 24   Filed 09/13/24   Page 6 of 8 \n 7 Department that when it files its renewed motion, it must address any additional FOIA  exemptions  \nit wishes to invoke .  Cf. Shapiro v. Dep ’t of Just ., 177 F.  Supp.  3d 467 (D.D.C. 2016)  (permitting \nthe FBI “ to assert untimely exemptions to the extent that it can show that the disclosure of such \nrecords  will compromis e national security or sensitive, personal, private information ” (cleaned \nup)).4  \nFor all the above reasons, t he Court finds that  the Department has failed to provide a suf-\nficient basis to justify it withholding s under FOIA’s Exemption 3.  Thus, it will deny the Depart-\nment’s motion without prejudice and permit it to file a renewed motion , which must include all \nexemptions it seeks to invoke, including Exemption 3.  See Jud. Watch, Inc. v.  Dep’t of Just ., 185 \nF. Supp.  2d 54 (D.D.C. 2002) ; see also Jud. Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of Just ., No. 17 -cv-0832 (CKK), \n2019 WL 4644029 , at *9  (D.D.C. Sept. 24, 2019)  (denying agency’s motion without prejudice \nbecause it did not explain in sufficient detail how a FOIA exemption applied but permitting the \nagency to file a second motion due to “ the importance of the exemptions at issue ”).  And because \nthe Court will permit the Department to file a renewed motion, it will similarly deny Plaintiff’s \nmotion without prejudice  and permit him to do the same.  See Prop. of the People, Inc. , 330 \nF. Supp.  3d at 390 ( denying the parties’ motions without prejudice because the agency failed to \nsubmit sufficient information justifying its FOIA withholding s and permitting both parties to file \nrenewed motions).  \nThus , it is hereby  ORDERED  that Defendant ’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF \nNo. 14, and Plaintiff’s Cross -Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No.  17, are DENIED \n \n4 In addition, if necessary  to justify its withholdings,  the Department may seek to provide \naffidavits or other materials to the Court for ex parte, in camera review.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Michael J. Buckner Jr. v. Hilton Global, the court addresses Buckner's motion to recuse the judge on the grounds of alleged impartiality due to a purported conflict of interest involving the judge's spouse's professional affiliations. Buckner's recusal motion is rooted in the assertion that the judge's spouse's business connections indirectly align with defendant interests, raising questions of bias. The court denies Buckner's motion, citing a lack of substantial evidence or timely filing. The case makes mention of Buckner using artificial intelligence in his legal pleadings, which led to citations of nonexistent cases.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether a judge is required to recuse themselves from a case due to a perceived conflict of interest from their spouse’s professional associations, and the implications of inaccurate legal references, potentially generated by AI, within a pro se litigant's filings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Buckner did not meet the burden of establishing that the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). The claims against the judge’s alleged conflict of interest were found to be speculative, and the judge was not necessarily required to recuse themselves due to such remote associations. Furthermore, the court chastised the misuse of AI in generating unsupported legal citations, affirming the need for accurate representations in court filings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Michael Buckner sued Hilton but wasn't happy with how things turned out in court. He asked for the judge to step down from the case, saying the judge might be biased because the judge's husband works with companies like Microsoft, which he thought was a problem. The court said there was no real proof of this being a problem and Buckner's request came too late. Also, Buckner used computer software to help with his arguments, but it led him to make stuff up, which the court didn't like because it wastes everyone’s time. The court told him he needs to be more careful and truthful when making his claims, even if he's doing it without a lawyer.",

Several days after filing  this motion, Buckner filed his Notice of Appeal  [DE 39]  as to \nthis Court’s March 21 , 2025 Memorandum Opinion and Order  [DE 36]  and judgment [DE 37]  \nwhich dismissed the case.1  No response has been filed by Defendants Hilton Worldwide Holdings \nInc. (“Hilton”) or Brian Waller (“Waller”) and the time for doing so has passed.  This matter  is \nripe. For the reasons below, Buckner’s Motion for Recusal  [DE 3 8] is DENIED . \n \n \n1 Filing a notice of appeal with the district court divests the district court of jurisdiction to act in a case, \nexcept on remedial matters unrelated to the merits of the appeal. Fort Gratiot Sanitary La ndfill, Inc. v. \nMich. Dep't of Natural Res.,  71 F.3d 11 97, 1203 (6th Cir. 1995). After the filing of a notice of appeal, the \ndistrict court retains jurisdiction only to enforce the judgment or to “proceed with matters that are in aid of \nthe appeal.” Taylor  v. KeyCorp,  680 F.3d 609, 616 n.8 (6th Cir. 2012) (cit ations omitted).  To be sure, the \ncategory of actions a district court can take in aid of the appellate process is “narrowly defined.” United \nStates v. Sims , 708 F.3d 832, 834 (6th Cir. 2013). It does n ot include “actions that alter  the case on appeal.” \nUnited States v. Carman , 933 F.3d 614, 617 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting Inland Bulk Transfer Co. v. Cummins \nEngine Co. , 332 F.3d 1007, 1013 (6th Cir. 2003)). But here, the district court ruling on the motion to recuse \n(made after the court’s dismissal of the case) does not  alter the case on appeal. Greer v. Strange Honey \nFarm, LLC, 114 F.4th 605, 613 (6th Cir. 2024) . While the Court might also choose  to deny the motion as \nmoot, see Dixon v. Clem , 492 F.3d 665,  680 (6th Cir. 2007)  (“we find no abuse of discr etion in its denying \nDixon's recusal motion as moot ”), for purposes of completeness and transparency the Court addresses the \nmerits.  Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 1 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n Buckner was employed by Tata Consultancy Services Limited, Inc. (“TCS”) .  Buckner’s  \nclaims arise from  an employment dispute which began with  an email exchange between Buckner  \nand Waller and included Hilton employees, third -party contractors, and third -party vendors , \nalthough all wer e using internal “Hilton” email addresses . [DE 12 -1 at 66 -75]. According to \nBuckner , on May 7, 2024, Waller was responsible “for applications under the Migration Program \nmanaged by [Buckner. ]” [DE 31 -1 at 218]. As part of the application review process, Mo nisha \nBhatia wrote “[w]e have started analyzing and we will sync up for any outstanding questions.” \n[Id.]. Buckner replied to Monisha Bhatia’s email, saying “[w]e need a date for the sync up .” [Id.]. \nAnd in response, Waller , an employee of Hilton, sent an email,  which said: “Hello all,  Michael  \n[Buckner ]/ Vaibhav, just wanted to call out the tone in these emails is rather aggressive. Not the \nHilton way. ” [DE 31-1 at 218]. Buckner asserts that the statements “falsely accused [Buckner] of \naggressive misconduct , company misconduct and violation of traditional professionalism.” [DE \n31-1 at 218 -19]. After  receiving this email, Buckner filed suit on May 24, 2024.  [DE 1 -1 at 8 -9]. \n On November 20, 2024, TCS, terminated Buckner’s  employment . Buckner claims that \nprior to termination he had an exemplary performance record, “with no prior disciplinary actions \nor legitimate justification for termination.” [ Id.].  \n Buckner sought to  amend his complaint to ultimately assert  six claims  in total : Defamation  \nagainst Waller , Respondeat Superior  and Neglige nt Supervision  against Hilton , Retaliation , \nWrongful Termination in Violation of Public Policy , and Civil Conspiracy against Hilton and TCS. \n[Id.].  This Court found amendment to add claims of Libel -Defamation against Waller ; Respondeat \nSuperior  and Negligent Supervision Against Hilton ; and Retaliation  and Wrongful Termination in \nViolation of Public Policy  Against Hilton and TSC ; and Civil Conspiracy futile.  In addition, this Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 2 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n Court granted Hilton’s Motion to Dismiss, finding t hat for the same reasons that Buckner’s libel \ndefamation claim was found to be futile regarding his Fourth Amended Complaint, his li bel \ndefamation claim in his original complaint failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted. \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 1 2(b)(6).  The Court also granted Waller’s Motion to Dismiss [DE 28].  The \nCase was then dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.   Buckner timely appealed and the appeal \npending . [DE 39].  \nII. DISCUSSION  \nBuckner now moves for recusal of the undersigned  under 28  U.C.S. § 455(a) on ground s \nthat  \nJudge Jennings’ spouse, Patrick Jennings, is a partner at Commonwealth Alliances, \na lobbying firm with longstanding ties to corporate interests, including Microsoft – \naccompany known for exerting significant political and legal  influence and the \nsubject of multiple defamation claims , including Battle v. Microsoft , a high -profile \ndefamation suit filed in Kentucky.  \n \n[DE 38 at 319].  Buckner then states that “[g]iven the similarity of the issues and the broad \nimplications that  such entities represent in the tech and consulting sectors , this raises not only the \nspecte r of conflict, but the outright stench of partiality . . .” [Id.].  He then asserts  disqualification \nis required under 28 U.C.S. §  455(a).  [ Id.]. \n Buckner sets fort h the “facts” in support of his motions as  \n• The judge’s spouse is a paid lobbyist  with Commonwealth Alliances.  \n \n• Commonwealth Alliances represents or may represent interests aligned with  \nglobal technology and consulting firms – Microsoft among them.  \n \n• Plainti ff’s claims involve defamation and retaliat ion by multinational \ncorporations, including Hilton Worldwide Holdings and Tata Consultancy \nServices (TCS) – entities  whose operations and legal positions may be \ndirectly or indirectly aligned with those of Micros oft and others with ties to \nthe lobbying industry.  \n Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 3 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n [DE 38 at 320].   Buckner then alleges these “connections” create the appearance of partiality that \nis legally intolerable .  No reasonable person could read this arrangement and feel confident that \nthe cou rtroom was free from the shadow of corporate lobbying and institutional favoritism.”  [ Id.]. \n Additionally, Buckner appears to compare his case to Battle v. Microsoft , stating that \n“[j]ust as Microsoft sought to obscure  liability through legal gymnastics a nd reputational  \nmaneuvers, so to o do Hilton and TSC  attempt to minimize and mischaracterize Plaintiff’s very \nreal claims of defamation, retaliation and conspiracy.” [DE 38 at  321].  He then concludes that this \n“convergence of interests between the Defendan ts in this matter and lobbying e cosystem that \nJudge’s Jennings spouse operates within in far too close for comfort – and far too close for \nconstitutional fairness.”  [ Id.]. \n Finally, Buckner chastises the Court for noting that the Plaintiff , likely because  of using \nartificial intelligence, cited to two nonexistent cases in support of his motion and cautioned  the \nPlaintiff that such  citations wasted the opposing party ’s time and money, the Court ’s time and \nresources, and caused “reputational harms to the leg al system. ” Morgan v. Cmty. Against Violence , \nNo. 23 -cv-353-WPJ/JMR, 2023 WL 6976510 , at * 8 (D.N.M. Oct. 23, 2023) .  Buckner asserts that \nbecause he is pro se, such warning have a chilling effect on those who seek access to the legal \nsystem without represe ntation.  [DE 28 at 320 -21]. \nA. Standard  \n“A district judge is presumed to be impartial, and the party challenging such impartiality \nbears ‘the substantial burden of showing otherwise.’” Fharmacy Records v. Nassar , No. 05 -\ncv72126, 2008 WL 4965337, at *3 (E.D. M ich. Nov.18, 2008) (quoting United States v. Denton , \n434 F.3d 1104, 1111 (8th Cir. 2006) and in turn quoting Fletcher v.

Gallion , No. 07 -39(WOB), 2008 WL 1904669, at *2 (E.D. Ky. \nApr. 29, 2008) (citing Liteky v. United States , 510 U.S. 540, 548 (1994)). “[T]he  judge need not \nrecuse himself based on the subjective view of a party no matter how strongly that view is held.” \nId. (quoting United States v. Sammons , 918 F.2d 592, 599 (6th Cir. 1990), and citing United St ates \nv. Burger , 964 F.2d 1065, 1070 (10th Cir. 1 992)). “Indeed, there ‘is as much obligation for a judge \nnot to recuse when there is no occasion for him to do so as there is for him to do so when there \nis.’” Id.; see also  Laird v. Tatum , 409 U.S. 824, 837 (1972) (noting “equal duty” principle”); United \nStates v. Angelus , 258 F. App’x 840 –42 (6th Cir. 2007) (“Although a judge is obliged to disqualify \nhimself when there is a close question concerning his impartiality . . . he has an equally strong duty \nto sit  where disqualification is not required) (inner quotations and citations omitted); Hinman v. \nRogers , 831 F.2d 937, 939 –40 (10th Cir. 1987) (collecting cases); Fharmacy Records v. Nasser , \n572 F. Supp. 2d 869, 876 (E.D. Mich. 2008) (“[W]here the standards go verning disqualification \nhave not been met, disq ualification is not optional; rather, it is prohibited.”) (citation omitted).  \nSection 455(a) of Title 28 provides that a United States judge “shall disqualify himself in \nany proceeding in which his impartiali ty might reasonably be questioned.” 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). \nSection 455(b) designates particularized situations in which recusal is mandated. Union Planters \nBank v. L & J Dev. Co. , 115 F.3d 378, 382 (6th Cir. 1997).  Under §455(c) a judge is under a \nstatutory d uty to “inform himself about his personal and fi duciary financial interests, and make a \nreasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor \nchildren.” 28 U.S.C. § 455(c). “Scienter is not an element of a viola tion of § 455(a),” but \nknowledge is required und er § 455(b). Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp. , 486 U.S. 847, \n859 (1988). A “financial interest” is defined as “ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 5 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n small, or a relationship as direc tor, adviser, or other active participant in the  affairs of a party[.]” \n28 U.S.C. § 455(d)(4). Courts have interpreted “financial interest” to refer to a direct interest, not \na “remote or contingent” interest. In re Virginia Elec. & Power Co. , 539 F.2d 357 , 366 –67 (4th \nCir. 1976); see also Scott , 234 F.  App’x at 357 (“[W]e we hold that ‘disqualification is not required \non the basis of [such] remote, contingent, indirect or speculative interests.’” United States v. \nBayless , 201 F.3d 116, 127 (2d Cir. 2000)).   \nSection  455 “does not require the judge to ‘ac cept as true the allegations made by the party \nseeking recusal.’” Scott , 234 F. App’x at 353 –54 (quoting In re Martinez –Catala , 129 F.3d 213, \n220 (1st Cir. 1997)). Rather, the district court may make the necessary factual findings and decide \nwhether the fa cts warrant disqualification. When considering a § 455 recusal request, “the judge \nis free to make credibility determinations,  assign to the evidence what he believes to be its proper \nweight, and to contradict the evidence with facts drawn from his persona l knowledge.” Id. at 354. \nThe standard under § 455 is objective. Roberts , 625 F.2d at 129. “[A] judge must recuse herself if \na reasonable, objective person, knowing all of the circumstances, would have questioned the \njudge’s impartiality.” Hughes v. United  States , 899 F.2d 1495, 1501 (6th Cir. 1990); see also \nBurley v. Gagacki , 834 F.3d 606, 615 –16 (6th Cir. 2016); United States v. Adams , 722 F.3d 788, \n837 (6th Cir. 2013). Because the standard is objective, the judge need not recuse herself based on \nthe sub jective view of a party. See Sammons , 918 F.2d at 599. As a practical matter, the only basis \nfor establishing bias or prejudic e is an “extrajudicial source.” United States v. Howard , 218 F.3d \n556, 566 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting Liteky , 510 U.S. 540).  \nB. Timelin ess of Buckner’s Motion  \nThe Court must first address the timeliness of Buckner ’s motion. In assessing a motion to \nrecuse, §  455 is subject to “a timeliness requirement.” Layman v. United Parcel Serv., Inc. , No. Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 6 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n 3:17-CV-738-CRS, 2019 WL 3291567, at *1 (W.D . Ky. July 22, 2019) (citing Wright & Miller, \n13D FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE  § 3550 (3d ed. 2019) (collecting cases)). “ This \ntimeliness requirement applies to matters that are public knowledge, even if the movant does not \nin fact know them.” Id. at 2 ( citing Goward v. United States , 569 F. App’x 408, 410 –11 (6th Cir. \n2014)); United States v. Siegelman , 640 F.3d 1159, 1188 ( 11th Cir. 2011) (“The rule has been \napplied when the facts upon which the motion relies are public knowledge, even if the movant \ndoes not know them.”) (citation omitted); United States v. Sypher , No. 3:09 -CR-00085, 2010 WL \n5393849, at *2 (W.D. Ky. Dec. 22,  2010), aff’d, 684 F.3d 622 (6th Cir. 2012). Courts have held \nthat the purpose of this rule “is to ‘conserve judicial resources and prevent a litigant from waiting \nuntil an adverse decision has been handed down before moving to disqualify the judge.’” \nSiegelman , 640 F.3d at 1188 (citing Summers v. Singletary , 119 F.3d 917, 921 (11th Cir. 1997)).  \nHere, Buckner filed his case over a year  ago in May 2024 and it was removed to this Court \nand the undersigned in June 2024 .  On March 21, 2025, this Court entered its final order in this \nmatter and dismiss ed Buckner’s claims.  [DE 36; DE 37].   The information set forth as the “facts” \nregarding M r. Jenni ngs and Commonwealth Alliances are publicly available  on the internet.  \nInformation found from “searching the internet” is public information. Layman , 2019 WL \n3291567, at *1. Moreover, much of the information cited is subject to state ethics report ing \nrequirements  and is summarized by news outlets routinely throughout the year. Accordingly, \nBuckner  had an obligation to bring any legitimate motion to recuse many months ago when the \ncase was assigned to the undersigned , and  not now, after receiving a n adverse  decision . See \nLayman , 2019 WL 3291567, at *1 ; Siegelman , 640 F.3d at 1188 . Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 7 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n The Court finds that Buckner’s many -month  delay  fails to meet the timeliness requirement. \nSee id . Yet the Court will continue to examine the merits of Buck ner’s claims unde r § 455 out of \nan abundance of caution  and transparency.  \nC. Analysis  \nUnder 28 U.S.C. §  455(a), a federal judge must disqualify herself from a proceeding where \nthe judge ’s “impartiality might reasonably be questioned .” 28 U.S.C. §  455(a), Hughes , 899 F.2d \nat 1501 (finding that Sections 144 and 455 are treated the same in the Sixth Circuit). Personal bias \nas used in these sections is “prejudice that emanates from some source other than participation in \nthe proceedings or prior contact with related ca ses.” Fharma cy Records , 572 F. Supp. 2d at 875 \n(quoting United States v. Nelson , 922 F.2d 311, 319 –20 (6th Cir. 1990)). It may be predicated on \nextrajudicial sources such as the judge’s background or associations. Id. Disqualification under \n§ 455(a) and (b) must be pr edicated upon extrajudicial conduct rather than on judicial conduct .” \nKrupansky , 619 F.2d at 578; Youn , 324 F.3d at 423; see generally, Liteky , 510 U.S. 540. “Bias \nfinding its source in the judge’s view of the law or the facts of the case itself is not suf ficient to \nwarrant disqualification.” Fharmacy Records , 572 F. Supp .2d at 875 (citing Story , 716 F.2d at \n1090).  \nHere, the alleged extra judicial conduct which causes the appearance of partiality  appears \nto be  Mr. Jennings ’ representation of either Microso ft, specifically , or multinational  corporations, \ngenerally.   Simply  put, Mr. Jennings does not represent Hilton or Waller or even TSC, as such Mr. \nJennings does not represent any party to the proceeding.  Moreover, Buckner’s case was a \ndefamation and emplo yment matter , and while Buckner asserts that “Com monwealth Alliance s \nrepresents or may represent interests aligned with global technology and consulting firms – \nMicrosoft among them ,” he fails to point to any specific issue or  client related specifically t o his Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 8 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n case or to the defamation or employment issues generally.  Mr . Jennings does not represent \nMicrosoft on any specific issues of defamation or wrongful termination liability  that would have \nany implications here, nor does Buckner point to any.  Moreove r, neither the undersigned nor Mr. \nJennings had any involvement in the  Microsoft case cited by Buckner.  He just generally appears \nto ob ject to the fact that Mr. Jennings represents corporate interests.  This relationship  is far too \ntenuous and simply unre lated to create the appearance of partiality or requ ire recusal.    \nBut, even assuming a closer connection , “[a]s a general proposition, the fact that the spouse \nor the spouse’s business has a business relationship with an entity that appears in an unrelate d \nproceeding before the judge usually does not requi re the judge ’s recusal.” Garrett v. Ohio State \nUniv. , No. 2:18 -CV-692, 2021 WL 7186381, at *5 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 22, 2021), aff’d , No. 21 -3972, \n2023 WL 2012158 (6th Cir. Feb. 15, 2023) (citing Guide to Judi ciary Policy, Vol. 2, Ch. 2, \nAdvisory Opinion No. 10 7). Even still,  \nWhen a judge knows that a client of the judge’s spouse or the spouse’s business \nappears before the judge, the Committee has advised that the judge should evaluate \ncertain factors to deter mine whether recusal is warranted. These factors inc lude: (1) \nthe spouse’s personal role or lack of personal role in providing services to the client,  \n(2) whether the services provided to the client are substantial and ongoing, (3) the \nnature of the client ’s relationship to the spouse or the spouse’s busine ss, and (4) the \nfinancial connection between the client, the business, and the judge's spouse \n(including the percentage of business revenue the client provides and the amount \nof compensation the spouse ea rns from the client). Additionally, judges should \nconsider recusal whenever they become aware of circumstances suggesting that the \nhiring of the spouse or the spouse's business may have been influenced by the \njudge’s position.  \n \nId.  \nNeither Microsoft nor any of Commonwealth Alliances clients  are parties to this litigation. \nNot only are they not parties, but they are also not witnesses in this matter. United States v. Turner , \nNo. CRIM. 05 -02, 2005 WL 3234331, at *1 (E.D. Ky. Nov. 30, 2005). As a result, the  policy \nguidance is not directly appl icable because any connection to Mr. Jennings’ business is farther Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 9 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n removed, yet reviewing the factors further demonstrates that his representation is not grounds for \nrecusal. (1) Mr. Jennings’ clients are not appearing before the undersigned in this case. (2) The \nwork performed by Mr. Jennings for Microsoft ’s and Commonwealth Alliances ’ other clients  is \nentirely unrelated to this case or even the subject matter of this litigation.  (3) Microsoft  and all \nother Commonwealth  Alliances  clients’  relationship to Mr. Jennings’ business is solely through \nan arm’s -length contract for specific services. (4) Microsoft is just one  of approximately 75 clients \nserviced by Mr. Jennings and Commonwealth Alliances from which Mr. Jennings d erives income. \n(5) While Microsoft is a long-time cl ient of Mr. Jennings’ business , it has never been represented \nin relation to any defamation or other employment issues in Kentucky by Mr. Jennings . (6) There \nis no allegation, nor could there be any evide nce, that Mr. Jennings was hired by Micr osoft  because \nof the undersigned’s position , in part due to the fact that the relationship began long before the \nundersigned took the bench . Mr. Jennings and these two clients have an arm’s -length business \nrelationsh ip and no personal relationship. Based o n these factors, there are no grounds for an \nobjective person with knowledge of the facts to question the impartiality of the undersig ned or for \nthe undersigned  to recuse on this basis.  \nD. Use of Artificial Intelligence  by Buckner  \nBuckner ’s motion also chastises the Court for commenting on Buckner’s citation to \nnonexistent case law.  He asserts this has a chilling effect on litigation .  While a chilling effect on \nlitigation is certainly not the intended effect, the Court  cannot permit liti gants to file false or \nmisleading briefs with the Court regardless of whether these falsehoods are made using artificial \nintelligence  (“AI”)  or are simply made -up wholesale.  \nAI programs “are based on complex mathematical systems that lea rn their skills by \nanalyzing enormous amounts of digital data. They do not — and cannot — decide what is true and Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 10 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 \n what is false. Indeed, at times, they just make stuff up —a phenomenon some A.I.  researchers call \nhallucinations.” Cade Metz & Karen Weise, A.I. Is Getting More Powerful, but Its Hallucinations \nAre Getting Worse , N.Y. Times (May 6, 2025), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai -hallucinations -chatgpt -google.html.  As \nsuch, som e courts have rejected the use of such AI programs in legal ple adings “out of hand”. Hunt \nv. Morissette , No. 2 -24-CV-12947 -TGB -APP, 2025 WL 1660358, at *1 (E.D. Mich. June 11, \n2025)  (citing J.G. v. New York City Dep't of Educ. , 719 F. Supp. 3d 293, 308 (S. D.N.Y. 2024) ).  \nAnd while this district has not dismissed AI “o ut of hand” or required disclosures regarding use of \nAI, this Court nonetheless has an obligation to prevent fraud on the court from misuse of this \ntechnology.  \nThe Court accepts a pro se  plaint iff’s allegations as true and “construe[s] filings by pro se  \nlitigants liberally.” Owens v. Keeling , 461 F.3d 763, 776 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Spotts v. United \nStates , 429 F.3d 248, 250 (6th Cir. 2005)). However, while pro se  pleadings are “liberally \nconst rued” and “held to less stringent standards than formal pleadin gs drafted by lawyers,” \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam), pro se  plaintiffs must still satisfy basic \npleading requirements. See Hill v. Lappin , 630 F.3d 468, 470 –71 (6th Cir. 2010) ; Whaley v. \nEquifax Info., Servs., LLC , No. 3:22 -CV-357, 2023 WL 5899845, at *1 , n.1 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 11, \n2023) .  Moreover, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure impose a continuing duty of candor on \nrepresentations made to the court by attorneys and unrepresented parties and authorize sanctions \nfor any viola tion of that duty. Fed. R. Civ. P. 11; see also  Ridder v. City of Springfield , 109 F.3d \n288, 293 (6th Cir. 1997) (discussing continuing duty of candor) ; Metron  Nutraceuticals, LLC v. \nCook , 550 F. Supp. 3d 484, 487 (N.D. Ohio 2021) .  Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 11 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n Additionally, the use o f artificial intelligence can be likened in some ways to ghostwriting . \nDrafting legal documents for a pro se  litigant is often called “ghostwriting” —a practice  the federal \ncourts almost universally condemn. See, e.g. , Evangelist v. Green Tree Servicing, LL C, No. 12 -\n15687, 2013 WL 2393142, at *3 n. 6, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76875, at *11 n.6 (E.D. Mich. May \n31, 2013) (collecting cases). Litigants may proceed pro s e, but the right to undisclosed assistance \nin conducting their case is limited by ethical and pro cedural rules. In re O'Connor , No. 08 -16434, \n2009 WL 1616105, at *3 (N.D. Ohio Feb. 27, 2009); see also  Thigpen v. Banas , No. 08 C 4820, \n2010 WL 520189, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 11, 2010) (recognizing that ghostwriting “on behalf of a \npro se plaintiff raises a serious matter of unprofessional conduct”). These limits exist whether the \nghostwriter is a lawyer, Kircher v. Township of Ypsilanti , No. 07 -13091, 2007 WL 4 557714, at *4, \n2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93690, at *9 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 21, 2007), a non -lawyer, O'Con nor, 2009 \nWL 1616105, at *4, or someone with some legal training, Gordon v. Dadante , No. 1:05 -CV-2726, \n2009 WL 1850309, at *27, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54147, at  *95 (N.D. Ohio June 26, 2009).  \nGhostwriting “evades the requirements” of Rule 11  which is in par t why it is disfavored . Metron \nNutraceuticals, LLC , 550 F. Supp. 3d at 487 (citing Thigpen , 2010 WL 520189, at *1; see also \nEvangelist , 2013 WL 2393142, at *3 n.6, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 76875, at *12 n.6 (noting \nghostwriting violates “the spirit” of Rule 1 1).  In similar fashion, the use of artificial intelligence \nto effectively “ghostwrite” briefs, can allow for violation of the spirit of Rule 11 and creates se rious \nconcerns for maintaining candor to the Court.  Such concerns were directly on display in Bu ckner’s \nbrief, in the citation to nonexistant cases.  \nThe citation to nonexistant case law in support of Buckner’s arguments directly violates \nhis duty of cando r to the Court. Further,  “[q]uite obviously, many harms flow from such \ndeception —including wastin g the opposing party ’s time and money, the Court's time and Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 12 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>13resources, and reputational harms to the legal system (to name a few). ”Morgan , No. 23 -cv-353-\nWPJ/JMR, 2023 WL 6976510, at *8).\nAs stated previously, while the Court recognizes that Buckner is pro se , his status will not \nbe tolerated as an excuse for citing nonexistent case law or violating his duty of candor to the court . \nIn addition, itis well established that “judicial rulings alone almost never constitut e a valid basis \nfor a bias or partiality motio n.”Liteky , 510 U.S. at555. Instead, they are proper “grounds for \nappeal, not for recusal. ” Id.  This Court’ s opinion pointing out Buckner ’scitation to nonexistent \ncase law, along with its implications, is an issue for appeal and not a valid basis for recusal.  \nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the Court, having considered the Buckner’s motion and related filings and \nbeing otherwise sufficiently advised, IT IS ORDERED that Buckner’s Motion for Recusal [DE \n38] is DENIED.\ncc: Plaintiff, pro se \nJune 18, 2025Case 3:24-cv-00375-RGJ     Document 45     Filed 06/20/25     Page 13 of 13 PageID #:\n<pageID>",

The plaintiff's claims involved complex and unintelligible allegations regarding legal status, financial entitlements, and interactions with federal agencies, including the FBI and claims relating to \"Artificial Intelligence.\" The court deemed the allegations as lacking credible legal or factual basis, meriting a dismissal with prejudice.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff's complaint presented any arguable legal basis or credible factual claim that could entitle her to relief against the United States Department of the Treasury.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the complaint should be dismissed with prejudice as it is frivolous, lacking any credible legal basis or factual support, despite the court's obligation to liberally construe pro se pleadings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone went to court saying they owned all the money in America and had secret agreements with the government and its agencies, but when they tried to explain why, their story sounded nonsensical and didn't follow any clear rules or laws.

Upon review of the relevant pleadings \nand applicable law, and for the reasons that follow , this case should be  summarily  DISMISSED  \nWITH PREJUDICE  as frivolous.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \n On March 26 , 2018 , Plaintiff , a pro se litigant and self -described homeless Dallas \nresident,  filed the instant  Complaint  against the United States Department of the Treasury .  Doc. \n3; Doc. 5 .  Subsequently, she filed pleadings titled Petition for Writ of Mandamus , Doc. 8 , \nAdditional Evidence , Doc. 9 , and Petition for Writ of  Mandamus and Request for Petition to \nSeal, Doc. 10 .  The Court advised Plaintiff that her pleadin gs did not meet the basic  requirements \ndictated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a), and ordered her to submit an amended \ncomplaint .  Plaintiff instead filed another pleading titled Petition for Writ of Mandamus , Doc. 14 , \nand several motions for default judgment and to seal this case, Doc. 12 ; Doc. 13 ; Doc. 17 ; Doc. \n20; Doc. 21 .                                                                                          \n Case 3:18-cv-00719-N-BK   Document 22   Filed 06/20/18    Page 1 of 6   PageID <pageID> \n \n \n2 \n Plaintiff’s pleadings are difficult to decipher and nonsensical.  By her complaint, Plaintiff \nrequests that all “powers of attorney . . . be restored to me as a Native American under Title [10 \nsect. 1151] & my uniform commercial code filings . . . .”  Doc. 3 at 1 .  Throughout the 44 -page \nattachment  to the complaint , Plaintiff repeatedly states, “I am a Foreign Principal to the U.S. \nInc., and I have a Uniform Commercial Code Registration on file with the Secretary of State for  \nan amount of Unlimited credits.”  Doc. 3 at 3 . \n By way of further example, in her Petition for Writ of  Mandamus and Request for \nPetition to Seal , Plaintiff asserts : \nI AM A LIVING WOMAN, A NATIVE TO THE LAND AND JURE REGALIA IS  REVOKED \nUNDER UCC 2A -505, FOR COMMERCIAL DISHONOR 3 -501 BECAUSE  ONLY THE \nLIVING CAN CONTRACT UNDER FEDERAL TITLE 42 U.S.C. 1981, NOT  A \nCOMMERICAL FRANCHISE - WHICH IS USED AS THE SURETY FOR PAYMENTS  \nATTACHED T O THE UCC CONTRACT TRUST ACCOUNT - WHICH WAS CREATED  BY \nFRAUD UNDER THE BABY MILLER'S ACT, SHEPPARD TOWNER'S ACT,  AMONG \nOTHER THINGS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE TO PURPORT  FOR THE \nNATIONAL DEBT BY FORMS USED KNOWN AS IFAS.  \n \nI MODIFIED ALL THESE CONSTRUC TION CONTRACTS TO NON -CONSTRUCTION  \nAND I OWN THEM, BONDS, AND ALL US TREASURY ACCOUNTS, AND  \nCOMMERCIAL ENTRIES ATTACHED TO MY SERIAL NUMBERS.

Jure Regalia revoked and Sui Juris invoked. These contracts were \ncreated under the Baby  Miller's Act by Fraud originated at The Bureau of Fiscal \nServices in signed Contracts by s omeone not my Fiduciary appointed or my \nguardian. My Executor is not the United States  of America, he is a living man, and \nmy Bond Modifications are to be HONORED here in  this public agency the same, \nto the Crown. I am a free Native American woman and the  Federal Reserve in \nChicago released my acco unts for UNRESTRICTED and OPEN Use  which is \nconnected to my UCC Contact Trust account authenticated By the FBI and UCC  \nContact Tr ust Division in Washington D.C.  \n \nI am being protected by the USSS, The Military, and the FBI, in Washington and  \nDowntown Dallas , please contact the Special Agent in Charge, The Mr. Eric \nJackson for  questions or concerns, forever. I am very important to people in the \nFBI, The Federal  Government, and Congress. I am to participate in philanthropy \nforever and help law  enforcement beca use I am a Federal Agent and I work for the \nFederal Reserve in Chicago  with Mrs. Knopse to help people who are below the \npoverty limit - she already accepted my  modifications of contract along with The \nMr. Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury in  March of 2017.  \n \nDoc. 17 at 1 -2. \n Plaintiff’s remaining pleadings allege similar unintelligible claims re garding the FBI, \n“Artificial Intelligence, ” the UCC, the U.S. Treasury Department  and other government \nagencies .  Doc. 21 at 1 ; Doc. 21 at 1 -2.    \nII. ANALYSIS  \nBecause Plaintiff is proceeding in forma pauperis , her complaint is subject to screening \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) .  That statute provides for the sua sponte dismissal of a                                                                                          \n Case 3:18-cv-00719-N-BK   Document 22   Filed 06/20/18    Page 3 of 6   PageID <pageID> \n \n \n4 \n complaint if the Court finds that it (1) is frivolous or malicious, (2) fails to state a claim upon \nwhich relief may be granted, or (3) seeks monetary relief against a  defendant who is immune \nfrom such relief.  A complaint is frivolous when it “lacks an arguable basis either in law or in \nfact.”   Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989) .  A court may dismiss a complaint as \nfrivolous when it is based on an indisputable meritless legal theory or when the factual \ncontentions are “clearly ‘baseless.’”  Denton v. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 32 (1992) .  The latter \ncategory encompasses allegations that describe “fanciful, fantas tic, and delusional” scenarios, or \nthat “rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible.”  Id. at 33 .   \nThe Court must always liberally construe pleadings filed by pro se  litigants.  See \nErickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007)  (noting  pro se pleadings “must be held to less \nstringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers”); Cf. FED. R. CIV. P. 8(e) \n(“Pleadings must be construed so as to do justice.”).   Even under this most liberal construction, \nhowever, Plaintiff’s factual contentions are legally and factually frivolous . \nFirst, Plaintiff’s claims lack an arguable basis in law.  Plaintiff has presented no \nsupporting legal authority for the claims she asserts.  Second, her f actual contentions are clearly \nbaseless , as she has not present ed a logical set of facts to support any claim for relief.  See \nDenton , 504 U.S. at 33 .  Moreover, her alleg ations of involvement with the FBI, the Federal \nReserve , “Artificial Intelligence ,” and other federal agencies  are not rational or credible.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiff’s complaint should be d ismiss ed with prejudice as frivolous.1   \n  \n                                                           \n1 The Court recently dismissed with prejudice another pro se action filed  by Plaintiff , finding that \nthe complaint lacked a logical set of facts .  See Armbrister v. Velasquez , No. 3:18-CV-841-G-BN \n(N.D. Tex. Apr. 18, 2018)  (accepting magistrate judge’s recommendation).                                                                                           \n Case 3:18-cv-00719-N-BK   Document 22   Filed 06/20/18    Page 4 of 6   PageID <pageID> \n \n \n5 \n \nIII. LEAVE TO AMEND  \n Ordinarily, a pro se p laintiff should be granted leave to amend h er complaint prior to \ndismissal.  However, leave to amend is not required whe n plaintiff “has already pleaded his ‘best \ncase. ’”  Brewster v. Dretke,  587 F .3d 764, 767 -68 (5th Cir. 2009) .  As discussed herein, As \nexplained herein, Plaintiff ’s claim s (as best the Court can decipher them) are fatally infirm .  \nThus , granting leave to amend under these circumstances would be futile and cause needless \ndelay.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reaso ns, Plaintiff’s complaint should be summarily DISMISSED  \nWITH PREJUDICE  as frivolous .  See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) .    \nSO RECOMMENDED , June 20, 2018 . \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n                                                                                           \n Case 3:18-cv-00719-N-BK   Document 22   Filed 06/20/18    Page 5 of 6   PageID <pageID> \n \n \n6 \n \nINSTRUCTIONS FOR SERVICE AND  \nNOTICE OF RIGHT TO APPEAL/OBJECT  \n \n A copy of this report and recommendation will be served on all parties in the manner \nprovided by law.  Any party who objects to any part of this report and recommendation must file \nspecific written objections within 14 days after being served with a copy.   See 28 U.S.C. § \n636(b)(1) ; FED. R. CIV. P. 72(b).  To be specific, an objection must identify the finding or \nrecommendation to which objection is made, state the basis for the objection, and indicate  the \nplace in the m agistrate judge’s report and recommendation where the disputed determination is \nfound.  An objection that merely incorporates by reference or refers to the briefing before the \nmagistrate judge is not specific.  Failure to file specific written objections w ill bar the aggrieved \nparty from appealing the factual findings and legal conclusions of the magistrate judge that are \naccepted or adopted by the district court, exc ept upon grounds of plain error .  See Douglass v. \nUnited Services Automobile Ass’n , 79 F.3d 1415, 1417 (5th Cir. 1996) , modified by statute on \nother ground s, 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)  (extending the time to file objections to 14 days).   \n                                                                                          \n Case 3:18-cv-00719-N-BK   Document 22   Filed 06/20/18    Page 6 of 6   PageID <pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Vincent Michael Marino filed a lawsuit against multiple U.S. government agencies under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act, seeking documents related to an alleged operation involving the surgical implantation of electronic devices in his body. Marino claimed these devices were used for advanced surveillance and research, involving technologies such as artificial intelligence, satellite tracking, and quantum computing. The court dismissed the complaint as frivolous and devoid of merit due to the fantastical nature of the allegations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the federal court has jurisdiction to entertain Marino's claims based on his allegations of being implanted with surveillance devices by government agencies.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, finding that Marino's claims were \"wholly insubstantial and frivolous\" and amounted to a \"fantastic scenario\" of government manipulation that is clearly fanciful.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A man named Vincent Marino accused various government bodies of secretly implanting spying devices in his body during surgery. He wanted them to give him records about this wild claim. The court, however, said his story was just too unbelievable and dismissed his case because there was no real evidence to support such a bizarre notion.",

Pl.’s Opp’n ¶ 6.   \nThe C omplaint will be dismissed  under  Rule 12(b)(1 ) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure.  “[F]ederal courts are without power to entertain claims otherwise within their \njurisdiction if they are ‘so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit,’ \nNewburyport Water Co. v.

Ross , 215 U.S. \n70, 80 (1909).”   Hagans v. Lavine , 415 U.S. 528, 536- 37 (1974).  “A dismissal on this ground is \nwarranted only ‘where [] a claim is wh olly insubstantial and frivolous.’”  Fiorani v.

His \nscenario is “clearly fanciful .”  Id. at 331.   Complaints seeking access to information from the \nfederal government are subject to dismissal where  the plaintiff’s stated belief that the relevant \nagency maintains the information sought is factually frivolous.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   The plaintiff, Lance Black, objected to a Magistrate Judge's decision denying his application to use AI transcription software for conducting depositions via video. He claimed this method would help reduce costs. However, the court overruled the objections, primarily due to concerns over confidentiality and the untested nature of the AI transcription method.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n   The central legal issue is whether the use of AI transcription software for depositions is permissible under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically concerning the accuracy and confidentiality of the transcripts.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n   The court upheld the Magistrate Judge's decision, emphasizing that significant concerns about the integrity and security of the information shared with AI transcription services justified denying the plaintiff's request. They found no conflict with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or an overreach of judicial discretion.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n   Imagine you want to use a new, cheaper app to record a conversation that needs to be super accurate and private. The court said no because they were worried that the app might not keep the conversation private or transcribe it correctly since it’s an untested method for such an important job.

Case No.:  3:21-cv-01990 -RBM -JLB \n \nORDER  OVERRULING \nPLAINTIFF’S OBJECTIONS   \n \n[Doc . 173] \n \n On May 2, 2025, Magistrate Judge Jill L. Burkhardt issued an Order Denying \nPlaintiff’s Application for Leave to Conduct Deposition by Video and to Prepare Transcript Using Voice Recognition Technology (“Magistrate Judge Decision”).  (Doc. 172.)  On \nMay 14, 2025, Plaintiff Lance Black filed an Objection to Order Denying Plaintiff’s \nApplication for Leave to Conduct Deposition by Video and to Prepare Transcript Using Voice Recognition (“Objections”).  (Doc. 173.)  On May 27, 2025, Defendants filed a \nResponse to Plaintiff’s Objections (“Response”) .  (Doc. 174.)  Plaintiff filed an Opposition \nto Defendant’s Response to Plaintiff’s Objection s (“Reply”) on June 2, 2025.  (Doc. 17 5.)   \nFor the reasons outlined below, Plaintiff’s Objections to the Magistrate Judge’s \nDecision are OVERRULED .   \nI. BACKGROUND  \nThe Magistrate Judge’s Decision accurately summarizes the briefing filed by the \nparties and identifies the status conferences held (Doc. 172 at 2– 3) to address Plaintiff’s Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 178     Filed 07/10/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 1 of 10 \n2 \n3:21-cv-01990 -RBM-JLB  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Application for Leave to Conduct Deposition by Video and to Prepare Transcript Using \nVoice Recognition Technology According to Rule 30(b)(3)(A) (“ Plaintiff’s Application”) \n(Doc. 153).  Plaintiff’s Application was fully briefed, including supplemental briefing ordered by the Magistrate Judge to address specific issues, and a status conference .  (Docs. \n160, 162 –166, 168, 170– 171.)   \nPlaintiff seeks to conduct at least 13 depositions using artificial intelligence (“AI”) \nsoftware and a notary public and videographer, Casey Stark, to prepare  and certify the \ndeposition transcripts.  (Doc. 173- 1 at 5; Doc. 153 at 1– 2.)  Plaintiff  also requests “[t]hat \nthe transcripts produced by Mr. Stark, so long as produced according to Rule 30, may be \nsubmitted as ‘transcripts’ for all purposes, including motions, the pretrial requirements of \nRule 26, and at trial itself.”  (Doc. 153 at 2.)  As the Magistrate Judge explained, Plaintiff is “essentially indigent,” and he hopes to reduce his expense for each remaining d eposition \nfrom approximately $4,000 to $1,500 by using Mr. Stark to create and certify the \ndepositions.  (Doc. 172 at 4 (citing Doc.153 at 3, 5).)  \nIn their Response to Plaintiff’s Objections, Defendants reiterate that they “do not \noppose Mr. Stark acting as a videographer or deposition officer.”  (Doc. 174 at 2.)  They \nalso note that they “do not interpret the Magistrate Judge’s [Decision] as disallo wing the \nability of Mr. Stark to serve in those roles.”  ( Id.)  However, Defendants do continue to \n“oppose utilizing the AI program for creating, and Mr. Stark certifying, the deposition \ntranscript.”  ( Id.) \nII. LEGAL STANDARD S \nA district c ourt’s review of a non- dispositive decision by a magistrate judge is \nlimited.  “The district judge in the case must consider timely objections and modify or set \naside any part of the order that is clearly erroneous or is contrary to law.”  Fed. R. Civ.

Apr. 5, 2022)  (citations \nomitted).  “The ‘ clearly erroneous ’ standard, which applies to a magistrate judge ’s findings \nof fact, is ‘significantly deferential, requiring a definite and firm conviction that a mistake \n[h]as been committed. ’”  Thai, 2022 WL 1017888, at *3 (quoting Concrete Pipe & Prods. \nv. Constr. Laborers Pension Tr. , 508 U.S. 602, 623 (1993) ).   \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nPlaintiff argues:  (1) the Magistrate Judge’s Decision is contrary to the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure because it interferes with his ability to conduct this case inexpensively; (2) the Magistrate Judge exceeded her jurisdiction in finding Mr. Stark was not qualified \nto be the deposition officer under the terms proposed by Plaintiff; (3) the Magistrate \nJudge’s Decision is contrary to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the \nappointment of a deposition officer, the conduct of a deposit ion, and t he preparation of a \ntranscript; (4) Defendants waived the issue of confidentiality; and (5) the number of \ndepositions Plaintiff is taking should not be considered.  Because the Court finds the \nMagistrate Judge’s Decision does not conflict with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or exceed the Magistrate Judge’s jurisdiction and confidentiality and the number of \ndepositions were properly considered, Plaintiff’s Objections are overruled.  \nA. The Magistrate Judge’s Decision Does Not Conflict with the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure  \nPlaintiff seeks to conduct depositions using a notary public and videographer , Mr. \nStark,  as the deposition officer and for Mr. Stark to “prepare and certify the deposition Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 178     Filed 07/10/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 3 of 10 \n4 \n3:21-cv-01990 -RBM-JLB  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 transcript, aided by AI transcription software.”  (Doc. 173- 1 at 5.)  Plaintiff argues that \nbecause Federal Rul es of Civil Procedure 1 and 30 (b)(3)(A)  provide for the inexpensive \nconduct of litigation, the Magistrate Judge’s Decision denying Plaintiff ’s Application  to \nconduct these depositions by a less  expensive method is “clearly contrary to the law.”   (Id. \nat 7.)  Plaintiff also asserts in his objection  that because Rule 26(b)(2)(A) only specifies \nthat courts may limit the number of depositions and interrogatories and the length of \ndepositions, imposing any other limit on how a deposition is conducted is contrary to the \nlaw.  ( Id. (citing Rule 26(b)(2)(A).)  For the reasons set forth below,  the Court overrules \nthese objections .   \nRule 1 provides that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “ govern the procedure in \nall civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts” and “ should be \nconstrued, administered, and employed by the court and the parties to secure the just, \nspeedy, and inexpensive determination of every action and proceeding. ”   \nRule 30(b)(3)(A) states:  \n(3) Method of Recording.  \n (A) Method Stated in the Notice.  The party who notices the \ndeposition must state in the notice the method for recording the \ntestimony.  Unless the court orders otherwise, testimony may be \nrecorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means.  The \nnoticing party bears the recording costs.  Any par ty may arrange \nto transcribe a deposition.  \n \nRule 26(b)(2)(A) states:  \n(2) Limitations on Frequency and Extent.  \n(A) When Permitted.   By order, the court may alter the limits \nin these rules on the number of depositions and interrogatories or \non the length of depositions under Rule 30.  By order or local \nrule, the court may also limit the number of requests under Rule \n36. \n \nIf the Court were to interpret Rule 1, Rule 30(b)(3)(A), and Rule 26(b)(2)(A) as \nPlaintiff suggests in his Objections —prohibiting a magistrate judge from imposing Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 178     Filed 07/10/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 4 of 10 \n5 \n3:21-cv-01990 -RBM-JLB  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 parameters on a party’s preferred method of creating and certifying a deposition to reduce \nthe expense —the n a magistrate judge could never impose any limitation or restriction \nwhatsoever on how a deposition is recorded, transcribed, or certified.  (Doc. 173 -1 at 7 \n(citing Lucas v. Curran, 62 F.R.D. 336, 337 (E.D. Pa. 1974)).  Followed to its logical \nconclusion,  a magistrate judge would always have to accept a party’s less expensive \nmethod regardless of legitimate concerns raised by an opposing party.  The C ourt is not \npersuaded this is  a reasonable interpretation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, \nparticularly given the broad discretion given to magistrate judges to manage discovery.  \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)  (Discovery Scope and Limits).  \nAdditionally , the sentence in Rule 30(b)(3)(A)  addressing how a deposition is \nrecorded begins with “[u]nless the court orders otherwise .”  This is consistent with a \njudge’s discretion to impose limits on how discovery is conducted, including as to \ndepositions.  This case itself illustrates why a court might “order[] otherwise.”  Rule \n30(b)(3)(A).  An opposing party has identified numerous legitimate concerns with having many  depositions —at least 13— taken and certified by an untested method that raises \nconcerns in the handling of confidential information subject to a Protective Order.  (Doc. \n172 at 23, 5– 7.)  The Magistrate Judge’s denial of Plaintiff’s Application was not contrary \nto law and this objection is overruled.  \nB. The Magistrate Judge Did Not Exceed Her Jurisdiction  or Violate the \nRules Regarding a Deposition Officer or the Enabling Act\n1 \nPlaintiff argues the Magistrate Judge exceeded her jurisdiction  and violated the \nFederal Rules, including the Rules Enabling Act,  in deny ing his request because the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure do not dictate the qualifications, the level of experience, or the \nmethods by which depositions are conducted and transcripts certified.  (Doc. 173- 1 at 7 –\n14.)  Plaintiff quotes limitations identified in the Magistrate Judge’s Decision regarding \n \n1 Given the overlap in these two sections of Plaintiff’s Objections, the Court addresses them \ntogether.   Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 178     Filed 07/10/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 5 of 10 \n6 \n3:21-cv-01990 -RBM-JLB  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Mr. Stark’s experience and then characterizes these as  improper  “requirements” imposed \nby the Magistrate Judge that are  incompatible with the Federal Rules minimal requirements \nthat a deposition be taken before for a deposition officer able  to administer oaths.  ( Id. at \n8–9 (“These critiques are entirely incompatible with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \n28, 29, 30, and 32.”).)  Plaintiff  asserts that a judge  cannot impose any limitation on who \nconducts, creates, and certifies a deposition —even when num erous challenges are raised \nby an opposing party —because no Rule specifies  those limitations.  ( Id. at 8–12; see also  \nDoc. 172 at 5 (Magistrate Judge’s Decision identifying Defendants’ many challenges to \nMr. Stark creating and certifying transcripts because of confidentiality concerns with the \nAI platform as well as concerns regarding the accuracy of a deposition created and certified \nas proposed).)  Plaintiff  asserts the Magistrate Judge’s Decision constitutes the creation of \na rule that conflicts with the  Federal Rules.  (Doc. 173-1 at 12 –14.)  Plaintiff also asserts \nthat his proposal sufficiently addresses the concerns raised regarding the accuracy and \nclarity of the record.  (Doc. 173 -1 at 10 –12.)    \nThe Court is not persuaded that the Magistrate Judge’s discussion of the limitations \nin Mr. Stark’s experience  and qualifications, issues raised by Defendants, constitute the \ncreation and implementation of improper requirements for a deposition officer.  Rather, the \nMagistrate Judge thoroughly consider ed Mr. Stark’s background and experience to \ndetermine whether Plaintiff’s less -expensive proposal for the creation and certification of \nat least 13 depositions will work in this particular case .  (Doc. 172 at 6–7.)  For example, \nafter summarizing Mr. Stark’s proposed method of training the AI program in real time \nthrough modifications  made as testimony is being taken, the Magistrate Judge fairly \nconcludes that “this practice is untested in a real- life deposition setting and could lead to \nunanticipated delays and problems .”2  (Id. at 6.)  This is not the creation of a requirement \n \n2 The potential for “delays and problems” is particularly problematic in this case given the \noriginal fact discovery deadline , extended multiple times, was more than six months ago.  \n(Doc. 88 at 1 (initial Scheduling Order).)   Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 178     Filed 07/10/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 6 of 10 \n7 \n3:21-cv-01990 -RBM-JLB  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 that Mr. Stark have certain prior experience.  It is the recognition that an untested method \nfor the creation, the transcription, and the certification of deposition transcripts using an \nAI platform  that raises “legitimate concerns” regarding confidentiality is not a permissible \noption for Plaintiff’s remaining 13 depositions in this case.    \nAs the Magistrate Judge acknowledged here, there may be cases and circumstances \nthat would warrant  depositions being  taken as Plaintiff  proposes.  (Doc. 172 at 7 n.1 (“This \nis not to say that Mr. Stark, or someone else with his experience and skills, aided by AI \ntranscription software, would not be an appropriate deposition officer in a different  case.  \nFor all the reasons addressed in this order, though, this is not the right case.”) .  Here, \nhowever, the Magistrate Judge properly denied the request to cond uct 13 depositions in \nthis case in a way that was untested and raised concerns as to accuracy and maintaining \nconfidentiality.  Accordingly, these objections are overruled.  \nC. Confidentiality  \nPlaintiff asserts that Defendants have “waived the issue of confidentiality” by not \ndesignating prior depositions as confidential and by their own use of  a third -party  platform \nto transmit file s.  (Doc. 173- 1 at 14 ; Doc. 174 at 8 –10.)  Plaintiff also asserts that, to the \nextent the Magistrate Judge “gave any weight to the City of San Diego’s Artificial \nIntelligence and Generative Artificial Intelligence Policy when forming its decision, that \npolicy should not bear any weight, as fede ral law should control.”  (Doc. 173 -1 at 14 –15.)   \nThe Magistrate Judge assessed Defendants’ challenges as to confidentiality to be \nlegitimate, discussed the AI platform’s disclaimer on the use of the data, and concluded \nthat providing information designated as confidential under the terms of the Protective Order to the AI platform  when it is unclear “how the information will be stored and used, \nviolates the Protective Order and is not justified in this case.”  (Doc. 172 at 7 –8.)  This \nconsideration  of confidentiality, among other reasons for denying Plaintiff’s Application, \nis not contrary to law  or clearly erroneous.  See Thai, 2022 WL 1017888, at *3  (defining \ncontrary to law as applying “ an incorrect legal standard, misapply[ying]  the applicable \nstandard, or fail[ing]  to consider an element of the applicable standard” and defining clearly Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 178     Filed 07/10/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 7 of 10 \n8 \n3:21-cv-01990 -RBM-JLB  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 erroneous as requiring a “definite and firm conviction that a mistake [h] as been \ncommitted. ”) (citations omitted) .  The Magistrate Judge appropriately considered \nDefendants’ challenges to confidentiality in using the AI platform  and found its use would \nviolate the Protective Order.  This analysis and conclusion are not contrary to law and there \nwas no mistake committed in reaching this conclusion.  \nDefendants not designating prior depositions confidential is not a broad waiver of \nconfidentiality as to these 13 remaining depositions.   The limited authority relied on by \nPlaintiff for this assertion is distinguishable.  In Richmark Corp. v. Timber Falling \nConsultants , the court found a party waived a specific objection to discovery requests and \ninterrogatories by not raising the objection in response to the initial discovery requests, or \nin response to a motion to compel, or in response to a motion to st ay discovery, or before \nthe Ninth Circuit.  959 F.2d 1468, 1473 (9th Cir. 1992).  The issue was first raised in a \nreply brief on imposition of contempt sanctions and the court found at that point, the \nobjection was waived.  Id.   Here, Plaintiff’s Application sought to take 13 depositions a \nparticular way and to obtain approval for the use of these depositions for motions and trial.  \n(See supra  Section  I.)  Defendants opposed Plaintiff’s proposal based on confidentiality \nconcerns, among many other issues.  ( Id.)  Defendants did not waive a challenge to the \nsubmission of confidential information to the AI platform as proposed by Plaintiff because \nthis was the first time it was proposed.  And, to the extent Plaintiff is arguing Defendants \nbroadly waived all confidentiality challenges as to anything that might arise in the \nremaining 13 depositions because they did not designat e the prior four depositions as \nconfidential, the Court is not persuaded.   Plaintiff has not provided any authority for the \nproposition that Defendants’ waiver, to the extent there was any, could be  that broad.  As \nnoted above, Richmark  Corp. , the only case cited by Plaintiff, is distinguishable because it \ninvolved specific challenges that were not raised through numerous stages of litigation.  \n959 F.2d at 1473.    \nSimilarly, Defendants’ use of a third- party cloud service to transmit information \ndoes not constitute a waiver of all confidentiality challenges in Plaintiff’s use of an AI Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 178     Filed 07/10/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 8 of 10 \n9 \n3:21-cv-01990 -RBM-JLB  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 platform to transcribe or record depositions.  Plaintiff asserts that “[b]y providing \ninformation designated as confidential to Google Drive, Defendants should be considered \nto have waived the issue.”  (Doc. 173- 1 at 14 ; see also Doc. 175 at 8– 10.)  Essentially, \nPlaintiff is asserting that because Defendants have used a different third- party service in a \nway that might have confidentiality concerns similar to Plaintiff’s use of an AI platform, \nthe Court should find Defendants have waived all confi dentiality challenges regarding the \nAI platform ’s use for depositions.  While these services or platforms both involve third-\nparty platforms and might both raise confidentiality concerns, Plaintiff cites no authority \nfor the proposition that Defendant’s use of Google Drive constitutes a waiver as to all \nconfidential information.   \nThe Court is also not persuaded there was any error in consideration of the City’s \nArtificial Intelligence and Generative Artificial Intelligence Policy.  Plaintiff seems to suggest that the Magistrate Judge applied the City’s Policy,  instead of federal law,  to \ndetermine what is and is not confidential.   However, the Magistrate Judge does not rely on \nthe City’s Policy as a basis for deny ing Plaintiff’s Application.  The Magistrate Judge’s \nDecision acknowledges Defendants’ arguments regarding the prohibition s in the City’s \nPolicy regarding the submission of confidential information to AI platforms without \nappropriate controls (Doc. 172 at 5) , but the denial does not rely on violation of the Policy  \n(id. at 7–8).  It relies on the information being submitted to an AI platform being \nconfidential and a violation  of the Protective Order.  (Id. )   \nPlaintiff’s objections regarding confidentiality and consideration of the City’s Policy \nare overruled.  \nD. Consideration of the Number of Depositions  \nPlaintiff objects that the “number of depositions is not at issue and any ruling should \nnot consider it.”  (Doc. 173- 1 at 15.)  Plaintiff asserts that the number cannot be considered \nbecause no prior objection was made to the number of depositions and the parties’ discovery plan provided for Plaintiff to take 26 total depositions.  ( Id.)   Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 178     Filed 07/10/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 9 of 10 \n10 \n3:21-cv-01990 -RBM-JLB  1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 The Magistrate Judge’s consideration of the number of depositions and their \nnecessity was not clearly erroneous or contrary to law.  To the extent the Magistrate Judge \neven relies on the number of depositions in deny ing Plaintiff’s Application,3 these are  \npermissible considerations.  If there were  problems with the proposed method, curing those \nproblems would cause further delay of  this case and the number of depositions a t issue \nwould increase the delays.4  This objection is overruled.   \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nPlaintiff’s Objections are OVERRULED . \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  July 10, 2025  \n \n \n \n \n3 The Magistrate Judge’s Decision brief ly notes this point after rejecting Plaintiff’s proposal \nas an untested method that could result in delays and problems and then finding that \nconducting the depositions as requested by Plaintiff would violate the Protective Order.  (Doc. 172 at 6–8 .)  In this respect, it is not clear that the Magistrate Judge even relies on \nthe number an d necessity for the depositions in denying Plaintiff’s Application.  Even if \nshe does, the Magistrate Judge provides numerous other reasons for denying Plaintiff’s \nApplication.  (Doc. 172 at 1 –7.) \n \n4 However, to the extent Defendants’ assertion that Plaintiff’s Objections should be \noverruled because he has “overlitigat[ed]” this case (Doc. 174 at 3 –4) were intended to \naddress this objection, the Court is not persuaded that bears on this issue.  If Defendants \nhad legitimate challenges to how Plaintiff has pursued discovery in this case, those issues \nshould have been raised with the Magistrate Judge in a timely fashion.  They are not a \nproper basis to overrule Plaintiff’s Objections the Magistrate Judge’s Decision.   \n \nCase 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 178     Filed 07/10/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 10 of 10",

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\nAidong Chen, a former employee of KPMG, appealed the District Court's dismissal of his lawsuit alleging racial and national origin discrimination under Title VII, and misappropriation of intellectual property related to a project involving graphical processing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence (AI). The court found Chen failed to show that his ideas were novel, which is a requirement for intellectual property claims under New Jersey law, and ruled against his related claims of discrimination and bullying.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe main legal issue was whether Chen's claim for misappropriation of his work on the GPU project—which involved AI—constituted novel intellectual property and whether his employment-related claims amounted to a violation under Title VII for discrimination and retaliation.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court upheld the dismissal of Chen’s claims, holding that the GPU project's idea was not novel as it was already in the public domain, and his allegations did not establish a valid misappropriation claim. Additionally, his claims of discrimination and bullying were not sufficiently detailed to sustain a Title VII violation.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine you built a cool robot using building blocks that everyone already knows about and is available to everyone. Later, you claim that someone else stole your robot idea and want credit for it. For your claim to work, your robot would need to have something super unique that only you thought of. The court here said you didn’t make anything new; other people were already using the same blocks the same way. Also, you said you were unfairly treated at work because of your background, but the court said you didn’t have enough details to prove it.",

For the following reasons, we will affirm the \nDistrict Court’s judgment . \nI. \nAs we write primarily for the parties, who are familiar with the facts and \nprocedural history, we will discuss the details only as they are relevant to our analysis.  \nChen worke d at KPMG from 2014 until he was terminated in 2017.  He worked within \nLighthouse Operations Technology, a specialized research and development group.  \nAmong other projects, Chen facilitated and developed an initiative involving the use of \ngraphical proces sing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence.   \nIn 2018, Chen filed an initial lawsuit relating to his experience at KPMG, naming \nKPMG and three individuals as defendants and bringing claims under Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 for race and nati onal origin discrimination and retaliation, see \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e -2(a).  Complaint, Chen v. KPMG, LLP. , 2-18-cv-12650 (D.N.J. Aug. \n10, 2018).1  Chen alleged that a group of his Lighthouse colleagues and supervisors, all \nCaucasian men, systematically under mined and harassed him in order to steal credit for \nhis work and gain control of the GPU project, leading to his termination.  He also alleged \nthat this treatment aligned with a broader pattern of discrimination within Lighthouse \nagainst non -Caucasian empl oyees.  \n \n1 Chen appealed the District Court’s eventual judgment in that matter.  C.A. No. 21 -1014.  Case: 21-1202     Document: 22     Page: 2      Date Filed: 10/04/20213 \n During discovery proceedings, Chen raised a new claim for relief based on alleged \nmisappropriation of intellectual property related to the GPU project.  But Chen did not \nseek to amend his complaint.  \nIn July 2020, while KPMG’s motion for summary judg ment was pending in the \nfirst case, Chen filed his complaint in this second case.  He named KPMG, the three \nindividual defendants from the first suit, and eleven new KPMG employees as \ndefendants.  He primarily claimed that KPMG had used his work on the GPU  project \nwithout appropriately compensating him, presenting this as an intellectual property claim.  \nReferring to Title VII and his earlier complaint, he also called for his former supervisors \nto be disciplined or criminally charged for framing him or gang ing up and bullying him.  \nThe District Court granted KPMG’s motion to dismiss the complaint.2  Chen appeals.  \nII. \nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §  1291.3  We review the District Court’s  \ngrant of a motion to dismiss de novo .  Newark Cab Ass’n. v. Cit y of Newark , 901 F.3d \n \n2 The District Court incorrectly attributed the motion to dismiss to all defendants.  Chen \nattempted to serve the defendants through defense counsel.  Defense counsel indicated, in \nfilings with the District Court, that he represented all defendants but disp uted the \nadequacy of service on behalf of the individual defendants.  Defense counsel filed an \nappearance with the District Court and the motion to dismiss only on behalf of KPMG, \nalthough counsel explicitly made arguments on KPMG’s behalf for dismissal of  the \nclaims against most of the individual defendants, see, e.g. , Br. in Supp. of Mot. to \nDismiss 23 -26, ECF No. 12 -1, and sought dismissal of the entire complaint, see id. at 26.  \nOn appeal, defense counsel appeared and filed a brief on behalf of all defe ndants.  \n3 As the bases of federal question jurisdiction, Chen cited his intellectual property claim, \nhis allegations of bullying, and the Title VII claims brought in his first action.  Compl. 3, \nECF No. 1.  While the District Court construed Chen’s intelle ctual property claim as a Case: 21-1202     Document: 22     Page: 3      Date Filed: 10/04/20214 \n 146, 151 (3d Cir. 2018).   In doing so, we accept all Chen’s factual allegations in his \ncomplaint as true and construe those facts in the light most favorable to  him.  See id.  “To \nsurvive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations, taken \nas true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. ’”  Fleisher v. Standard Ins. , \n679 F.3d 116, 120 (3d Cir. 2012)  (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v.  Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570  \n(2007) ).  “We may affirm a district court for any reason supported by the record.”  \nBrightwell v. Lehman , 637 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir. 2011).  \nIII. \nThe District Court properly dismissed Chen’s intellectual property claim to the \nextent that Chen presented a claim for misappropriation of an idea.  To establish such a \nclaim under New Jersey law, a plaintiff must show that “ (1) the idea was novel; (2) it was \nmade in confidence [to the defendant]; and (3) it was adopted and made use of [ by the \ndefendant in connection with his own activities].”   Baer v. Chase , 392 F.3d 609, 627 (3d \nCir. 2004) (quoting Flemming v. Ronson Corp. , 258 A.2d 153, 156 -57 (N.J. Super. Ct. \nLaw Div. 1969)).  While courts have not clearly articulated a test for novel ty, materials in \nthe public domain, or mere combinations and adaptations of such material, are not novel.  \nId. at 627 -29.   \n \ncommon law claim for misappropriation of an idea, Chen attempted to invoke federal \nintellectual property law and employment law in his indistinct claims.  In these \ncircumstances, the District Court had federal question jurisdictio n under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331 and supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367.  Case: 21-1202     Document: 22     Page: 4      Date Filed: 10/04/20215 \n We agree with the District Court that Chen failed to adequately allege that the \nGPU project involved a novel idea.  It is apparent f rom Chen’s allegations that the \nconcept of using GPUs in advancing artificial intelligence projects was already in the \npublic domain by the start of the project and was actively promoted by a GPU vendor.  \nChen did not allege any novel innovation he introdu ced in the GPU project that rose \nabove combining and adapting existing ideas.  On appeal, he emphasizes that the project \nwas a new and unique initiative within KPMG, but a misappropriation claim requires \nnovelty with respect to the broader market and publi c domain.  See Flemming , 258 A.2d \nat 157 (explaining that an idea may be new to the plaintiff without being novel).4 \nChen’s references to patents are insufficient to establish novelty for the purposes \nof misappropriation or to otherwise state a claim.  As  the District Court noted, Chen did \nnot allege that he is the owner of a valid patent and so cannot state a claim for patent \ninfringement.  See 35 U.S.C. §  271; Hall v. Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. , 705 F.3d 1357, \n1362 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  In his complaint, Chen alleged that KPMG applied for at least one \npatent based on the use of GPUs in artificial intelligence, but he did not identify the \npatent or allege that he was responsible for the specific innovation in any patent.  See \nCompl., ECF No. 1 at 9.5  On appeal , Chen cites one specific KPMG patent, but fails to \n \n4 A misappropriation of ideas claim involves an implied contractual or fiduciary \nrelationship.  Flemming , 258 A.2d at 156.  Chen and KPMG had an actual contractual \nrelationship,  and the parties argued several points regarding the applicable contractual \nprovisions.  As Chen failed to state a misappropriation claim and did not raise a \ncontractual claim, we do not reach these arguments.  \n5 Chen thus did not raise an inventorship clai m under 35 U.S.C. §  256. Case: 21-1202     Document: 22     Page: 5      Date Filed: 10/04/20216 \n explain how the patent specifically reflects his contributions.  In any case, we cannot \nconsider these new allegations.  See In re Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.’s Application for \nAccess to Sealed Transcripts , 913 F.2d 89, 96 (3d Cir. 1990) (“This Court has said on \nnumerous occasions that it cannot consider material on appeal that is outside of the \ndistrict court record.”).   Chen does not provide any alternative legal framework to \nmisappropriation of an idea or patent infringement for interpreting his intellectual \nproperty claims and forfeits any such argument .  See M.S. ex rel. Hall v. Susquehanna \nTwp. Sch. Dist. , 969 F.3d 120, 124  n.3 (3d Cir.  2020) ; N.J. Dep’t of Env’t Prot. v. A m. \nThermoplastics Corp. , 974 F.3d 486, 492 n.2 (3d Cir. 2020) . \nChen’s remaining allegations failed to state any plausible claim to relief.6  He \nidentifies no legal basis other than Title VII for his bullying claim against KPMG and his \n \n6 As the District Court did not resolve the individual defendants’ service objections, the \nDistrict Court’s arguably dismissed the claims against those defendants sua sponte.  In \nnarrow circumstances, courts have upheld a district court’s authority to sua sponte \ndismiss a complaint against a non -moving defendant where it is clear the plaintiff cannot \nsucceed, if the plaintiff has notice and an opportunity to respond to the moving \ndefendant’s relevant arguments.  See Martinez -Rivera v. Sanchez Ramos , 498 F.3d 3, 7 \n(1st Cir. 2007)  (describing limited circumstances in which sua sponte dismissals under \nRule 12(b)(6) are appropriate); Acequia, Inc. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. , 226 F.3d 798, \n807 (7th Cir. 2000) (stating “where one defend ant succeeds in winning summary \njudgment on a ground common to several defendants, the district court may also grant \njudgment to the non -moving defendants, if the plaintiff had an adequate opportunity to \nargue in opposition”); see also  Wachtler v. Cnty. of  Herkimer , 35 F.3d 77, 82 (2d \nCir.1994); Bonny v. Soc’y of Lloyd’s , 3 F.3d 156, 162 (7th Cir. 1993); cf. Oatess v. \nSobolevitch , 914 F.2d 428, 430 n.5 (3d Cir. 1990) (noting, in a different context, that a \ndistrict court may sua sponte raise the deficiency of a complaint so long as the plaintiff is \ngiven an opportunity to respond).  Here, the non -moving defendants were represented  by \nthe same counsel as the moving defendant and are participating in this appeal.  Chen had \nnotice and an opportunity to respond to the motion to dismiss.  We will affirm the District Case: 21-1202     Document: 22     Page: 6      Date Filed: 10/04/20217 \n three supervisors but develops no allegations of racial or national origin discrimination in \nhis complaint in this case.  He also seeks inappropriate relief.  F or instance, Chen seeks \ncriminal charges against some of the defendants, but civil plaintiffs cannot obtain such \nrelief.  See Linda R.S. v. Richard D. , 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973) (“[A] private citizen lacks \na judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution  or nonprosecution of another.”) .  To the \nextent that Chen wished to import the Title VII claims from his first lawsuit into his new \ncomplaint, he was not permitted to do so.  Cf. Walton v. Eaton Corp. , 563 F.2d 66, 70 (3d \nCir. 1977) (en banc)  (“[I]t is cl ear that [the plaintiff] had no right to maintain two \nseparate actions involving the same subject matter at the same time in the same court and \nagainst the same defendant. ”). \nMany of Chen’s arguments on appeal are procedural complaints about both of his \nlawsuits.  These arguments are unavailing.  Chen’s baselessly alleged judicial bias based \non unfavorable rulings.  Cf. Arrowpoint Cap. Corp. v. Arrowpoint Asset Mgmt., LLC , \n793 F.3d 313, 330 (3d Cir. 2015) (“[A]dverse rulings —even if they are erroneous —are \nnot in themselves proof of prejudice or bias.”).  Chen also complains that the case did not \nproceed to discovery and a jury trial.  But Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) \n“authorizes a court to dismiss a claim on the basis of a dispositive of law” in order to \n“streamline [] litigation by dispensing with needless discovery and factfinding .”  Neitzke \n \nCourt’s dismissal of the individual defendants under the particular cir cumstances of this \ncase.

We have considered his remaining arguments, \nbut they are either immaterial or unsupported by the record.  \nIV. \nAccor dingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.7  \n \n7 We deny the requests for reassignment of the case and direct relief against the \ndefendants that Chen made in his brief, as well as the motion for a conference included in \nhis reply brief.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Robert J. Morgan filed a 45-page document with the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, seemingly intending to initiate a lawsuit against Sprouts Farmers Market. His initial submissions were found insufficient as a complaint since they lacked factual allegations to support any claims. Of note, Morgan included a lengthy document generated by ChatGPT, which the court criticized for its inaccuracy and irrelevance to potential legal claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Morgan's filings sufficiently state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed Morgan's complaint with leave to amend, allowing him 30 days to file a more concise and factual amended complaint that personally explains his reasons for suing Sprouts, without the use of AI-generated content.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: Think of it like turning in a school report. Robert handed in a super long, messy paper that didn't clearly explain why he was upset with a grocery store. The judge said, \"This isn't clear enough for me to help you. Plus, don't use a robot to write your paper because it didn't do a good job!\" Robert has been given extra time to write a clearer summary in his own words.",

No. CV-25-08217 -PCT-KML  \n \nORDER  \n \n  \n Plaintiff Robert J. Morgan mailed numerous documents to the court , including 45 \npages that were docketed as a complaint , an application to proceed in forma pauperis, and \na motion to allow electronic filing. (Doc s. 1, 2, 3 .) Morgan ’s application to proceed in \nforma pauperis  is granted but to the extent Morgan’s 45 -page document w as intended as a \ncomplaint, it is dismissed  with leave to amend . 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2).  \n The first page of what was docketed as a complaint is captioned “In the Flagstaff \nCivil Justice Court, County of Coconino, State of Arizona.” (Doc. 1 at 1.) That page  \nreferences Morgan’s “ongoing civil case against Sprouts Farmers Market” and requests all \ndocuments “be attached to the existing case file .” (Doc. 1 at 1.) Morgan has no other \npending case in this court. Refer ring to a different court in the caption and referencing a \n“pending case” that does not exist in this court indicates Morgan may not hav e intended to \ninitiate suit in this court. But assuming Morgan intended to do so, his submissions do not \nqualify as a complaint sufficient for the case to proceed.  \n The first page of the 45 -page filing identifies the “Legal Authority and Supporting Case 3:25-cv-08217-KML     Document 6     Filed 10/20/25     Page 1 of 3 \n- 2 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n Statutes” Morgan believes are relevant. (Doc. 1 at 1.) But that page does not include any \nfactual allegations explaining wh y those statute s might apply. Other portions of the 45 -\npage filing do not provide additional guidance.  The filing includes Morgan’s arguments \nagainst the enforceability of an arbitration agreement (Doc. 1 at 7 -9), information regarding \npay Morgan  received from Sprouts (Doc. 1 at 16 -18), and a lengthy document apparently \nproduced by ChatGPT (Doc. 1 at 21 -34).  \n  Self-represented pleadings are liberally construed, Haines v. Kerner , 404 U.S. 519, \n520-21 (1972), but conclusory and vague allegations are not enough to state a claim for \nrelief. Ivey v. Bd. of Regents , 673 F.2d 266, 268 (9th Cir. 1982).  And when liberally \nconstruing a pleading, the court “may not supply essential elements of the claim that were \nnot initially pled.” Id. Here, Morgan has provided  no factual allegations explain ing why he \nis suing Sprouts.  With out facts explaining what happened, Morgan cann ot pursue this \nlawsuit.  \nMorgan is given 30 days to file a first amended complaint. If Morgan elects to file \nan amended complaint, he must write short, plain statements explaining what happened \nand why he is suing Sprouts. The court maintains a webpage for self -represented litigants  \nat https://www.azd.uscourts.gov/proceeding -without -attorney -0. That page includes links \nto “Forms for Self -Represented Litigants.” One of the forms is for employment \ndiscrimination. If Morgan is attempting to sue Sprouts for employment discrimination, he \nshould use the form available at \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/complaint_for_employment_disc rimination.p\ndf. If Morgan is attempting to sue Sprouts for something other than employment \ndiscrimination, he should use the form most appropriate to his situation.  \nFinally, Morgan is cautioned against us ing artificial intelligence to prepare his \nfilings. The lengthy document generated by ChatGPT that Morgan submitted appears to \nprovide legal analysis of possible claims.  But upon a cursory review of that document, it is \nnot remotely accurate and it proposes many claims and theories that do not apply. In \npreparing his amended complaint , Morgan shall not use ChatGPT or any other similar form Case 3:25-cv-08217-KML     Document 6     Filed 10/20/25     Page 2 of 3 \n- 3 -  \n \n \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nof artificial intelligence .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Lillie M. Middlebrooks filed a pro se complaint alleging that her property was transferred without due process via a deficient quitclaim deed. The court grew suspicious that her filings, which were unusually well-formatted for a non-attorney, might have been ghostwritten, possibly violating legal practice regulations. The court suggested she might have used AI, like ChatGPT, in preparing her documents, but ultimately extended her deadline to clarify whether she received assistance in drafting her pleadings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff improperly received assistance from an attorney or another person, potentially violating Georgia's laws on unauthorized practice of law, and whether artificial intelligence like ChatGPT was used to draft legal documents.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court has not yet reached a final decision on the main case but has extended the deadline for Plaintiff to clarify who, if anyone, assisted in drafting her documents, failing which her case may be dismissed for not complying with court directives.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: A woman named Lillie M. Middlebrooks is trying to sue because she claims her property was taken wrongly. When the court saw her paperwork, they thought it was too neat and professional to be done by someone without a lawyer's help. The court asked her if a lawyer or someone else helped her, including possibilities like using a computer program (AI). If she doesn't explain who helped, the court might toss out her case. They extended the deadline to give her more time to answer.",

MIDDLEBROOKS ,  \n               Plaintiff , \nv. \nCITY OF MACON -BIBB COUNTY , \nGEORGIA , et al. ,  \n             Defendant s. \n \n CIVIL  ACTION NO.  \n 5:23-cv-00083 -TES  \n \nORDER  \n \n \nOn March 2, 2023, Plaintiff  Lillie M. Middlebrooks  filed a pro se  complaint \nagainst 10 Defendants alleging that they “transferred” her house, land, and property \nwithout due process of law  by recording an allegedly statutorily deficient quitclaim \ndeed . [Doc. 1, p. 2]. Following discovery, Plaintiff began filing motions for summary \njudgment against each Defendant sued in his or her individual capacity. See [Doc. 19]; \n[Doc. 20]; [Doc. 21]; [Doc. 28]; [Doc. 30]; [Doc. 32]; [Doc. 34]. Because Plaintiff’s filings \nused proper legal citations, headings, and arguments, but were purportedly drafted by \na pro se plaintiff who does not herself appear to be an attorney , the Court grew \nconcerned that an unknown attorney may be ghost -writing for Plaintiff, in which case \nthat attorney may be violating the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct. See [Doc. 33, \np. 2 n. 1]. Alternatively, if someone not licensed to practice law  drafted those documents  Case 5:23-cv-00083-TES     Document 40     Filed 11/30/23     Page 1 of 42 for her , that person could be guilty of the unauthorized practice of law . O.C.G.A.  § 15-\n19-51 (“It shall be unlawful for any person other than a duly licensed attorney at law  . . .  \n[t]o practice or appear as an attorney at law for any person other than himself in any \ncourt of this state or before any judicial body .”). To resolve any confusion or \nmisunderstanding, the Court issued a Show Cause Order , asking Plaintiff to explain \nwho—if anyone —drafted her filings for her, with a deadline of November 27, 2023.  \n[Doc. 33].  \nWithin a day of receiving the Court’s Show Cause Order, Plaintiff telephoned \nChambers, informing the Courtroom Deputy that she would not be responding to the \nShow Cause Order  and accusing the Court of being racist for issuing such an order to a \nblack litigant.1 Rather than answer ing the simple question in the Court’s Show Cause \nOrder, Plaintiff instead filed a Motion to Disqualify, formally accusing the undersigned \nof being “racist,” “a bigot” and one who subscribes to “Jim Crow ’s ideology.” [Doc. 39, \npp. 6–7].2 \nThe Court wishes to clarify its reasons for issuing the Show Cause Order. First, \nthe Order resulted from the Court’s concern about non -attorneys representing litigants \nor licensed attorneys ghost -writing pleadings for litigants to sign and present as their \n \n1 Nothing in the pleadings highlights or even suggests that Plaintiff is black , and the Court certainly had \nno idea of her race before Plaintiff’s phone call.  \n \n2 The Court will allow Plaintiff to personally argue her Motion to Disqualify on December 2 0, 2023,  when \nit has scheduled oral argument for the other pending motions in this case. See [Doc. 29].  Case 5:23-cv-00083-TES     Document 40     Filed 11/30/23     Page 2 of 43 own. See [Doc. 33, p. 2 n. 1]. Here, Plaintiff presented a complaint and motions that were \nstructured, stylized, and cited in the fashion of most attorney -drafted complaints —a \nrarity in the Court’s experience with lay litigants. See, e.g. , [Doc. 1]; [Doc. 19]. The Court \nrightfully inquired —as it has  done  in other cases —as to whether Plaintiff solely drafted \nher pleadings. See [Doc. 33, p. 2 (“ The Court is concerned because usually,  pro se filings \nare handwritten and are not correctly stylized with formatting customarily used by \nlicensed attorneys. Plaintiff Middlebrook’s filings, however, are typed and contain \nproper legal citations, headings, and arguments .”)].  \nBefore issuing the Order, the Court searched for Plaintiff in Georgia Bar Member \nRecords to see if she herself is a Georgia -licensed attorney , but the Court found no such \ndocumentation . See [Doc. 33, p. 2]; Member Records, State Bar of Georgia (2023), \nhttps://www.gabar.org/membership/membersearch.cfm  (last visited Nov. 13, 2023). \nHowever, t he Court also knew that it is a possibility that Plaintiff is an attorney in \nanother state or perhaps attended a year or two of law school —in which case the Show \nCause Or der provided her an opportunity to respond and explain so. Or, perhaps \nPlaintiff simply drafted a well -organized complaint on her own . (If the latter is true, \nthen the Court would have gladly compliment ed her on her effort  and natural skill .) \nMaybe she  even  used ChatGPT or another artificial intelligence software. All of these \nexplanations are perfectly rational and  lawful , and if any happen to be the truth , all \nPlaintiff needed to do was say so. Instead, however,  Plaintiff not only failed to respond Case 5:23-cv-00083-TES     Document 40     Filed 11/30/23     Page 3 of 44 by the Court’s deadline , but she also  assumed the worst of the Court in her phone call \nand subsequent Motion to Disqualify.  See [Doc. 39].  \nAlthough the Court warned Plaintiff  that failure to respond  to the Show Cause \nOrder  could lead to the Court ’s dismiss al of  her action for failure to prosecute  under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) , the Court exercises its discretion and  instead \nEXTENDS  her time to respond, giving her another opportunity to clarify for the Court \nwhether an attorney  or any other person assisted her in drafting her pleadings or if she \nused artificial intelligence programs such as ChatGPT for assistance. See [Doc. 33, p. 2]. \nAgain, the Court’s primary interest lies in determining if others broke the law or if \nattorneys committed ethical violations, not Plaintiff. Should Plaintiff again refuse to \nanswer, she runs the very real risk that the Court will dismiss her complaint for failing \nto follow the Court’s lawful order.  \nAlthough Plaintiff failed to meet the Court’s deadline of November 27, 2023, to \nrespond to its Show Cause Order [Doc. 33], the Court now EXTENDS by 14 days \nPlaintiff’s time to respond, ordering Plaintiff to RESPOND  by December 14, 2023 . \nSO ORDERED , this  30th  day of  November , 202 3. \n       \nS/ Tilman E.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Monica Raeven Linker, under supervised release for a previous offense of receipt of child pornography, allegedly violated the conditions of her supervision by using an AI painting application to create pornographic images, some of which may depict minors. The violation involves using the app to generate explicit images based on inappropriate search criteria, prompting her probation officer to request a warrant from the court for further proceedings.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Monica Raeven Linker violated the conditions of her supervised release by engaging with AI-generated pornographic content that potentially depicts minors, contrary to her prohibition from viewing or possessing such material.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The document is a petition requesting the court to issue a warrant for Monica Raeven Linker to appear and address the allegations of violating her supervised release conditions. The actual court ruling or decision on this petition is not included in the document.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Monica Raeven Linker, who previously got in trouble for having illegal pictures, isn't supposed to look at any more bad pictures. She used an app on her phone that makes pictures using AI, and it made pictures that might not be allowed since they look like young people in bad situations. Because of this, the officer who checks on her wants the court to call her in to talk about her using those pictures.",

According to monitoring\nreports, the client used an application titled ArtSense, an android only application, which is\ndescribed as the “ultimate AI painting app.” The app further describes its ability to utilize\nartificial intelligence to “transform” thoughts into paintings.

It is also\nnoted that Ms. Linker often used search terms to include “small”, “small girls” and “small\nbreasts,” seemingly search criteria that is likely to result in very young participants being\nshown and in which it seems that the terms could also likely describe minors or children.\nOn January 17, 2024, Ms. Linker reported to the U.S. Probation Office as directed and did\nsurrender her phone. When confronted as to the concerns as identified herein, Ms. Linker\nresponded that she had downloaded the application in question to recreate an image of\nherself and her fiancee, but after entering innocuous search criteria, she stated that she was\npresented with a pornographic image. When confronted about her ongoing inappropriate\nsearch criteria, Ms. Linker stated that she had “blacked out” and didn’t remember searching\nfor any other inappropriate images. Ms. Linker also indicated that she stayed up crying due\nto having viewed the pornographic images, and the thought of her fiancee, who she is not\nable to have contacted with. Ms. Linker stated that she did not report the incident to this\nofficer last night as it was late, and she stated that she forgot to do so this morning. Ms.\nLinker stated that she deleted the application, as it was the only way to remove the\npornographic image from her phone. \nGiven the client’s conduct as outlined, it is the belief of the undersigned officer that a\nwarrant is appropriate. \nThe U.S. Probation Office respectfully recommends the Court issue a WARRANT  requiring the offender to appear\nto answer to the allegation(s) contained in this petition.\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.\nExecuted on: January 17, 2024\ns/Chris Heinen\nChris Heinen\nU.S. Probation OfficerCase 4:19-cr-06002-SAB    ECF No. 170    filed 01/17/24    PageID.<pageID>   Page 2 of 3Case 4:19-cr-06002-SAB    ECF No. 170    filed 01/17/24    PageID.<pageID>   Page 3 of 3",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Heidi Saas v. Major, Lindsey & Africa, LLC, the court reviewed a motion by the defendants to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's complaint. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants engaged in discriminatory practices by employing algorithmic tools that exhibited bias against women with employment gaps. The court dismissed the complaint, concluding that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient factual support for her claims, including those of algorithmic discrimination and fraudulent inducement.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff sufficiently alleged claims of discrimination due to algorithmic bias, retaliation under Title VII and the ADEA, and fraudulent inducement against the defendants.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint, holding that she did not provide adequate factual allegations to make her claims plausible, particularly regarding the existence and discriminatory impact of algorithmic tools, retaliatory conduct by the defendants, and fraudulent inducement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of this case like someone complaining they didn't get a job because a robot didn't like their resume. The person believed the robot was biased against people who took a break from work to raise kids. The court said, \"You haven't shown us enough that this robot even exists or that it was unfair,\" so they couldn't move forward with her case.",

Civil No.: 1:23- cv-02102- JRR  \n MAJOR, LINDSEY & AFRICA, LLC,  \net al. ,  \n    \nDefendants . \n    \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n Pending before the court is Defendants’ Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Complaint, or, in the \nAlternative, Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 6; the “Motion”).  The court has reviewed all papers , \nand no hearing is necessary.  Local Rule 105.6 (D. Md. 2023).  For the reasons that follow, by \naccompanying order, the Motion (ECF No. 6), construed as a motion to dismiss , will be granted.   \nI. BACKGROUND \n This action arises from Plaintiff’s contacts with a recruiter from Major, Lindsey & Africa, \nLLC ( “MLA ”).1  (ECF No. 1; the “Complaint.” )  In May of 2021, Plaintiff received a message \nfrom Riley  Catone , a recruiter with MLA, o n LinkedIn, requesting an interview.  (ECF No. 1-1 ¶ \n5.)  Thereafter ,2 Ms. Catone had a phone interview with Plaintiff in which she told Plaintiff  that \nMLA’s “system did not work,” that “women with gaps in their resumes were ‘getting left behind’ in the job market,” and that she had “difficulty ‘getting businesses past the m otherhood gap’ when \nreviewing candidates.”  Id. ¶ 6.  Ms. Catone told Plaintiff that she was a “rockstar” and “wanted \n \n1 For purposes of resolving the Motion, the court accepts as true all well -pled facts set forth in the Complaint.  (ECF \nNo. 3.)  Nemet  Chevrolet, Ltd. v. Consumeraffairs.com,  Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 255 (4th Cir. 2009).  \n2 Plaintiff states that this interview occurre d on May 12, 2021, but that date does not appear to be correct based on the \nother allegations of the Complaint and the attached exhibits.  (ECF No. 1- 1 at p. 3, 16, 19.)   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 1 of 142 \n to sell [her] services to business es.”  Id.  Following that call, Plaintiff emailed her resume to Ms. \nCatone for a job posting at Uber.  I d. ¶ 7.  Ms. Catone shared the Uber job posting with Plaintiff.  \nId.  Plaintiff  then messaged  the Chief Privacy Officer at Uber  via LinkedIn  to let her know that  her \nresume would be submitted f or the position, and the Chief Privacy Officer responded that h er team \ndid not have any openings at that time.3  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 8.)  Days later, Ms. Catone contacted \nPlaintiff about another position with Zendesk.  Id. at p. 19.  Plaintiff again provided her resume \nfor the position with Zendesk.  Id. ¶ 10.  Plaintiff then messaged the Chief Privacy Officer at \nZendesk via LinkedIn to inform her that her resume had been submitted, but the Chief Privacy \nOfficer r esponded that the position had been filled.  Id. ¶ 10.  Thereafter, Plaintiff asked  Ms. Catone \nfor an update on her applications and states Ms. Catone “did not confirm whether or not she sent \n[her] resume to either Uber or Zendesk.”  Id. ¶ 11.  On September 21, 2021, Ms. Catone emailed \nPlaintiff about a part -time position, which Plaintiff declined. Id. ¶ 12.  On May 4, 2022, another \nMLA employee emailed Plaintiff about another job, and  Plaintiff did not respond.  (ECF No. 1- 1 \n¶ 15.)  \n Plaintiff file d a charge of discrimination against MLA with the U.S. Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission (“EEOC”)  on May 31, 2022, alleging that she  “think[s]” MLA “[is] \nusing s creening tools . . . to screen- out applicants ,” and that MLA “did not refer [her] for future \njobs and later disappeared.”   Id. at p. 21–22.  On May 8, 2023, EEOC issued a Right to Sue letter \nto Plaintiff .  Id. at p. 23.  Plaintiff filed the Complaint in this court on August 4, 2023 against MLA \nand Allegis Group, Inc. (“Allegis”).  (ECF No. 1.)  Plaintiff contends that  Allegis “owns MLA.”  \nId. ¶ 3.  Though at times inconsistent, Plaintiff asserts the follo wing claims : failure to refer  and \n \n3 The manner in which Plaintiff pleads  these allegations in her Complaint suggests  she found out that there was no \nopen position with Uber before  she sent her resume to Ms. Catone.  (ECF No. 1 -1 ¶¶ 6 –8.)  Because such a reading is \ninconsistent with her claims  and would certainly invalidate the claims  to that allegation , the court assumes  that dates \nidentified in the Complaint are typographical errors.  Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 2 of 143 \n “algorithmic bias” in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) and the \nAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (“ADEA”); retaliation in violation of Title VII and the ADEA; and fraudulent i nducement in violation of Maryland law .  (ECF No. 1.)   \nPlaintiff alleges in her Complaint that Defendants use “algorithmic, machine learning, and \nother technical tools in the conduct of their business, and their use of such tools caused [her] to be unlawf ully discriminated against on the basis ” of her sex and age.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 19.)  Plaintiff \nadmits, however, Defendants asserted that they do not use artificial intelligence and that discovery is needed to ascertain the nature of the tools.\n4  Id.   She alleges that Defendants ’ artificial \nintelligence, “job progression” “tools” result in “automated discrimination ” and “result in negative \nresults and disparate impacts” against people who, like Plaintiff , have a “motherhood gap”  in their \nemployment.5  Id. ¶ 22.  As a result, Plaintiff believes that Defendants  unlawfully classified her in \na way that prevented her resume from being referred to businesses for employment.  Id. ¶ 23.  \nPlaintiff simultaneously argues that there were no available positions, an d that Defendants instead \nwanted her resume so they could be  “paid for [her] data .”  Id. ¶ 30.   \nPlaintiff also states that one of the Defendant s (but does not identify which one)  retaliated \nagainst her by “creating and furnishing . . . defamatory data” about her to others “in an effort to \ndisqualify [her] from being referred to employers because [she] filed” a charge of discrimination with EEOC.  (ECF No. 1- 1 at p. 1, ¶ 29.)   However, she admits  that discovery is needed to \ndetermine whether they actually did as alleged.  Id. ¶ 29.   \nFinally, Plaintiff alleges that one of the Defendant s, presumably MLA, knowingly induced \n \n4 Plaintiff’s response in opposition to the Motion further clarifies that her allegation is based on the assumption that \nbecause “Allegis made 14.8 Billion in 2022, brokering globally in rec ruitment and employment data,” that Defendants \ncannot process “all of [that] data” without artificial intelligence.  (ECF No. 10 at p. 7.)   \n5 Although Plaintiff does not define the phrase “motherhood gap,” it is apparent from context that it refers to the  period \nof time in her thirties when she was  raising her  children and  not actively  participating  in the workforce.  (ECF No. 1 -\n1 at p. 3 n.4.)   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 3 of 144 \n her to email her personal data ( her resume ) to it “by making false representations and promising \nlucrative positions that did not exist. ”  Id. ¶ 30.  MLA  did so to “monetize [her] data,” with “no \nintention of getting [her] a job, or [with] a reckless disregard for their obligation to try and present \n[her] resume for consideration of employment.”   Id.    \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f)  \nFederal pleading requirements require that a claim for relief contain “a short and plain \nstatement of the claim showing the pleader is entitled to relief.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 8(a)(2).  \nAccordingly, under Rule 12(f), the court may, on its own or on motion by a party, “strike from a \npleading . . . any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter ” where it is insufficient.   \nFED. R. CIV. P. 12(f).  “ In determining whether to grant a motion  to strike , the court ‘enjoys wide \ndiscretion  . . . in order to minimize delay, prejudice and confusion by narrowing the issues for \ndiscovery and trial.’”  Baltimore  v. Baltimore  City L. Dep’t, No. CV ELH -22-1901, 2022 WL \n17812642, at *2 (D. Md. Dec. 16, 2022)  (quoting Haley Paint Co. v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & \nCo., 279 F.R.D. 331, 336 (D. Md. 2012) ).  “Rule 12(f) motions are generally viewed with disfavor \nbecause striking a portion of a pleading is a drastic remedy and because it is often sought by the movant simply as a dilatory tactic .”  Waste  Mgmt.  Holdings, Inc. v. Gilmore , 252 F.3d 316, 347 \n(4th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).  Accordingly, on a Rule 12(f) motion, the court “must view the pleading under attack in a light most favorable to the pleader.”   Haley Paint  Co., 279 F.R.D. at  \n336.  \nB. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \nA motion asserted under Rule 12(b)(6) “test[s] the sufficiency of a complaint;” it does not \n“resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.”  Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 4 of 145 \n Presley v. City of Charlottesville , 464 F.3d 480, 483 (4th Cir. 2006) (quoting Edwards v. City of \nGoldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 243 (4th Cir. 1999)).  Accordingly, a “Rule 12(b)(6) motion should only \nbe granted if, after accepting all well -pleaded allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint as true and \ndrawing all reasonable f actual inferences from those facts in the plaintiff’s favor, it appears certain \nthat the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.” Edwards , 178 F.3d at 244.   \n“While legal conclusions can provide the framework of a complaint, they must be \nsupported by factual allegations.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 679 (2009).  “Factual \nallegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (citations and footnote omitted).  “[A] complaint that provides \nno more than ‘labels and conclusions,’ or ‘a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,’ is insufficient.”  Bourgeois v. Live Nation Ent., Inc., 3 F. Supp. 3d 423, 434 (D. Md. 2014) \n(quoting Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555).  “The [c]ourt must be able to deduce ‘more than the mere \npossibility of misconduct’; the facts of the complaint, accepted as true, must demonstrate that the \nplaintiff is entitled to relief.”  Evans  v. 7520 Surratts  Rd. Operations, LLC, No. 8:21- CV-01637-\nPX, 2021 WL 5326463, at *2 (D. Md. Nov. 16, 2021) (quoting Ruff in v. Lockheed Martin Corp., \n126 F. Supp. 3d 521, 526 (D. Md. 2015)).  \nRelevant here, “ pro se  pleadings are liberally construed and held to a less stringent standard \nthan pleadings drafted by lawyers.”  Gray v. Wash. Metro Area Transit Auth., No. DKC -16-1792, \n2017 WL 511910, at *2 (D. Md. Feb. 8, 2017) (citing Erickson v. Paradus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007)).  \n“Liberal construction means that the court will read the pleadings to state a valid claim to the extent Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 5 of 146 \n that it is possible to do so from the facts availa ble; it does not mean that the court should rewrite \nthe complaint to include claims never presented.”  Id.  (citations omitted).  \nIII. ANALYSIS  \nDefendants first ask this court to strike the complaint, as it constitutes a “shotgun pleading” \nthat fails to apprise Defendant s of the claims against them and the grounds in support  of the specific \nclaims.6  (ECF No. 6 -1 at p. 8–9.)  Alternatively, Defendants argue that Plaintiff’s Complaint \nshould be dismissed because it fails to state plausible claims under Title VII , the ADEA, and \nMaryland law .7  Id. at p. 10 –18.  Plaintiff opposes the Motion.  (ECF No. 10.)   \nA. Motion to Strike Plai ntiff’s Complaint  \nDefendants argue the Complaint as a whole should be struck as a “shotgun pleading.”   (ECF \nNo. 6- 1 at p. 7.)  “A ‘ shotgun pleading’ is one that ‘fails to articulate claims with sufficient clarity \nto allow the defendant to frame a responsive pleading . . . or [one in which] it is virtually impossible \nto know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claims for relief[.]”  Baxter  v. \nAmeriHome  Mortg. Co., LLC, 617 F. Supp. 3d 346, 351 (D. Md. 2022) (quoting Lee v. Meyers , \nNo. ELH -21-1589, 2022 WL 252960, at *11 (D. Md. Jan. 27, 2022)).  See Lampkin- Asam  v. \nVolusia Cnty.  Sch. Bd., 261 F. App’ x 274, 277 (11th Cir. 2008) (“A complaint that fails to articulate \nclaims with sufficient clarity to allow the defendant to frame a res ponsive pleading constitutes a \n‘shotgun pleading.’”).  However, here, Plaintiff has articulated at least some claims with sufficient \nclarity.  For example , Plaintiff sets forth her allegations with respect to her fraudulent inducement  \nclaim in Paragraphs 30 through 32.   As a result, Defendants ’ argument to strike  the whole \n \n6 Defendants also argue that Plaintiff’s pleadings should not be afforded the “special judicial solitude” afforded to pro \nse parties  because she is a lawyer.  (ECF No. 6 -1 at p. 6.)  However, w hile Plaintiff is an attorney, she is not barred in \nthis court, nor has  she claimed any litigation practice or experience.  Despite being a lawyer, Plaintiff is still a pro se  \nlitigant whose pleadings are subject to liberal construction.  See Erickson , 551 U.S. at 94, supra .    \n7 Defendants  also argue that all claims against Allegis should be dismissed because Allegis does n ot own MLA \ncontrary to Plaintiff’s allegations.  (ECF No. 6 -1 at p. 9– 10.)  At this stage, the court accept s the allegations of the \nComplaint as true.  The court is  thus not persuaded that Allegis should be dismissed solely based on a factual dispute.   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 6 of 147 \n Complaint is unwarranted.  The court will therefore decline to exercise its discretion to strike the \nComplaint and will instead view the Motion as one seeking to dismiss Plaintiff’s Comp laint \npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).  To the extent there are remaining allegations and claims that may constitute impermissible “ shotgun pleading,” the court will address them in the context of the \nmotion to dismiss.  See McCrea  v. Wells  Fargo, No. CV RDB -18-2490, 2019 WL 2513770, at *7 \n(D. Md. June 17, 2019), aff’d, 852 F. App’ x 112 (4th Cir. 2021)  (discussing dismissal for \nimpermissible “shotgun pleading” under Rule 12(b)(6)).  \nB. Title VII and the ADEA Claims  \nBoth Title VII and the ADEA prohibit employment agencies —meaning, \n“any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure  employees for  an \nemployer or to procure for  employees  opportunities to work for an employer”—from unlawfully \ndiscriminating against applicants.8  42 U.S.C. § 2000e(c).  See 29 U.S.C. § 630(c) (“ The term \n‘employment agency ’ means any  person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to \nprocure employees  for an  employer.”) .  Specifically, it is unlawful for an em ployment agency “to \nfail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate against, any individual because \nof,” relevant her e, her sex or age.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(b) ; 29 U.S.C. § 623(b).   \n“[T]here are few cases dealing with discrimination by employment agencies ,” specifically  \nwith respect  to discrimination  in failure  to refer  for employment.

Similarly, both \nTitle VII and the ADEA also make it unlawful for an employment agency to discriminate against \nany individual because she has, relevant here, “ made a charge, tes tified, assisted, or participated \nin any manner in an investigation [or] proceeding” under the statute .  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -3(a); 29 \nU.S.C. § 623(d).  See Scaglione v. Chappaqua Cent.  Sch. Dist. , 209 F. Supp. 2d 311, 315 (S.D.N.Y. \n2002) (“Like employers, employment agencies  may not retaliate against those opposing illegal \npractices.”).  \n1. Failure to Refer  Claim / Algorithmic Bias Claim  \nAs state supra, employment agencies may not “fail or refuse to refer for employment” and \nindividual because of h er sex or age.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e -2(b); 29 U.S.C. § 623(b).  To demonstrate \nsuch a claim, a plaintiff “must allege that the employment agency  refused or failed to refer the \n[her]  to an available position with an employer on the basis of a discriminatory animus regarding \nthe protected factor .”  Syed , 2015 WL 1622094, at *6 n.9.  See Kelly  Servs.,  Inc., 598 F.3d at  1030 \n(“The plain language of § 2000e –2(b) states that an employment agency violates Title VII if it \n“fail[s] or refuse[s] to refer for employment .  . . any individual because of his  . . . [protected \nstatus].” ).    \nTo the extent Plaintiff’s claim is based on disparate treatment, she has failed to state a \nclaim.  First, Plaintiff  does not allege that Defendants refused, or failed, to refer her for an available \nposition based on her protected status.  S he instead contends that  they did so because they wanted \nto profit from the sale of her data.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 30.)  Moreover, Plaintiff  alleges that no available Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 8 of 149 \n positions actually existed and instead were merely a ruse to access and misuse her personal \ninformation.  Id.  \nPlaintiff’s allegation of “algorithmic bias”  is similarly insufficient.  Plaintiff alleges that \nDefendants use “job progression” “tools” that “generally disqualif[y] and exclude [] anyone with a \ngap in their resume,” hav ing a disparate impact on women with a “motherhood gap,” like Plaintiff.  \n(ECF No. 1-1 ¶ 22.)  Under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(k), Title VII provides:  \nAn unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is \nestablished under this subchapter only if- \n \n(i) a  complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a \nparticular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and the \nrespondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is jo b \nrelated for the position in question and consistent with business \nnecessity  . . . \n \n42 U.S.C. § 2000e -2( k)(1)(A)(i).  See Smith  v. City of Jackson,  Miss. , 544 U.S. 228, 232 (2005)  \n(holding “that the ADEA does authorize recovery in ‘ disparate- impact’ cases”).   “Thus, a plaintiff \nestablishes a prima facie disparate- impact  claim  by showing that the employer ‘ uses a particular \nemployment practice that causes a disparate impact’ on one of the prohibited bases.”  Lewis  v. City \nof Chicago, Ill. , 560 U.S. 205, 212 (2010) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)).   \nPlaintiff’s claim fails here because it is entirely speculative.  Plaintiff has not identified a \nparticular employment practice  that exists.  Her a llegation  is based solely on supposition that \nDefendants use artificial intelligence tools because they are large businesses.  (ECF No. 10 at p. \n7.)  Plaintiff’s allegation , however, that MLA stated that it did not use artificial intelligence tools, \ndirect ly contradicts her supposition.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶¶ 19, 22, 28.)  Ms. Catone ’s comment that she \nhad trouble “getting businesses past the ‘ motherhood gap’ ” does not change the court’s analysis ,  \nas Plaintiff still doe s not allege a particular employment practice.  Ms. Catone’s  comment, while Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 9 of 1410 \n perhaps raising suspicion, does not relate to MLA’s artificial intelligence system.  Id. ¶ 6.  Finally, \nas a separate matter, Plaintiff makes no meaningful allegation that the so -called “tools” have a \ndispa rate impact on applicants based on age.  See ECF No. 1- 1 at ¶ 22.  She instead conclusorily \nalleges that Defendants “violated” the ADEA with their purported use of the artificial intelligence.  \nId.  E ven considered in the light most favorable to Plaintiff , Plaintiff’s allegations are  simply \ninsufficient to state a plausible claim for relief for failure to refer in violation of Title VII and the \nADEA.  \n2. Retaliation  \n As explained supra, plaintiff s may prove that the employment agency “retaliated against \nthem for engaging in protected activity through one of two ways: (1) by direct evidence of \nretaliatory animus; or (2) through the McDonnell  Douglas Corp. v. Green , 411 U.S. 792 (1973), \nburden- shifting framework.”   Walton v. Harker , 33 F.4th 165, 171 (4th Cir. 2022)  (citing Foster  \nv. Univ.  of Md.-E. Shore , 787 F.3d 243, 249 (4th Cir. 2015)).  As is the case here, where there is \nno direct evidence of a retaliatory animus , a plaintiff must first set forth the elements of a prima \nfacie case of retaliation  under Title VII and the ADEA, meaning: “ (1) she engaged in a protected \nactivity, (2) the employer acted adversely against her, and (3) there was a causal connection \nbetween the protected activity and the asserted adverse action.”   Walto n, 33 F.4th at  177 (quoting \nHoyle v.  Freightliner,  LLC , 650 F.3d 321, 337 (4th  Cir. 2011) ).   \n Wh ile f iling a charge of discrimination with the  EEOC is certainly protected activity, \nPlaintiff otherwise fails to state a claim of retaliation under the law.9  See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e -3(a); \n29 U.S.C. § 623(d), supra.  The alleged adverse action on which Plaintiff rests is that Defendants \n \n9 Plaintiff’s Complaint is inconsistent with respect to whether she intended to assert a retaliation claim.  See ECF No. \n1 at p. 5; ECF No. 1 -1 at p. 1, ¶ 29 (stating in one part that she is not complaining of retaliation and stating in another \nthat she was subject to retaliation in the form of “creating and furnishing . . . defamatory data” about her to others ).  \nGiven the liberal pleading standard and for the sake of completeness, the court considers the claims.  Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 10 of 1411 \n “unlawfully furnished data to others about [her] in an effort to disqualify [her] from being referred \nto employers.”  (ECF No. 1-1 ¶ 29.)   However, Plaintiff concedes that “[d]iscovery is needed to \nascertain if any defamatory or other inaccurate information” was used —thus admitting that she \nhas no factual basis  beyond speculation to support her claim that such data was furnished to others.  \nId.  This is further illustrated by Plaintiff’s  failure to identify the purported defamatory information  \ndisseminated.  Further , elsewhere in the Complaint, Plaintiff  identifies a different purported motive \nfor Defendants’ actions: unlawfully furnishing data about her for their own profit.  Id. ¶ 21.  S imply \nspeculating something is true with no supportive factual allegations is insufficient to support a \nclaim for relief.  See Twombly , 550 U.S. at  555 (“Factual allegations must be enough to raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level. ”); McCleary-Evans v. Maryland Dep’t of Transp., State  \nHighway Admi n., 780 F.3d 582, 588 (4th Cir. 2015) (noting that, where a complaint left “open to \nspeculation” the cause of defendant’s employment decision, the cause was not plausible in light of the “obvious alternative explanation”).  Finally, p erhaps most fatal to her claim, Plaintiff has not \nalleged any connection between the purported adverse action and her protected activity beyond the conclusory allegation that Defendants  did so “because” she filed the EEOC complaint.  (ECF No. \n1-1 ¶ 29.)   The court cannot accep t the conclusory allegation as true.  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 \n(“Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory \nstatements, do not suffice.”).  The court thus  concludes  that, to the extent she intended to assert \none, Plaintiff has failed to state a claim of retaliation  in violation of Title VII or the ADEA.  \nC.

Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 11 of 1412 \n v. Sandler Sys, Inc., No. ELH -09-3102, 2017 WL 1862445, at *32 (D. Md. May 8, 2017) (quoting \nSass v.  Andrew , 152 Md. App. 406, 432 (2003)).  “In alleging fraud or mistake, a party must state \nwith particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake.”  F ED. R. CIV. P. 9(b).   Plaintiff \n“must, at a minimum, describe the time, place, and contents of the false representations, as well as \nthe identity of the person making the misrepresentation and what he obtained thereby.”  Bourgeois \nv. Live Nation Entertainment  Inc., 3 F. Supp. 3d 423, 435 (D. Md. 2014) (quoting U.S. ex rel . \nOwens v. First Kuwaiti Gen’l Trading & Contracting Co., 612 F.3d 724, 731 (4th Cir. 2010)).  This is often “referred to as the ‘who, what, when, where, and how’ of the alleged fraud.”  U.S. ex \nrel. Wilson  v. Kellogg Brown  & Root, Inc. , 525 F.3d 370, 379 (4th Cir. 2008) (citation omitted).  \n“The tort of fraudulent inducement ‘means that one has been led by another ’s guile, \nsurreptitiousness or other form of deceit to enter into an agreement to his detriment.’” Rozen  v. \nGreenberg,  165 Md. App. 665, 674 (2005) (quoting Sec.  Constr. Co. v. Maietta, 25 Md. App. 303, \n307 (1975)).  To succeed on a claim of fraudulent inducement, Plaintiff must demonstrate :  \n(1) that the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff,  \n(2) that its falsity was either k nown to the defendant or that the \nrepresentation was made with reckless indifference as to its truth,  (3) that the misrepresentation was made for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiff,  (4) that the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation and had the right to rely on it, and  (5) that the plaintiff suffered compensable injury resulting from the misrepresentation.   \nCapitalSource Fin., LLC v. Delco  Oil, Inc., 608 F. Supp. 2d 655, 666 (D. Md. 2009)  (quoting Nails  \nv. S & R, Inc., 334 Md. 398, 415 (1994) ).  “Notably, ‘ fraud cannot be predicated on statements \nwhich are merely promissory in nature, or upon expressions as to what will happen in the future.’”  \nView  Point Med.  Sys., LLC v. Athena Health, Inc., 9 F. Supp. 3d 588, 612 (D. Md. 2014)  (quoting \nSass, 152 Md. App. at 438)).  “In fraudulent inducement cases, a defrauded party may elect Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 12 of 1413 \n between two remedies, which are exclusive [:] . . . to rescind the contract or to ratify the contract \nand seek damages, either affirmatively or by recoupment.”  Id.    \n Here,  Plaintiff’s allegations are , again , insufficient, especially considering the heightened \npleading standard under Rule 9(b).  Plaintiff has not alleged that she  was induced to enter any sort \nof agreement to her detriment.  See Rozen, 165 Md. App. at 674, supra.  She has instead alleged , \nat most,  that she was induc ed to send her resume to Ms. Catone.  (ECF No. 1- 1 ¶ 30; ECF No. 10 \nat p. 11.)  Neither of the “exclusive” remedies that exist to redress unlawful fraudulent inducement \nwould have any effect here.  See View  Point Med.  Sys., LLC, 9 F. Supp. 3d at  612, supra.  E ven \nassuming arguendo that an agreement exist s, Plaintiff still fails to plead the necessary elements of \na fraudulent inducement claim.  As best the court can tell, the alleged false representations she \nasserts were that Ms. Catone would provide Plaintiff’s  resume for consideration for two \nemployment positions and that “neither received [her] resume.”  (ECF No. 1 -1 ¶ 30. )  However, \nPlaintiff does not allege that Ms. Catone never provided her resume to Uber or Zendesk; she alleges \nthat the Chief Privacy Officers for each employer stated either that there was no opening (despite \nan online job posting) or, most notably, that the position had been filled.  Id. ¶¶ 7–10.  Simply \nbecause the employers stated that they did not have an opening or that a position had been filled \ndoes not raise a plausible inference that a recruiter sought out Plaintiff’s resume either falsely or \nwith reckless indifference to the truth and misrepresented the availability of positions for the \npurpose of defrauding her.  See McCleary-Evans , 780 F.3d at  588, supra.11  The court thus finds \nthat Plaintiff has failed  to state a claim for fraudulent inducement under Maryland law.  \nD. Remaining Allegatio ns \nThe court does not  discern any additional claims in Plaintiff’s Complaint.  To the extent \n \n11 Because Plaintiff’s claim is facially insufficient, the court  need not address Plaintiff’s assertion  of “intrusion upon \nprivacy” as her  compensable  injury, but does note that the assertion is again  based  entirely  on speculation .   Case 1:23-cv-02102-JRR   Document 17   Filed 05/10/24   Page 13 of 1414 \n Plaintiff intended to raise any additional claims or rely on any other allegations to  support her \nclaims addressed herein, such allegations fail as impermissible “shotgun pleading.”  See Baxter , \n617 F. Supp. 3d at  351, supra; Lampkin- Asam , 261 F. App’x at 277, supra.  See also Weller  v. \nDep’t of Soc.

United States , 849 F.2d 273 (7th Cir. 1988).   \nPlaintiff  Gene Thomas Davis filed this civil action against the U.S. Presidential Task Force \n(FBI/DEA) on April 26, 2018. He paid the full filing fee at that time.  The complaint alleges that \nMr. Davis is a resident of Greenfield, Indiana.

A complaint is frivolous if “ ‘it \nlacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact. ’” McLean v. United State s, 566 F.3d 391, 399 (4th \nCir. 2009) (quoting Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989)). Unlike the failure to state a \nclaim standard, however, in reviewing for frivolity, the Court “is not bound to accept ‘clearly \nbaseless’ factual allegations as tru e.” Kilgore -Bey v. Rudey, No. RDB -18-0007, 2018 WL \n1135391, at *2 (D. Md. Feb. 28, 2018).  Frivolous claims include “those whose factual allegations \nare ‘so nutty,’ ‘delusional,’ or ‘wholly fanciful’ as to be simply ‘unbelievable.’” McLean , 566 F.3d \nat 399 (quoting Gladney v. Pendleton Corr. Facility , 302 F.3d 773, 774 (7th Cir. 2002); see Denton \nv. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 29 (1992)).   \nIII.  Discussion  \nHere, the allegations asserted reflect fantasy or delusional thinking that cannot be addressed \nby the C ourt.  Plaintiff  has provided no information to conclude  that some plausible cause of action \n \n1 Additionally, plaintiff has  attached copies of medical bills for various services at a number \nof medical facilities and other papers , without explanation. See, e.g ., ECF 1 -1 at 1 -3, 8-13, 16 -19, \n22- 25. Case 1:21-cv-01836-ELH   Document 3   Filed 08/03/21   Page 2 of 33 \n has accrued on her behalf.  I note , too, that  plaintiff  has previous ly presented  several of the  same \nor similar allegations  and they  were dismissed as frivolous. See Smith v. U.S, Department of  \nDefense, Civil Action No. ELH -21-1542 (D. Md. July 9, 2021) (dismissing claims , including that \ndefendants had attempted to “ bully” plain tiff by using AI  and a military jet flew overhead and \nseconds later an odorless chemical entered her body).   \nI recognize the Court’s obligation to construe  liberally the pleadings  of self -represented \nlitigants . See Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) .  Even after liberal construction, however, \nthe C omplaint  fails to set forth a plausible claim and is frivolous.  \nIV.  Conclusion  \n For these reasons, I will dismiss the C omplaint.  A separate O rder follows.  \n \n      _____/s/ _______________ \n      Ellen L.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   In the case of Park v. Kim, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Minhye Park's action against David Dennis Kim due to her persistent non-compliance with court orders. The case involved issues related to the use of artificial intelligence, as Park’s attorney admitted to using ChatGPT to generate a citation to a non-existent legal case, contributing to the dismissal of the appeal.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The key legal issue is whether the district court appropriately dismissed Park's case due to her willful failure to adhere to court-ordered discovery obligations per Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 37 and 41(b).\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The Court affirmed the dismissal of Park's action, finding that her conduct constituted willful non-compliance with court orders despite clear warnings regarding the consequences. The Court also addressed the misconduct of Park’s counsel, who cited a fictitious case generated by ChatGPT, by referring her to the Court's Grievance Panel.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you have to follow a set of rules in a game, but you keep ignoring them, even when the referee warns you repeatedly. Eventually, you're kicked out of the game. That's what happened here with Park’s court case—she ignored the rules and orders, so the court didn't allow her case to continue. Additionally, her lawyer tried to use a made-up rule from a chatbot to defend her, which also got her into trouble with the court.",

Kim   \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nFor the Second Circuit  \n \n \nAugust Term 20 23 \n \nSubmitted :  December 15 , 2023  \nDecided:  January 30, 2024  \n \nNo. 22-2057  \n \n \nMINHYE PARK, \n \nPlaintiff-Appellant , \n \nv. \n \nDAVID DENNIS KIM, \n \nDefendant-Appellee,  \n \n \n \nAppeal from the United States District Court \nfor the Eastern  District of New York  \nNo. 20CV 02636, Pamela  K. Chen, Judge.   \n \n \nBefore: PARKER , NATHAN , and  MERRIAM , Circuit Judges.  \n \n Plaintiff -Appellant Minhye Park appeals from an August 25, 2022, judgment \nof the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Chen, J. ) \ndismissing her action against Defendant -Appellee David Dennis Kim, pursuant to \nRule s 37 and 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedur e, for her persistent and \nknowing violation of court orders . The record demonstrates Park’s sustained and \nwillful intransigence  in spite of repeated warnings that failure to comply would \nresult in the dismissal of the  action . Accordingly, we AFFIRM  the judgment of \ndismissal .  \n Case 22-2057, Document 178-1, 01/30/2024, 3606898, Page1 of 122 \n  We separately address the fact that Park’s counsel, Attorney Jae S. Lee, has \nadmitted to citing a non -existent state court decision in her reply brief to this \nCourt. Counsel reports that she relied on a generative artificial intelligence tool, \nChatGPT, to identify precedent that might support her arguments, and did not \nread or otherwise confirm the validity of the (non -existent) decision she cited. \nBecause  this conduct falls well below the basic obligations of counsel, we refer \nAttorney Lee to the Court’s Grievance Panel , and further ORDER Attorney Lee to \nfurnish a copy of this decision to her client. \n \n \nJAE S. LEE, JSL Law Offices P.C., Uniondale, NY, \nfor Plaintiff-Appellant . \n \nALEJANDRA R. GIL, Heidell, Pittoni, Murphy & \nBach, LLP, White Plains, NY, for Defendant-\nAppellee.  \n \nPER CURIAM : \nPlaintiff -Appellant  Minhye Park appeals from the  August 25, 2022, \njudgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York \n(Chen, J.) dismissing her action against Defendant -Appellee David Dennis Kim , \npursuant to Rule s 37 and 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We \nassume the parties’ familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and \nissues on appeal, to which we refer only as necessary to explain our decision to \naffirm the District C ourt’s judgment.  \nWe separately address the conduct of Park’s counsel, Attorney Jae S. Lee.  \nLee’s reply brief in this case includes a citation to a non -existent case, which she Case 22-2057, Document 178-1, 01/30/2024, 3606898, Page2 of 123 \n admits she  generated  using  the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT. Because \ncitation in a brief to a non -existent case suggests conduct that  falls below the \nbasic obligations of counsel, we refer Attorney Lee to the Court’s Grievance \nPanel, and further direct Attorney Lee to furnish a copy of this decision to her client, Plaintiff -Appellant Park.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW  \n “We review a district court ’s imposition of sanctions for abuse of \ndiscretion.” Wolters Kluwer Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Scivantage , 564 F.3d 110, 113 (2d \nCir. 2009); s ee also  Agiwal v. Mid Island Mortg. Corp., 555 F.3d 298, 302 (2d Cir. \n2009) (dismissal pursuant to Rule 37); Baptiste v. Sommers , 768 F.3d 212, 216 (2d \nCir. 2014) (dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b)).   \nRULE 37 AND RULE 41(b)  \nRule  37 provides : “If a party . . . fails to obey an order to provide or permit \ndiscovery . . . the court where the action is pending may issue further just orders . . . [including] dismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in part.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(v). Dism issal under Rule 37 is appropriate “only when a court \nfinds willfulness, bad faith, or any fault” by the non -compliant litigant. Bobal v. \nRensselaer Polytechnic Inst. , 916 F.2d 759, 764 (2d Cir. 1990) (citation and Case 22-2057, Document 178-1, 01/30/2024, 3606898, Page3 of 124 \n quotation marks omitted). “Whether a litigant was at fault or acted willfully or in \nbad faith are questions of fact, and we review the District Court’s determinations \nfor clear error.” Agiwal , 555 F.3d at 302.  \nSeveral factors may be useful in evaluating a district court ’s exercise \nof discretion to dismiss an action under Rule 37. These include : (1) the \nwillfulness of the non -compliant party or the reason for \nnoncompliance; (2) the efficacy of lesser sanctions; (3) the duration of \nthe period of noncompliance, and (4) whether the non -compliant \nparty had been warned of the consequences of . . . noncompliance.  \n \nId. (citation and quotation marks omitted).  \n Rule 41(b) authorizes a district court to dismiss an action “[i]f the plaintiff \nfails to prosecute or to comply with [the] rules or a court order.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n41(b). We consider five factors in reviewing a Rule 41(b) dismissal:  \n(1) the duration of the plaintiff’s failure to comply with the court \norder, (2) whether plaintiff was on notice that failure to comply would \nresult in dismissal, (3) whether the defendants are likely to be \nprejudiced by further delay in the proceedings, (4 ) a balancing of the \ncourt’s interest in managing its docket with the plaintiff’s interest in \nreceiving a fair chance to be heard, and (5) whether the judge has \nadequately considered a sanction less drastic than dismissal.  \n \nLucas v. Miles , 84 F.3d 532, 535 (2d Cir. 1996).  \nDISCUSSION  \n Over the course of th e litigation  before the District Court , Park continually \nand willfully failed to respond to and comply with the D istrict C ourt’s discovery Case 22-2057, Document 178-1, 01/30/2024, 3606898, Page4 of 125 \n orders.  Magistrate  Judge  Bloom  issued numerous discovery orders  and provided \nample warning to Park and her counsel th at timely compliance was expected. For \nexample, at a telephonic conference on August 11, 2021, Judge Bloom granted \nKim ’s motion to compel, warning Attorney Lee: “[Y]our client can be subject to \nsanctions, which could be as severe as dismissal of the case, if she fails to \ncomply.” J. App’x at 81-82.1 On November 29, 2021, Judge Bloom again warned \nof the consequences of non -compliance, in no uncertain terms: “Plaintiff shall \nhave one final opportunity to comply with the Court’s discovery Order  . . . . This \nis a Court Order and plaintiff must comply. This is plaintiff’s last chance.” J. \nApp’x at 7 (emphasis in original) . In that same order, Judge Bloom set a briefing \nschedule for filing a motion to dismiss for non -compliance, should such a motion \nbe necessary. Finally, having still not received the ordered discovery more than seven months after Judge Bloom’s August 2021 order, Kim  moved to dismiss \nbased on Park’s failure to comply with court orders and discovery  obligations . \nSee J. App’x at 292-93.  \n \n1 The written order issued after that conference was also very clear: “ This is a \nCourt Order and plaintiff must comply. Plaintiff is warned that if she fails to \ncomply with the Court’s Order to produce discovery, she may be subject to \nsanctions, which could include dismissal of this action.” J. App’x at 5 (emphasis in original).  Case 22-2057, Document 178-1, 01/30/2024, 3606898, Page5 of 126 \n  In her report and recommendation, Judge Bloom carefully considered all \nof the requirements of Rule 37 and Rule 41(b), including the availability of lesser \nsanctions, and concluded that dismissal was appropriate. Judge Chen, the \npresiding District Judge, r eviewed Park’s objections to the report and \nrecommendation in detail, overruled them, adopted the report and \nrecommendation, and issued an order of dismissal on August 24, 2022.  \n On appeal, Park reiterates her complaints about Kim’s alleged discovery \nabuses, as well as her conclusory assertion that she in fact  complied with the \nrelevant discovery orders . As Judge Bloom and Judge Chen found, these \narguments are meritless, lack foundation in the record, and completely ignor e \nthe actual orders issued by Judge Bloom.  Accordingly, we conclude  that Park’s \nnoncompliance amounted to “sustained and willful intransigence in the face of \nrepeated and explicit warnings from the court that the refusal to comply with \ncourt or ders . . . would result in the dismissal of [the] action.” Valentine v. \nMuseum of Mod. Art , 29 F.3d 47, 50 (2d Cir. 1994). As such, we affirm the \njudgment of the District Court.  \nPLAINTIFF’S IMPROPER BRIEFING BEFORE THIS COURT \nWe must also  address a separate matter concerning the conduct of Park’s Case 22-2057, Document 178-1, 01/30/2024, 3606898, Page6 of 127 \n counsel, Attorney Lee. P ark’s reply brief in this appeal was initially due May 26, \n2023. After seeking and receiving two extensions of time, Attorney Lee filed a \ndefective  reply brief on July 25, 2023, more than a week after the extended due \ndate. On August 1, 2023, this Court notified Attorney Lee that the late -filed brief \nwas defective , and set a deadline of August 9, 2023, by which  to cure the defect \nand resubmit the brief . Attorney Lee did not file a compliant brief, and on \nAugust 14, 2023, this Court ordered the defective reply brief stricken from the \ndocket. Attorney Lee finally filed the  reply brief on September 9, 2023.2  \nThe reply brief cited only two court decisions. We were unable to locate \nthe one cited as “Matter of Bourguignon v. Coordinated Behavioral Health \nServs., Inc., 114 A.D.3d 947 (3d Dep’t 2014).” Appellant’s Reply Br. at 6. \nAccordingly, on November 20, 2023, we ordered  Park to submit a copy of that \ndecision to the Court by November 27, 2023. On November 29, 2023, Attorney \nLee filed a Response with the Court explaining that she was “unable to furnish a \ncopy of the decision .” Response  to November 20, 2023, Order of the Court , at 1, \n \n2 Attorney Lee filed the reply brief together with a motion to reconsider the \nCourt’s prior order striking the non -compliant brief. The Court later granted that \nmotion to reconsider and accepted the September 9, 2023, version of the reply \nbrief.  Case 22-2057, Document 178-1, 01/30/2024, 3606898, Page7 of 128 \n Park v. Kim , No. 22- 2057-cv  (2d Cir. Nov. 29, 2023), ECF No. 172 (hereinafter, \n“Response”). Although Attorney Lee did not expressly indicate  as much in her \nResponse , the reason she could not provide a copy of the case is that it does no t \nexist  – and indeed, Attorney Lee refers to the case at one point as “this non -\nexistent case.” Id. at 2.   \nAttorney Lee’s Response states:  \nI encountered difficulties in locating a relevant case to establish a \nminimum wage for an injured worker lacking prior year income \nrecords for compensation determination  . . . . Believing that applying \nthe minimum wage to in injured worker in such circumstances under workers’ compensation law was uncontroversial, I invested \nconsiderable time searching for a case to support this position but was \nunsuccessful.  \n. . .  \nConsequently, I utilized the ChatGPT service, to which I am a subscribed and paying member, for assistance in case identification. ChatGPT was previously provided reliable information, such as \nlocating sources for finding an antic furniture key. The case \nmentioned above was suggested by ChatGPT, I wish to clarify that I \ndid not cite any specific reasoning or decision from this case.  \n \nId. at 1-2 (sic).  \nAll counsel that appear before this Court are bound to exercise \nprofessional judgment and responsibility , and to comply with the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure. Among other obligations , Rule 11 provides that by presenting \na submission to the court, an attorney “certifies that to the best of the person ’s Case 22-2057, Document 178-1, 01/30/2024, 3606898, Page8 of 129 \n knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under \nthe circumstances . . .  the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are \nwarranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument  for extending, \nmodifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2); see also  N.Y. R. Pro. Conduct 3.3(a) (McKinney 2023) (“A lawyer shall \nnot knowingly : (1) make a false statement of . . . law to a tribunal.”). “Rule \n11 imposes a duty on attorneys to certify th at they have conducted a reasonable \ninquiry and have determined that any papers filed with the court are well grounded in fact, [and] legally tenable.” Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 \nU.S. 384, 393 (1990). “Under Rule 11, a court may sanction an attorney for, among \nother things, misrepresenting facts or making frivolous legal arguments.” \nMuhammad v. Walmart Stores E., L.P., 732 F.3d 104, 108 (2d Cir. 2013) (per \ncuriam ).  \nAt the very least, the  duties imposed by Rule 11 require that attorneys \nread, and thereby confirm the existence  and validity of, the legal authorities  on \nwhich they rely.  Indeed, we can think of no other way to ensure that the \narguments made based on those authorities are  “warranted by existing law,” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2), or otherwise  “legally tenable .” Cooter & Gell , 496 U.S. at Case 22-2057, Document 178-1, 01/30/2024, 3606898, Page9 of 1210 \n 393. As a District Judge  of this Circuit recently held when presented  with non-\nexistent precedent generated by ChatGPT: “ A fake opinion is not ‘existing law’ \nand citation to a fake opinion does not provide a non -frivolous ground for \nextending, modifying, or reversing existing law, or for establishing new law . An \nattempt to persuade a court or oppose an adversary by relying on fake opinions \nis an abuse of the adversary system.” Mata v. Avianca, Inc., No. \n22CV01461(PKC), 2023 WL 4114965, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 2023).  \nAttorney Lee states that “it is important to recognize that ChatGPT \nrepresents a significant technological advancement,” and  argues that “[i]t would \nbe prudent for the court to advise legal professionals to exercise caution when \nutilizing this new technology.” Response  at 2. Indeed, s everal courts have  \nrecently  proposed or enacted local rules or orders  specifically addressing the use \nof artificial intelligence tools  before the court.3 But such a rule is not necessary  to \n \n3 See, e.g. , Notice of Proposed Amendment to 5th Cir.

The court found that while AI-assisted transcription might be cost-effective, it raised privacy concerns and did not meet the standards of using a certified court reporter, lacking in professional oversight and compliance with the protective order regarding confidential information.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiff is allowed to conduct depositions using real-time voice recognition technology provided by an AI platform, replacing traditional certified stenographers, and have the resulting transcripts certified and used in legal proceedings.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the plaintiff’s motion to use AI-assisted transcription for the deposition process, citing concerns over privacy, the lack of formal certification and training of the videographer as a deposition officer, and the potential violation of the protective order concerning confidential information.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you want to record conversations at your friend's big party and use a new computer program that hears and types everything for you, so you don't have to write it down.

(ECF No. 153.)   \nPlaintiff moves the court for  leave to conduct his  remaining depositions in this matter \n“befo re Casey Stark, Notary Public and Videographer, and use real- time voice recognition \nsoftware  . . . for transcript preparation during or following the deposition.”  ( Id. at 1. )  \nDefendant City of San Diego and the individual defendants other than Alyssa Tut terow \nfiled an opposition (ECF No s. 160 , 164, 171) which Defendant Alyssa Tutterow then Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 1 of 8 \n2 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 joined (ECF No. 162) .

For the reasons set forth below,  Plaintiff’s Motion is \nDENIED. \nI.  BACKGROUND  \nA.  Factual Background  \nOn November 27, 2021, Plaintiff commenced this civil rights action against the City \nof San Diego, San Diego Police Department, San Diego County, the San Diego Sherriff’s Department, and a number of individual officers (“ the Officer Defendants”).  (ECF No. 1.)  \nOn March 5, 2024, Plaintiff filed the operative complaint, the Third Amended Complaint, \nagainst the City of San Diego and the Officer Defendants (collectively, “Defendants”) .  \n(ECF No. 76 (“TAC”).)  The TAC contains the following causes of action: assault, battery, \nfalse imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, trespass to chattels, invasion of privacy, computer fraud and abuse, negligence, violation of Cal. Civil Code § 52.1(a), violation of Cal. Civil Code § 51.7, violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983, including false \narrest, equal protection and due process, excessive force, unreasonable search, retaliation, and Monell  claims based on official policy and custom and failure to train.  (TAC at 46 –\n95.) \nB.  Background of Instant Motion   \nDuring the Court’s March 21, 2025, Status Conference, Plaintiff’s counsel stated his \nintent to file the instant motion.  (ECF No. 149.)  Plaintiff then filed the present Motion on March 27, 2025.  (ECF No. 153.)   The City of San Diego and the Officer Defendants \nopposed.  (ECF No s. 160 , 162. )  On April 2, 2025, the Court informed Defendants that the \nlink provided to the City of San Diego’s Information Technology Policy on Artificial Intelligence and Generative Artificial Intelligence Policy in their opposition required authorization and ordered Defendants to file the policy  as a supplement to their opposition .  \n(ECF No 163.)  T hey immediately did so.  (ECF No. 164.)  Plaintiff filed a reply on \nApril  2, 2025.  (ECF No. 165.)  Additionally, on April 2, 2025, the Court ordered Plaintiff Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 2 of 8 \n3 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 to file a supplement which identified a sampling of cases in which Casey Stark acted as a \ndeposition videographer in federal courts in California.  (ECF No. 166.)  A Status \nConference was held on April  2, 2025, to discuss the Motion .  (ECF No. 168.)  During the \nStatus Conference, Defendants were ordered to supplement their opposition to include any additional information for the Court’s consideration.  (ECF No. 169.)  Plaintiff filed a \nsecond supplemental declaration of Casey Stark  on April 4, 2025 (ECF No. 170) , and \nDefendants filed their second supplement to their opposition on April 9, 2025 (ECF No. 171).   \nPlaintiff seeks leave to conduct depositions in this action before Casey Stark, who is \na Notary Public and Videographer, and for  an order approving the use of transcripts of \nthose depositions, which would initially be generated by  the real-time voice recognition \nsoftware Zoom AI Companion and subsequently reviewed, revised (as necessary ), and \ncertified by Mr. Stark, for all purposes, including motions practice  and trial.  (ECF Nos. \n153 at 1 –2; 165 at 2.)   \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \n The Court has broad authority to manage the discovery process under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 26, which expressly allows the Court to enter orders to manage \ndiscovery to avoid undue burden and expenses.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(1).  Fe deral Rule of \nCivil Procedure  30 governs the procedure by which depositions are taken by oral \nexamination and imposes certain requirements.   Specifically, “[a] party who wants to \ndepose a person by oral questions must give reasonable written notice to ever y other party.”   \nFed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(1).   “The party who notices the deposition must state in the notice the \nmethod for recording the testimony.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(3)(A).  “Unless the court orders \notherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. ”  Id. \n“[A] deposition must be conducted before an officer appointed or designated under \nRule 28,” u nless the parties stipulate otherwise.   Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(5)(A).  “Within the \nUnited States, . . . a deposition must be taken before: (A) an officer authorized to administer \noaths either by federal law or by the law in the place of examination; or (B) a person Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 3 of 8 \n4 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 appointed by the court where the action is pending to administer oaths and take testimony.”  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 28(a)(1).  The officer must “certify in writing that the witness was duly \nsworn and that the deposition accurately records the witness's testimony.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n30(f)(1).   Notably, the existence of confidential materials, “propels the task of videotaping \na deposition beyond a simple task to a complicated one.”  Schoolcraft v. City of New York , \n296 F.R.D. 231, 2 40 (S.D.N.Y.  Nov. 21,  2013) . \nThe noticing party must bear costs of recording the deposition.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n30(b)(3)(A).   Moreover, while “ [p]laintiff ’s in forma pauperis  status entitles him to a \nwaiver of the filing fee and free service of process by United States Marshals . . . it does \nnot entitle him to waiver of witness fees, mileage or deposition officer fe es.”  Jackson v. \nWoodford , No. CIV 05CV0513- L NLS, 2007 WL 2580566, at *1 (S.D. Cal. Aug. 17, 2007) \n(citing 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a) and Tedder v. Odel , 890 F.2d 210, 211 (9th Cir. 1989)).    \nIII.  DISCUSSION   \n Plaintiff requests that the Court approve Casey Stark “to act as a deposition officer ,” \nthat the remaining depositions be “ recorded by Voice Recognition Technology, ” that Mr. \nStark be able to “certify the transcripts of the depositions he has presided over ,” and that \nthose transcripts “ so properly certifi ed be admissible for the purposes of motions, \ncompliance with Rule 26, and usable at trial.”  (ECF No. 153 at 4.)  \n Plaintiff contends that “there is no requirement” that “grants a monopoly to certified \nstenographers to prepare transcripts of proceedings in federal court.”  ( Id. at 2.)  Plaintiff \nasserts that financial barriers limit his access to a traditional certified stenographic court \nreporter because Plaintiff is “essentially indigent ,” so Plaintiff’s counsel has been \nadvancing litigation expenses  and there are at least thirteen more depositions  to be taken .  \n(Id. at 3, 5.)   For the four depositions already conducted, Plaintiff’s counsel estimates the \naverage cost was approximately  $4,000  apiece.  ( Id. at 5.)  Plaintiff’s counsel has \ncontracted with Mr. Stark, a professional legal videographer who holds a Notary Public \ncommission,  at an estimated rate of about $1,455 per seven- hour deposition, inclusive of \ntranscript and exhibits.   (Id . at 6 –7.)  Plaintiff argues that Mr. Stark is an experie nced Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 4 of 8 \n5 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 professional legal videographer, court reporters already utilize artificial intelligence (“AI”)  \ntools to assist in transcription, and Mr. Stark will be proofreading and personally certifying \nthe transcript produced by the Zoom AI Companion as a verbatim recording which is “the \nsame function and objective as a shorthand reporter.”  (ECF No. 165 at 1 –2.)   \n Defendants do not oppose Mr. Stark acting as a videographer or deposition officer, \nbut rather oppose Mr. Stark utilizing the Zoom AI Companion to create a transcript of the \ndeposition and then certifying the transcript without having the necessary qualific ations  of \na court reporter.  (ECF No. 171 at 1.)  Defendants argue  that allowing  AI tools access to \nsensitive, confidential information raise s privacy and data protection concerns .  (ECF No s. \n160 at 2; 171 at 2.)  Defendants contend that the City of San Diego ’s Information \nTechnology Policy on Artificial Intelligence and Generative Artificial Intelligence Policy “prohibit s submission of any sensitive, confidential, regulated, or [personal identifying \ninformation] to generative AI technology platforms without appropriate internal controls and processes.”  (ECF Nos. 160 at 2; 164 at 9.)  Defendants also argue that the Protective \nOrder (ECF Nos. 32, 156) issued in this case do es not allow for confidential information \nsuch as police personnel files and confidential internal affairs investigations to be provided \nto a third- party AI platform .  (ECF No s. 160 at 2; 171 at 2 .)  Defendants further argue that \nMr. Stark is not qualified to certify a transcript, and they express the concern that a \n“recording and AI transc ription will not accurately capture” nuances that “certified court \nreporters (or transcriptionists) are trained to handle and have experience handling.”  (ECF No. 171 at 3.)  Defendants assert that a certified court reporter or transcriptionist should be \nused.  ( Id. at 1–2.) \nFor the reasons set forth below, the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to utilize Mr. \nStark in the capacity of deposition officer/transcriptionist .  \nFirst, the Court notes that while Mr. Stark is a professional legal videographer , he \nhas not served as a d eposition officer before.  (ECF No. 170 at 2.)  Although  Mr. Stark \nasserts that he is planning to take the Certified Deposition Reporter (“CDR”) exam, he has \nnot yet passed the exam.  (Id . at 4.)  Moreover, as Defendan ts point out,   passing the CDR Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 5 of 8 \n6 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 exam would allow Mr. Stark  “to capture[] the record by digitally recording depositions” \nbut it would “not allow him to certify a transcript.”  (ECF No. 171 at 2 .)  To certify \ntranscripts on e must have a  Certified Electronic T ranscriber Certificate.  (Id .)  As other \ncourts have  noted , court reporters and videographers typically have different roles in a \ndeposition  and require different certifications and/or training .  See  Alcorn v. City of \nChicago , 336 F.R.D. 440, 443 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 20, 2020) (“The court reporter in this case \nwho will stenographically record and transcribe the deposition has declined to certify the \naccuracy of the Zoom recording as it is not his function. Rather, it is a certified videographer who has the appropriate training[.] ”)). \n Next, although Plaintiff contends that Mr. Stark will be proofreading the material \nproduced by the Zoom AI Companion and will personally be certifying the transcript as a verbatim recording (ECF No. 165 at 2) , as Defendants  highlight, a court reporter’s role is \nmore complex and nuanced than that.  For example, c ourt reporters have additional duties \nand responsibilities during the course of the deposition, such as reminding participants to \nnot speak over one another, clarif ying names, acronyms, and other unfamiliar terminology , \nand requesting the spelling of names and words, all with the goal of having a clear record.  \n(ECF No. 171 at 3.)  The Court agrees that a recording plu s AI transcription does not fulfill \nall the roles t hat court reporters are trained in and have experience handling.  Mr. Stark \nasserts that the Zoom AI Companion allows him to make real- time modifications and \n“train” the program while the testimony is being given.  (ECF No. 153 -1 at 2.)  However, \nthis practice is untested in a real-life deposition setting and could lead to unanticipated \ndelays and problems .  In addition, a s Defendants assert, if a party has a problem with a \ncourt reporter’s services, there is “some oversight, regulation, and a complaint process” \n(ECF No. 171 at 2), but Mr. Stark is not overseen by a licensing agency to whom \nDefendants can turn with complaints.   Although Mr. Stark may well possess, or could \nacquire, the skills  that a court reporter brings to bear, he has not been for mally trained in \nthe duties of a court reporter , he has not been certified, and he does not yet have experience Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 6 of 8 \n7 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 serving as a deposition officer.1 \n Furthermore, the Court finds that Defendants have expressed legitimate concerns \nabout giving Zoom’s AI platform access to sensitive, confidential information.  Plaintiff \nargues that the Zoom AI Companion does not use any “customer  content ” to train Zoom \nand its AI models.  (ECF No. 165 at 2.)  In making this assertion, Plaintiff relies on the \nfollowing  language from Zoom’s website :  \n“Data from users’ interactions with the AI Companion features may be \naccessed, processed, and used by Zoom to provide and maintain the services, troubleshoot issues, and provide support.  Zoom does not use any of your \naudio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments or other communications-like customer content (such as poll results, whiteboard and reactions) to train Zoom’s or its third- party artificial intelligence models.  This commitment  \nincludes the content mentioned in the chart above, such as audio transcripts, \nused to provide the service.”  \n \n \n(Id.)  However, it is not clear from this disclaimer how the data will be “accessed, \nprocessed, and used by Zoom to provide and maintain [] services, troubleshoot is sues, and \nprovide support.”  ( Id.)  Defendants  contend  that the Zoom AI Companion uses “ third-\nparty artificial intelligence models provided by unknown subprocessors, ” and it is no t \nknown if the data is stored or how it is stored.  (ECF No. 171 at 2 .)  This is especially \ntroubling in the instant case , as discovery and probable  deposition questions  involve \nconfidential material including personnel f iles and internal affairs investigations.   (ECF \nNo. 160 at 2.)   The Court finds that providing information designated as \n“CONFIDENTIAL” or “CONFIDENTIAL  – FOR COUNSEL ONLY” in the Protective \nOrder (ECF No. 156) to a third-party platform , especially when it is not transparent how \n/// \n \n1  This is not to say that Mr. Stark, or someone else with his experience and \nskills, aided by AI transcription software, would not be an appropriate deposition officer in a different case.  For all of the reasons addressed in this order, though, this is not the \nright case.  Case 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 7 of 8 \n8 \n21-cv-01990- RBM -JLB 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 the information will be stored and used, violates the Protective Order  and is not justified in \nthis case .  \n The Court finally notes that, generally, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow \neach party in a case to take a total of ten depositions, limited to one day of seven hours  \neach.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(2)(A)(i); 30(d)(1).   Here, Plaintiff has conducted \ndepositions of four individuals and is opting to take at least thirteen  more.  (ECF No. 153 \nat 5.)  Plaintiff has argued  that th e Motion  should be granted because taking depositions in \nthe traditional manner is very expensive, but Plaintiff has not demonstrated that taki ng this \nmany depositions is necessary for the prosecution of his claims.    \nBecause the Court denies Plaintiff’s request to conduct depositions utilizing  Casey \nStark  as the creator and certifier of the transcripts, the Court need not address the aspect of \nthe Motion requesting an order approving the use of such transcripts for purposes of \nmotions practice and trial.  \nIV. CONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff ’s Motion  is DENIED. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  May 2, 2025   \n \n \nCase 3:21-cv-01990-RBM-JLB     Document 172     Filed 05/02/25     PageID.<pageID> \nPage 8 of 8",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Lonnie Allbaugh filed a lawsuit against the University of Scranton, alleging discrimination. The court dismissed his complaint and sanctioned him $1,000 for violating the admissibility rules, specifically citing a fictitious case generated by AI. Allbaugh's motion for reconsideration was denied as it was untimely and did not address any clear errors or new evidence to merit a different outcome.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the sanction imposed on Allbaugh for citing a fictitious case created by generative AI is justified.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Allbaugh's motion for reconsideration, upholding the sanction because he failed to correct his misconduct, did not comply with procedural rules, and lacked a basis for altering the court's prior decision.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A person named Lonnie Allbaugh used a story about a court case that wasn't real, made up by a computer, to try and win his own case against a university. The court decided his complaint wasn't valid and fined him $1,000 because people aren't allowed to use fake information in court. When he asked the court to change its mind, they said no because he didn't follow the rules and didn't show any new information to change their opinion.",

( Doc. 1 ). On May 15, 2025, Magistrate Judge Susan E. \nSchwab issued a report and recommendation (the “Report”) recommending that the Court \ndismiss Allbaugh’s complaint,  but that Allbaugh be granted leave to amend. ( Doc. 13 ). On \nJune 2, 2025, Allbaugh filed a memorandum objecting to the Report. ( Doc. 14 -1). In that \nmemorandum, Allbaugh provided the following fictitious citation: Dreibelbis v. City of Reading , \nNo. 23 -1800, 2024 WL 188858 (3d Cir. Jan. 17, 2024). ( Doc. 14 -1, at 9 -10). On August 28, \n2025, the Court issued an Order adopting the Report and sanctioning  Allbaugh  $1,000.00  for \nviolating the Court’s local rules, the Court’s standing order on the use of generative artificial \nintelligence , and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure  11. (Doc. 20 ). Before the Court is Allbaugh’s \nmotion for reconsideration regarding the Court’s sanction. ( Doc. 22 ). For the following \nreasons, the Court DENIES  Allbaugh’s motion . \nI. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nSince the Court’s previous Memorandum correctly state s the procedural and factual \nbackground of this case, it will not be repeated in its entirety here. ( Doc. 9 ). Allbaugh initiated \nthis action on December 26, 2024, by filing a complaint alleging that the University of Case 3:24-cv-02237-KM-SES     Document 29     Filed 10/31/25     Page 1 of 6 \n2 Scranton discriminated against him on the basis of his sex. ( Doc. 1 ). On February 4, 2025, \nthe University of Scranton filed a motion to dismiss , which Judge S chwab recommended the \nCourt grant . (Doc. 7 ; Doc. 13 ). On June 2, 2025, Allbaugh filed an amended complaint along \nwith a memorandum  that the Court interpreted as an objection to the Report. ( Doc. 14 ; Doc. \n14-1; Doc. 19, at 3 ). In that memorandum, Allbaugh included the following citation: Dreibelbis \nv. City of Reading , No. 23 -1800, 2024 WL 188858 (3d Cir. Jan. 17, 2024). ( Doc. 14 -1, at 9 ). \nAllbaugh also included quotations he claimed were attributable to Dreibelbis v. City of Reading . \n(Doc. 14 -1, at 10 ). On June 16, 2025, the University of Scranton filed a response to Allbaugh’s \nobjection , stating  that Dreibelbis v. City of Reading  did not exist. ( Doc. 15, at 14 -15). On June \n25, 2025, the Court issued an order to show cause directing Allbaugh to explain why his \ncitation to a fictious case does not violate the Court’s standing order on the use of generative \nartificial intelligence , the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Pennsylvania Rules for \nProfessional Conduct. ( Doc. 16 ). On July 1, 2025, Allbaugh filed a response in which he \nadmitted that he relied on generative artificial intelligence , and claimed  that the citation to \nDreibelbis v. City of Reading , an unreported Third Circuit case, was meant to be a citation to \nDreibelbis v. County of Berks , 438 F. Supp. 3d 304 (E.D. Pa. 2020) , a reported Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania case. ( Doc. 17 ). On August 28, 2025, the Court issued a Memorandum and \nOrder adopting the Report, dismissing Allbaugh’s complaint without prejudice, and \nsanctioning Allbaugh $1,000.00 for violating the local rules, the Court’s standing order on the \nuse of generative artificial intelligence, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . (Doc. 19 ; \nDoc. 20 ). On September 26, 2025, Allbaugh filed a motion for reconsideration. ( Doc. 22 ). On \nOctober 10, 2025, the University of Scranton filed a brief in opposition. ( Doc. 24 ). Allbaugh \ndid not file a timely reply brief. Accordingly, this matter is fully briefed and ripe for disposition  Case 3:24-cv-02237-KM-SES     Document 29     Filed 10/31/25     Page 2 of 6 \n3 II. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA motion for reconsideration is a device of limited utility which may only be used to \ncorrect manifest errors of law or fact or to present newly discovered precedent or evidence. \nHarasco Corp. v. Zlotnicki , 779 F.2d 906, 909 (3d Cir. 1985) . To prevail, a party seeking \nreconsideration must demonstrate one of the following: “(1) an intervening change in the \ncontrolling law; (2) the availability of new evidence that was not available when the court \ngranted the motion  . . . ; or (3) the need to  correct a clear error of law or fact or to prevent \nmanifest injustice.” Max’s Seafood Café ex rel. Lou -Ann, Inc. v. Quinteros , 176 F.3d 669, 677 (3d \nCir. 1999) . “Because federal courts have a strong interest in the finality of judgments, motions \nfor reconsideration should be granted sparingly.” Continental Cas. Co. v. Diversified Indus ., Inc., \n884 F. Supp. 937, 943 (E.D. Pa. 1995) . \nIII. DISCUSSION  \nIn his motion for reconsideration , Allbaugh  avers that the Court should either \neliminate or reduce the sanction it imposed because his erroneous citation was not in bad \nfaith, his pro se  status merits mitigation, the sanction is not narrowly tailored to deter future \nmisconduct, and other district courts have declined to impose sanctions where a party cited \nto nonexistent cases. ( Doc. 22, at 5 -8). The Court rejects Allbaugh’s motion for three  reasons. \nFirst, Allbaugh’s motion for reconsideration is untimely under the local rules. Under Local \nRule 7.10, “[a]ny  motion for reconsideration . . . must be accompanied by a supporting brief  \nand filed within fourteen (14) days after the entry of the order concerned. ” The Court issued \nits Order sanctioning Allbaugh on August 28, 2025. ( Doc. 20 ). Allbaugh did not file his Case 3:24-cv-02237-KM-SES     Document 29     Filed 10/31/25     Page 3 of 6 \n4 motion for reconsideration until September 26, 2025, twenty -nine days after the Court’s \norder.1 (Doc. 22 ). \nSecond, even if Allbaugh’s motion were timely, it fails because Allbaugh does not  \npresent any intervening change in controlling law, new evidence, or a need to correct a clear \nerror of fact or law. Max’s Seafood Café ex rel. Lou -Ann, Inc. , 176 F.3d at 677 . Allbaugh relies \non nonprecedential decisions and presents no controlling authority  or facts  contradicting the \nCourt’s prior analysis. ( Doc. 22, at 5 -8). Further, Allbaugh’s arguments are restatements of \nhis previous arguments , and m otions for reconsideration should be denied where a movant \nmerely repeats arguments the Court already rejected. Doc. 17 ; Doc. 22, at 5 -8; see Ogden v. \nKeystone Residence , 226 F. Supp. 2d 588, 606 (M.D. Pa. 2002)  (denying a motion for \nreconsideration where the plaintiff repeated arguments already rejected by the court); see \nSmalis v. City of Pittsburgh , No. 2:19 -CV-1609, 2024 WL 2319508, at *2 (W.D. Pa. May 22, \n2024)  (same) ; see also In re Discipline of Elliott J. Schuchardt, PA , No. MC 20 -720, 2020 WL \n6083289, at *1 (W.D. Pa. Oct. 15, 2020)  (same) . \nFinally, Allbaugh’s motion is based on several mischaracterizations of the factual and \nprocedural history of this case. For example, Allbaugh posits that his pro se  status “[m]erits \n[m]itigation” because he “has not ever practiced law in the state of Pennsylvania nor ever \nfiled a pleading with a Pennsylvania court, [and] there was no notice, awareness, or \nknowledge of the requirement to review for rules that cover the use of [generative artificial \nintelligence] .” (Doc. 22, at 6 ). Allbaugh fails to acknowledge that the Court did not just \nsanction him for failing to comply with the Court’s standing order for the use of generative \n \n1 The Court also notes that Allbaugh failed to comply with Local Rule 7.10 ’s requirement \nthat “[a]ny motion for reconsideration . . . must be accompanied by a supporting brief .” \nAllbaugh appears to have combined both his motion and brief into one document. ( Doc. 22 ). Case 3:24-cv-02237-KM-SES     Document 29     Filed 10/31/25     Page 4 of 6 \n5 artificial intelligence  but also for failing to comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 , \nwhich requires parties to verify that they are not submitting briefs that rely on fictitious cases. \n(Doc. 19, at 10 -14). Even though Allbaugh is proceeding pro se , the Court determined that , as \na retired attorney , he should be familiar with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  and Rule \n11’s requirement that parties verify that the cases they cite to exist . (Doc. 19, at 10 -14). \nFurther, contrary to Allbaugh’s argument that the Court failed to consider his pro se  status, \nthe Court mitigate d the sanction  imposed  based on Allbaugh’s pro se  status by imposing  “a \nfine on the lower end of the range of fines imposed by courts for similar offenses.” ( Doc. 19, \nat 14 ). \nAllbaugh also mischaracterizes the current procedural posture of this case by stating \n“there is no foreseeable circumstance where [he] will file further pleadings in this District \nCourt as [he] is not licensed to practice law in the state.” ( Doc. 22, at 7 ). However, on the \nsame day Allbaugh filed his motion for reconsideration, he also  filed an amended complaint,  \nand he clearly intends to continue  litigating  this case and to file briefs when necessary. ( Doc. \n21). Since filing his motion for reconsideration, the University of Scranton filed a motion to \ndismiss, and A llbaugh filed a brief in opposition . (Doc. 23 ; Doc. 2 8). Further, this matter has \nbeen referred to Judge Schwab for the issuance of a nother  report and recommendation, and \nif Judge Schwab recommends the Court grant the  University of Scranton’s  motion  to dismiss , \nAllbaugh will have the opportunity to file an objection under 28 U.S.C.A. § 636 . Allbaugh’s \nnonexistent citation appeared in an objection to a report and recommendation. ( Doc. 14 -1, at \n9-10). Allbaugh could be in the same circumstance s in which he  previously  violated Rule 11, Case 3:24-cv-02237-KM-SES     Document 29     Filed 10/31/25     Page 5 of 6 \n6 the local rules, and the Court’s standing order on the use of generative artificial intelligence .2 \nAccordingly, the Court DENIES  Allbaugh’s  motion. (Doc. 22 ). \nIV. CONCLUSION  \n For the foregoing reasons, Allbaugh’s  motion for reconsideration  is DENIED . (Doc. \n22). \n An appropriate Order follows . \n \n      BY THE COURT:  \nDated: October 31, 2025     s/ Karoline Mehalchick    \n       KAROLINE MEHALCHICK  \n       United States District Judge  \n \n \n2 The Court further notes that Allbaugh cites to unreported cases in his motion for \nreconsideration  but does not provide the Court with copies  of those cases , in accordance with \nLocal Rule 7.8(a) . (Doc. 22 ). The Court previously advised Allbaugh that if he had complied \nwith Local Rule 7.8(a), he would have discovered that he cited to a fictitious unreported case. \n(Doc. 19, at 12 ). Even after being sanctioned, Allbaugh continues to ignore the local rules . Case 3:24-cv-02237-KM-SES     Document 29     Filed 10/31/25     Page 6 of 6",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut dismissed Kasaun Moales's lawsuit against a car dealership due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Moales, proceeding pro se, alleged that his credit application to the dealership was turned into a securitized asset. The court found no federal question jurisdiction as Moales’s claims were based on state law and failed to demonstrate federal diversity jurisdiction, as he did not sufficiently establish an amount in controversy over $75,000. The opinion also noted potential misuse of AI in generating legal arguments, leading to inaccurate legal citations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the claims presented by Moales, considering both federal question and diversity jurisdiction.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because Moales's claims did not arise under federal law, and he failed to meet the requirements for diversity jurisdiction. Consequently, the case was dismissed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A person named Kasaun thought a car dealership did something wrong with his credit application and wanted to sue them in federal court. But the court said they couldn't hear his case because the rules for doing so weren't met, as the case was about regular state laws and not big national ones. Plus, he didn’t show his case involved enough money for the court to handle it. The judge also suspected he might have used a computer program to help with his legal papers that made up some parts of the law, which isn’t allowed because it has to be real.",

OLIVER, United States  District  Judge:  \nPlaintiff Kasaun Moales has filed a pro se  and in forma pauperis complaint against a \ncar dealership and ten unnamed individual defendants. Moales alleges that a credit application \nhe submitted to the dealership was a “source of value” that “created [a] credit contract.”1 He \ncontends that the dealership “may have assigned, transferred, or securitized the contract” for \ncompensation.2 More specifically, he claims that the dealership “monetized, assigned, or \npooled” this “credit contract” “into a securitized trust.”3 He avers  that, as a result, “[t]he debt \nobligation is removed from the original creditor’s balance sheet.”4 He seeks compensatory and \npunitive damages, declaratory relief, a “court -supervised accounting of all financial \n \n1 Compl., ECF No. 1, at 1 , 6. \n2 Id. at  6. \n3 Id.  \n4 Id. at 3.  Case 3:25-cv-00544-VDO     Document 13     Filed 04/30/25     Page 1 of 82 transactions related to the contract,” and “ [a]n injunction stopping [ d]efendant from further \nfinancial transactions until accounting is provided.”5 \nUpon initial review of the Complaint, the Court issued an Order to Show Cause, \nexpressing concern that  it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over t his action  and offering \nMoales the opportunity to file a reply .6 Moales filed such a response.7 For the reasons \nexplained herein, however, the Court concludes that Moales  fails to demonstrate federal \njurisdiction and that the Complaint must be dismissed. See Mitskovski v. Buffalo & Fort Erie \nPub. Bridge Auth., 435 F.3d 127, 133 (2d Cir. 2006)  (“[A] court must satisfy itself that it has \nsubject matter jurisdiction and may at any time in the course of litigation consider whether \nsuch jurisdiction exists. ”). \nIn its Order to Show Cause, the  Court explained that federal question jurisdiction over \nthis action appeared lacking because none of the four claims that Moales brought —Declaratory \nRelief under the Declaratory Judgment Act, “Demand for Accounting,” injunctive relief, and \nfraudulent concealment —constituted a claim arising under federal law.8 In general, federal \ncourts have so- called “federal question” jurisdiction over any claims that arise under federal \nlaw. 28 U.S.C. § 1331. But f ederal question jurisdiction exists only if the complaint pleads a \ncause of action created by federal law or otherwise turns on a substantial question of federal \n \n5 Id. at 4.  \n6 Ord. to Show Cause, ECF No. 8. The Court also expressed its concern that the District of \nConnecticut was the wrong venue for this action. The Court maintains these concerns, but because \nthe Court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the action, the Court need not \naddress this question.  \n7 Response, ECF No. 11 -1.  \n8 Ord. to Show Cause. Case 3:25-cv-00544-VDO     Document 13     Filed 04/30/25     Page 2 of 83 law. See, e.g., New York ex rel. Jacobson v. Wells Fargo Nat ’l Bank, N.A., 824 F.3d 308, 315 \n(2d Cir. 2016) .  \nNone of Moales’s four claims satisfy these requirements. Moales  presents several \narguments to the contrary. First, Moales claims that the Complaint raises issues related to \nfederal regulations and constitutional issues.9 Though it is true that Moales repeatedly \nreferences federal regulations in his C omplaint, none of these references to federal law are \ncritical to the resolution of any of his four claims. Therefore, there is no evidence that the \nresolution of any claim in this action turn s on a substantial question of federal law.   \nSecond, Moales contends that his claims for an accounting and fraudulent concealment \n“implicate constructive trust principles” that are “federalized” and , therefore, that his claims \n“arise from a federally cognizable injury.”10 It is not immediately clear what it means for a \nclaim to be “federalized,” but, as the Court explained in its Order to Show Cause, a fraudulent concealment claim is undoubtedly a state -law tort claim, and a demand for accounting, at least \nin this case, is  a request for a remedy and does not supply an independent cause of action, let \nalone a cause of action sufficient to confer federal question jurisdiction.  A constructive trust, \ntoo, is a remedy, not a cause of action, and a creature of state law.   \nThird, Moales argues  that the Declaratory Judgment Act confers federal question \njurisdiction. But, as explained in the Order to Show Cause, it is well -settled that a complaint ’s \ninvocation of the Declaratory Judgment Act is not , on its own, enough to support federal \nquestion jurisdiction. Correspondent Servs. Corp. v. First Equities Corp. of Fla., 442 F.3d 767, \n \n9 Response at 1. \n10 Id. Case 3:25-cv-00544-VDO     Document 13     Filed 04/30/25     Page 3 of 84 769 (2d Cir. 2006)  (per curiam). To the extent Moales claims  that the legal question underlying \nhis request for a declaratory judgment turns on federal law, the Court disagrees: It appears that \nMoales seeks a declaratory judgment holding that the dealership violated a contract with \nMoales. As best the Court can dis cern, this is a run -of-the-mill state law contract claim that \ndoes not turn on a question of federal law. This argument fails to support the conclusion that \nthe Court has jurisdiction over this action.  \nFourth, Moales claims that he can bring his case under  a federal common law of \nsecurities.11 First, no such federal common law exists: Instead, a series of federal statutes \ngovern s securities law . See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 77a et seq.; see also Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 \nU.S. 64, 78 (1938)  (“There is no federal general common law.” ); 1 Thomas Lee Hazen,  \nTreatise on the Law of Securities Regulation § 1:4 (8th ed. 2020) ( “t[T]here is no federal \n‘common law ’ of securities, and any rights or liabilities must find their source in the statutes \nthemselves.”). Accordingly, the Court concludes that this argument , too, fails to support \nfederal question jurisdiction.  \nAdditionally, Moales claims that the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction is proper \npursuant to federal  diversity jurisdiction.12 Diversity jurisdiction has two requirements: (1) \ncomplete diversity of citizenship amongst the parties and (2) an amount in controversy over \n$75,000. 28 U.S.C. §  1332. Moales  plausibly  alleges complete diversity of citizenship  but he \ndoes not show that this action meets the amount -in-controversy requirement. This \njurisdictional threshold amount is ordinarily established by the face of the complaint , and the \n \n11 Response at 2.  \n12 Response at 2.  Case 3:25-cv-00544-VDO     Document 13     Filed 04/30/25     Page 4 of 85 dollar  amount claimed  therein . See Horton v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 367 U.S. 348, 353 (1961) . \nBut amount -in-controversy allegations are also governed by the plausibility pleading \nrequirement established in Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) , and Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) . See Lapaglia v. Transamerica Cas. Ins. Co., 155 F. Supp. \n3d 153, 155 (D. Conn. 2016) . That means that a plaintiff must do more than merely assert facts \nthat might support the conclusion that the amount -in-controversy requirement is me t: Instead, \na plaintiff should allege facts “sufficient to allow for a plausible inference that the amount in \ncontroversy meets the jurisdictional threshold.” Id.  at 156.  \nMoales’s Complaint contains only conclusory assertions: It merely repeats the basis on \nwhich he seeks damages and asserts that these claims, if aggregated , “easily” meet the amount \nin controversy requirement.13 The Court is not convinced. Moales provides no benchmark or \nother basis for concluding that the contract he alleges existed with the dealership was of such \na value that his damages might exceed $75,000. Absent a specific, plausible, and non-\nconclusory explanation of the basis for his conclusion that his damages exceed $75,000, the \nCourt concludes that the amount -in-controversy requirement is not met in  this action, and thus  \nthat the Court cannot exercise diversity jurisdiction over this action.14 \nBecause the Court cannot exercise either federal question or diversity jurisdiction over \nthis action , the Court lacks subject matter jurisdictio n. Therefore,  the action  is dismissed \n \n13 Response at 2.  \n14 To the extent that the C omplaint can be read as seeking an injunction precluding the dealership \nfrom conducting any business whatsoever, Moales does not show standing to bring this claim, nor \ndoes he identify a cause of action under which he might pursue such relief. As a result, the Court \ndeclines to construe the Complaint to raise this claim, and instead construes the Complaint only to \nseek an injunction preventing the dealership from conducting further business with Moales.  Case 3:25-cv-00544-VDO     Document 13     Filed 04/30/25     Page 5 of 86 pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(h)(3)  and the Clerk of the Court is respectfully \nrequested to close the action . On or before  May 28, 2025, Moales may file an amended \ncomplaint  addressing the issues that led to this dismissal . If Moales has no grounds to seek \nrelief in federal court, he may wish to seek such relief in a state court of proper jurisdiction \nand venue.  \nThe Court , therefore , denies  as moot  the pending motion for leave to proceed in forma \npauperis.15 If Moales wishes to file  an amended complaint, however, Moales is directed to  file \na completed version of the District of Connecticut ’s in forma pauperis form, which is availab le \nat https://www.ctd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/forms/Non- Prisoner- IFP-form -Rev-12-15-\n23.pdf. If Moales fails to either pay the filing fee or submit an acceptable  in forma \npauperis form by  May 28, 2025, this action will remain closed even if Moales files an \namended complaint sufficient to overcome the concerns stated in this Order and the Order to \nShow Cause.  \nLastly, the Court must raise an additional issue sua sponte . Filing a document with the \nCourt is a representation of the truthfulness of the claims contained therein . The obligation to \npresent only contentions with a legitimate basis in fact extends to legal arguments.  \nIn reviewing Moales ’s Response and Complaint, the Court noticed several instances in \nwhich a case did not match the proposition for which it wa s cited. As just one example among \nmany , Moales cites Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185 (1976), and S.E.C. v. W.J. \nHowey Co. , 328 U.S. 293 (1946), for the proposition that a federal common law of fiduciary \n \n15 ECF No. 2.  Case 3:25-cv-00544-VDO     Document 13     Filed 04/30/25     Page 6 of 87 duties supports a common- law private  right of  action .16 Hochfelder  and Howey are, of course, \nseminal securities law cases, but  neither remotely stands for this  proposition: Instead, each  \naddresses  federal statutory  securities laws . This type of clear misstatement of the law is , \nunfortunately , the norm rather than the exception for Moales’s citations to legal authori ty. \nArtificial intelligence is “ known to result in . . . fictional or hallucinatory \ncitations [.]” Strong v. Rushmore Loan Mgmt. Servs., LLC , No. 24-CV-352, 2025 WL 100904, \nat *6 (D. Neb. Jan. 15, 2025) (quotations omitted);  see also Mata v. Avianca, Inc. , 678 F. Supp. \n3d 443 (S.D.N.Y. 2023). For that reason, the Court believes that Moales may have used \nartificial intelligence in drafting his submissions.17  \nArtificial intelligence may  ultimately  prove a helpful tool to assist pro se  litigants in \nbringing meritorious cases to the courts . In that way, artificial intelligence has the potential to \ncontribute to the cause of justice.  However, access ing any beneficial use of artificial \nintelligence requires carefully understanding  its limitations. For example, if merely asked to \nwrite an opposition to a n opposing party’s motion or brief,  or to respond to a court order, an \nartificial intelligence program is likely  to generate such a response , regardless of whether the \nresponse actually has a n arguable  basis in the law . Where the court or opposing party was \ncorrect on the law, the program will very likely generate a response or brief that include s a \nfalse statement of the law . And because artificial intelligence synthesizes many sources with \nvarying degrees of trustworthiness, reliance on artificial intelligence without independent \n \n16 Response at 2.  \n17 That a Court is unable to discern from the face of a filing whether it was written by artificial \nintelligence is the case except in uncommon situations in which  a court is presented with  obvious \nevidence  of artificial intelligence.  Case 3:25-cv-00544-VDO     Document 13     Filed 04/30/25     Page 7 of 88 verification renders litigants unable to represent to the Court that the information in their filings \nis truthful .  \nWhether the issues with Moales’s  filings are the result of artificial intelligence or some \nother mistake, the Court  cautions  Moales  to ensure that future submissions contain only \naccurate representations.  \nSO ORDERED.  \n \nHartford , Connecticut  \nApril 30, 2025  \n/s/Vernon D.

The allegations lacked an arguable legal or factual basis, and there was no possibility that amending the complaint would be fruitful.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone tells a wild story about being wronged by a range of different groups, including some that sound make-believe, like artificial intelligence and witchcraft. They take this story to court, hoping the court will side with them. However, the court looked at the story and said, \"This is too far-fetched and doesn't have the details we need to take it seriously,\" so they decided not to let the case proceed. This is similar to what happened with Mr. Olivier's complaint.",

For the reasons stated be low, this action is dismissed. \nI. BACKGROUND  Mr. Olivier filed a 70-page pleading that  was entered on the docket as Plaintiff’s \nComplaint. [Doc. No. 1].  In the section of the Complaint for jurisdiction, Mr. Olivier states that \nthis “civil action is authorized by 42 U.S. C. section 1983, 1985(e) and 1986, to redress the \ndeprivations, under color of state law, rights s ecured by the constitution of the United States.”  \n[Id. a17].  Mr. Olivier states th at he is “a prisoner of war and a prisoner of the State of \nMassachusetts in custody of th e Massachusetts Department of Corrections [and] is currently \nconfined in the Souza Baranowski Correctiona l Center and also been going through these \nviolations of his rights in MCI Norfolk, NCCI Gardne r, and MCI Concord.”  [ Id. at 18].   The Case 1:24-cv-12093-MJJ     Document 3     Filed 12/31/24     Page 1 of 4 \n2 \n Defendants are identified as Miliary Intelligence,  Artificial Intelligence, Central Intelligence \nAgency, Foreign Intelligence, U.S. Government, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Witch Craft, \nIlluminati, Deep Underground Military, the Department of Corrections and the Souza \nBaranowski Correction Center.  [ Id. at 18 - 21].   Mr. Olivier stat es that the “majority of [his] \nclaims arise from until L-1” and th at the purpose of this unit “is to give the behavioral inmates an \n[opportunity to adju st] to the rules an d regulations.”  [ Id. at 22].   \n Mr. Olivier’s Complaint is di vided into nineteen \"counts\" as follows:  Count 1 (brain \nhacked, brain raped illegally); Count 2 (governme nt misconducts); Count 3 (the original rules \nand regulations the U.S. government, federal governm ent, state government sa id to [Plaintiff] as \nan agreement together at firs t); Count 4 (DOC’s carelessness,  recklessness end agreement and \nother negligence); Count 5 (violations of [Plaintiff’s] acts and claims); Count 6 (policies and \nprocedure and custom 103 CMR 478); Count 7 (l ost, destroyed or with held civil complaint \nlawsuit protocol); Count 8 (campaign of harass ment & abuse); Count 9 (misuse of L-1 unit and \nall of the other units on the North-side of the pr ison); Count 10 (conspiracy); Count 11 (totality \nof the conditions); Count 12 (decl aratory judgment or decree): C ount 13 (violations by artificial \nintelligence act); Count 14 (government malpra ctices-others); Count 15 (other companies \ninvolved); Count 16 (‘hearing voices’ from th e ‘governments’); C ounty 17 (in-summary \njudgments of protection and advocacy for indi viduals with mental illness act); Count 18 \n(congress reports); Count 19 (exhaus tion of legal remedies).   [ Id. at 26-55]. \nFor relief, Plaintiff seeks mone tary damages as well as decl aratory and injunctive relief. \n[Id. at 58 - 63].  \n  Case 1:24-cv-12093-MJJ     Document 3     Filed 12/31/24     Page 2 of 4 \n3 \n II. SCREENING OF THE COMPLAINT \nPlaintiff’s Complaint is s ubject to screening under 28 U. S.C. § 1915A, which requires \nfederal courts to screen prisoner complaints seek ing relief against a gover nmental entity, officer, \nor employee.  28 U.S.C. § 1915A(a).   The Court must dismiss a co mplaint or a por tion thereof if \nthe prisoner has raised claims that  (1) are legally frivol ous or malicious; (2) fail to state a claim \non which relief can be granted; or (3) seek monetary relief from a defendant who is immune \nfrom such relief.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b).   \nAdditionally, the federal courts possess certain  “‘inherent powers,’ not conferred by rule \nor statute, ‘to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orde rly and expeditious disposition of \ncases.’”  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Haeger , 581 U.S. 101, 107 (2017) (quoting Link v. \nWabash R.R. Co. , 370 U.S. 626, 630-31 (1962)).  Those pow ers include the power to dismiss \nfrivolous or malicious actions.  See Mallard v. United States Dist. Ct ., 490 U.S. 296, 307-308 \n(1989); Brockton Sav. Bank. v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. , 771 F.2d 5, 11 n.5 (1st Cir. \n1985).  As used in this context, “frivolous” does not  refer to the subjective in tent of a plaintiff.  \nAxcella Building Realty Trust v. Thompson , No. 23-40151-DHH, 2024 WL 474539, at n. 2 (D. \nMass. Jan. 25, 2024).  “Rather, in legal parlance,  a complaint is ‘frivo lous’ if it ‘lacks an \narguable basis either in law or in fact.’”  Id. (quoting Neitzke v. Williams , 490 U.S. 319, 325 \n(1989)).   \nAlthough the Court liberally construes Mr. Oliv ier’s Complaint becaus e he is proceeding \npro se , see Haines v. Kerner , 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972), it is  subject to dismissal. \nIII. Discussion  Reading the Complaint generously, the Court finds that it lacks an arguable basis in law \nand fact.  In the Complaint, Mr. Olivie r complains that vari ous government and non-Case 1:24-cv-12093-MJJ     Document 3     Filed 12/31/24     Page 3 of 4 \n4 \n governmental entities have violat ed his rights, and that they conspired to do so. The factual \nallegations are conclusory and st ated without any specificity and many of the allegations lack an \narguable basis in fact.  The allegations concerni ng the conditions of confinement in the L-1 Unit \nfail to state a claim upon wh ich relief may be granted. \n In light of the nature of the claims asse rted, the Court finds that amendment would be \nfutile.  Garayalde-Rijos v. Mun. of Carolina , 747 F.3d 15, 23 (1st Cir. 2014) (explaining that sua \nsponte  dismissal is appropriate only when it is crystal clear that the plaintiff cannot prevail and \nthat amending the compla int would be  futile). \nIV. Conclusion \nIn accordance with the foregoing, this acti on is DISMISSED pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1915A and this Court’s inherent authority. SO ORDERED.     \n        /s/ Myong J. Joun  \nMyong J.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The court case involves the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) suing the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) to comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The court determined NSCAI must adhere to both FOIA and FACA, ensuring transparency in its operations, including meeting notifications and public access to records. The case highlights AI and automation's involvement, as NSCAI oversees advancements in AI for national security.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence qualifies as an \"advisory committee\" subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) and an \"agency\" under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court ruled that NSCAI is both an advisory committee, making it subject to FACA, and an agency under FOIA requirements, compelling it to adhere to transparency obligations, including publishing meeting notices and making records publicly accessible.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Think of NSCAI as a government friend group advising on AI technology for national security. EPIC wanted them to stay open about their meetings, like posting events for public viewing. The court agreed, saying the group must follow rules to share what's discussed and decided, just like when a school club must announce meetings and post minutes so everyone knows what’s happening.",

One looks  backward, toward the past ; the \nother looks  forward, toward the future.  Mythologists understand his two- faced depiction as \ncomplementary, not contradictory.1  It means  that every beginning has an ending, every ending a \nbeginning.  Like a  doorway , Janus  looks both ways. \nSo, too, with our Nation’s open government laws.  In general, the Freedom of \nInformation Act (“FOIA”)  is backward  looking, requir ing agencies to disclose historical \ndocuments kept by the agency upon request from a private party .  Under the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (“FACA”) , certain federal advisory bodies are subject to forward -looking \npublication requirements, such as giving  notice of their meetings, open ing them to the public, \nand proactively mak ing their  records publicly available.  But can the same body  be subject to \nboth laws?  \n                                                 \n1  Donald L. Wasson, Janus , Ancient History Encyclopedia (Feb. 6, 2015), \nhttps://www.ancient.eu/Janus/. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 1 of 362 The Court previously held that the National Security Commission  on Artificial \nIntelligence is an agency subject to  FOIA .  EPIC  v. Nat’l Sec. Comm’n on Artificial Intelligence  \n(“NSCAI ”), 419 F. Supp. 3d 82, 83 (D.D.C. 2019) .   Given  that holding, the Commission now \nargues that it cannot possibly also be subject to FACA’s forward- looking disclosure obligations.  \nToday, the Court holds that, like Janus, the Commission does  indeed have two faces, and that \nCongress obligated it to comply with FACA as well as FOIA.   \nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center (“EPIC”)  sued to enforce the Commission’s  \nobligations under both F OIA and FACA.  The Court denied  the Government’s motion to dismiss  \nthe FOIA claims .  Id.  The Government now moves to dismiss EPIC’s FACA claims and its \nrelated claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) .  EPIC moves for summary \njudgment on these counts.  While the Court will dismiss the APA claims for lack of  jurisdiction, \nit will grant summary judgment for EPIC on its FACA claims.         \nI. \n The Court’s previous opinion provides background on the Commission and EPIC’s suit .  \nSee NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 83–85.  A quick refresher is in order.  \nTwo years ago, Congress “established in the executive branch an independent \nCommission to review advances in artificial intelligence, related machine learning developments, \nand associated technologies. ”  John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal \nYear 2019 (“2019 NDAA”), Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051(a)(1), 132 Stat. 1636, 1962 (2018).  \nThe Commission is “ a temporary organization” under 5 U.S.C. § 3161.  Id.  § 1051(a)(2).  Its 15 \nmembers are “appointed for the life of the Commission” and are “F ederal employees.”  Id.  \n§ 1051(a) (4)(A), (6)–(7).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 2 of 363 Congress instructed the Commission to “consider the methods and means necessary to \nadvance the development of artificial intelligence  . . . to comprehensively address the national \nsecurity and defens e needs of the United States.”  Id.  § 1051(b)(1).  The Commission must report \nits findings and recommendations to the President and Congress.  Id.  § 1051(c)(1).  \nThe Commission was originally set to end  this October , but Congress recently extended \nits life by a year .  See National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (“2020 NDAA”), \nPub. L. No. 116- 92, § 1735(a), 133 Stat. 1198, 1819 (2019).  Its next interim report is due by this \nDecember and a final report  is due next March .  Id. § 1735(c)(2) –(3).  \nFrom its inception , the Commission “ has operated almost entirely in secret.”  Compl. \n¶ 59, ECF No. 1.  It has held several meetings  “behind closed doors” and “has failed to publish \nor disclose any notices, agendas , minutes, or materials for those meetings.”  Id.  ¶¶ 38, 59.  \nLast September, EPIC sent a request to the Commission, invoking FOIA and section 10 \nof FACA, 5 U.S.C. app. 2.  Pl.’s Mot. Exs. at 31,2 ECF No. 31- 4.  Under FACA, i t sought \n“[c]ontemporaneous access to, and advance Federal Register notice of, all meetings” of the \nCommission “and any subcomponent thereof.”  Id.  (citing 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(a)).  It also asked \nfor “[c] opies of all ‘records, reports, transcripts, minutes, appendixes, working papers, drafts, \nstudies, agenda[s], or other documents which were made available to or prepared for or by’ ” the \nCommission “and/or any subcomponent thereof.”  Id.  (quoting 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(b)).  The \nCommission acknowledged the request but  did not otherwise respond.  Id. at 34.    \nTwo weeks later, EPIC sued.  It brought claims under FACA (Counts I and IV), the APA \n(Count s II, III, and V), and FOIA (Counts VI, VII, and VIII).  Compl. ¶¶ 112–63.  It \nsimultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction on its FOIA claims.  Mot. for Prelim.

Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 3 of 364 1, ECF No. 4.  The Court denied the motion, finding that EPIC had failed to show irreparable \nharm.  Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 46 –47, ECF No. 22. \nThe Governm ent then moved to dismiss EPIC’s FOIA claims, mainly  arguing that the \nCommission is not an “agency” subject to FOIA, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(f) (1).  The Court rejected \nthat argument.  NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 83.  The Commission has since begun producing \nrecor ds under FOIA .  Joint Status Report at 2, ECF No. 34.   \nThe Government now moves  to dismiss EPIC’s FACA and APA claims .  Defs. ’ Mot. at \n1, ECF No. 28.  These claims are linked, since  the APA claims hinge on alleged violations of \nFAC A.  Count s II and III assert that the Commission’s failure to  give notice of its meetings and \nto open them  to the public , see 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(a) , violates the APA.  Compl. ¶ ¶ 122, 129.  \nCount V claims that the Commission’s failure to make its records publicly available , see 5 \nU.S.C. app. 2 § 10(b) , likewise violates the APA .  Compl. ¶  142.  All three counts seek \ninjunctive relief under the APA.  Id.  ¶¶ 125, 133, 145. \nIn Counts I and IV, EPIC invokes FACA and the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361.  \nLike the APA claims, these counts focus on two sets of alleged FACA violations:  (1) the \nCommission’s  failure to give notice of its meetings and to open them to the public; and (2) the \nCommission’s failure to make its records publicly available.  Id.  ¶¶ 115, 136.  EPIC seeks writs \nof mandamus compelling the Commission to comply with FACA .  Id. ¶¶ 118, 139. \nEPIC responds to the Government’s motion by m oving for summary judgment on the \nFACA and APA claims .  Pl.’s Mot. at 1, ECF No. 31.  Both motions are ripe for disposition.       \nII. \nThe Government’s motion to dismiss invokes Federal Rules  of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) \nand 12(b)(6).  Defs.’  Mot. at 1.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, a plaintiff must establish the Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 4 of 365 Court’s jurisdiction over its claims.  See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 561 (1992).  \nThe Court must  “assume the tr uth of all material factual allegations in the complaint and \nconstrue the complaint liberally, granting plaintiff the benefit of all inferences that can be \nderived from the facts alleged.”  Am. Nat’l Ins. Co. v. FDIC , 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. \n2011) ( cleaned up).  \nTo defeat a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint must “state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on its face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009).  The Court must  “treat the \ncomplaint’s factual allegations as true and must grant the pla intiff[] the benefit of all inferences \nthat can be derived from the facts alleged.”  L. Xia v. Tillerson , 865 F.3d 643, 649 (D.C. Cir. \n2017) (cleaned up).  But the Court need not credit legal conclusions couched as factual \nallegations.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678. \nSummary judgment for EPIC is appropriate if it shows that “ there is no genuine dispute \nas to any material fact and [it]  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \nA fact is “material” if it “might affect the outcome of the s uit under the governing law” and a \ndispute is “genuine” if “the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the \nnonmoving party.”  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986).  The Court must  \nview the evidence “in the light most favorable to the non- moving party.”  Brubaker v. Metro. \nLife Ins.  Co., 482 F.3d 586, 588 (D.C. Cir. 2007).  \nIII. \nA. \n The heart of the dispute here is whether the Commission is an “advisory committee” \nsubject to FACA.  But before resolving that, the Court must  address some threshold issues. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 5 of 366  To start, the Court will dismiss EPIC’s APA claims for lack of jurisdiction.   “Absent a \nwaiver of sovereign immunity, the Federal Government is immune from suit.”  Loeffler v. Frank , \n486 U.S. 549, 554 (1988) .  The APA waives  sovereign immunity when a party seeks relief \nagainst an “agency ,” as defined in 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(1) .  See  5 U.S.C. § 702; Trudeau v. FTC , \n456 F.3d 178, 187 & n.13 (D.C. Cir. 2006) .  If an entity is not an “ agency” under § 701(b)(1), the \nwaiver does not apply and the Court lacks jurisdiction over any APA claims against that entity.  \nTrudeau, 456 F.3d at 187  & n.13;  see FDIC v. Meyer , 510 U.S. 471, 475 (1994) (“Sovereign \nimmunity is jurisdictional in nature.”) .  So the Court must  first determine  whether  the \nCommission is an “agency” under § 701(b)(1).   See  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t , 523 \nU.S. 83, 98 (1998) (affirming “the necessity of determining jurisdiction before proc eeding to the \nmerits”) . \n Both  parties assume  the Court’s previous opinion answered this question in the \naffirmative.  See Defs. ’ Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Mem.”) at 14 , 16 n.2, ECF \nNo. 28- 1; Pl. ’s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (“ Pl.’s Mem.”)  at 28, ECF No. 31- 1.  But \nthey are mistaken.   The opinion did not hold that the Commission is an “agency” under \n§ 701(b)(1) .  It held only that the Commission is an “agency” for purposes of  FOIA , 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(f)(1).   The APA and FOIA define “agen cy” differently.  The APA defines  an agency as \n“each authority of the Government.”   5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 701(b)(1).  FOIA  incorporates this \ndefinition but also expands it:  “‘agency’ as defined in [5 U.S.C. § 551(1)] includes any \nexecutive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled \ncorporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the \nExecutive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency.”   Id. § 552(f)(1).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 6 of 367 The chronology behind these definitions is key.  Before 1974, “each authority of the \nGovernment” was the sole definition of “agency” for both the APA and FOIA.  Se e id. § 551(1) \n(stating that the APA’s definition of “agency” applies “[f]or the purpose of this subchapter,” \nwhich includes FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552); Energy Research Found. v. Def. Nuclear Facilities Safety \nBd., 917 F.2d 581, 583 (D.C. Cir. 1990) .  During this period, the D.C. Circuit interpreted the \nphrase “each authority of the Government” in § 551(1) to mean “any administrative unit with \nsubstantial independent authority in the exercise of specific functions.”  Soucie v. David , 448 \nF.2d 1067, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1971).3  So for a few years , Soucie  supplied the sole test for “agency” \nstatus under FOIA.   See Energy Research , 917 F.2d at 584. \nThe landscape changed in 1 974, when Congress amended FOIA and expanded its \ndefinition of “agency.”  Pub. L. No. 93- 502, § 3, 88 Stat. 1561, 1564 (1974); Energy Research , \n917 F.2d at 583.  The 1974 amendment is c urrently codified at 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  \nThe definition of “agency”  in § 552(f)(1) applies only “[f]or purposes of this section,”  so \nit is exclusive to FOIA.  5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  Indeed, with the language in § 552(f)(1), \n“Congress sought to encompass entities that might have eluded the APA’s definition in \n§ 551(1).”  Energy Research , 917 F.2d at 583.  The upshot is that if an entity fits one of the \ncategories in § 552(f)(1) —such as “establishment in the executive branch” —it will not \n                                                 \n3  Though Soucie  cited only §  551(1), see 448 F.2d at 1073 n.13, its interpretation applies equally \nto the identical phrase in § 701(b)(1).  See Ralpho v. Bell , 569 F.2d 607, 616 & n.54 (D.C. Cir. \n1977) (citing Soucie , among other authorities, in concluding that the Micronesian Claims \nCommission is an “agency” under §  701(b)(1)); Flaherty v. Ross , 373 F. Supp. 3d 97, 104 & n.2 \n(D.D.C. 2019); see also  Pl.’s Reply at 6 & n.1, ECF No. 35.  This accords with the canon that a \nphrase —here, “authority of the Government” —“is presumed to bear the same meani ng \nthroughout a text.”  Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts  170 (2012).  Thus, under  Soucie , the touchstone of “agency” status under § 701(b)(1) \nis the exercise of “substantial independent authority.”  \n Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 7 of 368 necessarily qualify as an “authority of the Government” under §  551(1) and § 701(b)(1).  See id.  \nat 583–84.  Congress thus allowed for something to be an “agency” under §  552(f)(1) but  not an \n“agency” under §  551(1) or § 701(b)(1).   In other words, because of the 1974 amendment , all \nAPA agencies are FOIA agencies , but not vice -versa.  \nThe Commission is precisely this sort of  FOIA -only agency .  The Court’s previous \nopinion got us halfway to  this conclusion, since it held that the Commission is an “agency” under \n§ 552(f)(1).  Any impression conveyed that the Commission is  also an “agency” under §  551(1) \nand § 701(b)(1)  was dicta . \nEnergy Research  was the template for the Court’s opinion.  It held that the Defense \nNuclear Facilities Safety Board was an “agency” under FOIA  because the Board’s organic \nstatute called it an “establishment in the executive branch ,” one of the categories in §  552(f)(1).  \nId. at 58 2–83.  And there was “nothing to indicate that Congress intended to excuse the Board \nfrom complying with FOIA.”  Id.  at 583.  That was the end of the matter.  For entities that fit into \none of the § 552(f)(1)  categories , Soucie ’s functional test determines agency status only if the \nentity is  in the White House.  See id . at 584 (citing Crooker v. Office of the Pardon Attorney , 614 \nF.2d 825, 828 (2d Cir. 1980) ).  The Board was not in the White House , so the functional test was \nirrelevant to its  status as an “agency” under §  552(f)(1).  See id . at 582–84.   Then in dicta , the \ncourt  opined that the Board exercised  “substantial independent authority” and thus was  also a \nFOIA  “agency” under Soucie ’s functio nal test.  Id.  at 584–85. \nThis Court’s previous opinion followed Energy Research ’s analytical steps .  As with  the \nBoard, Congress made the Commission an “establishment in the executive branch,” one of the \ncategories in §  552(f)(1).  NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 86.  Also like the Board, nothing in the \nCommission’s organic statute suggested that Congress intended to excuse it from FOIA.  Indeed, Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 8 of 369 the opposite was true, since the 2019 NDAA excused a different entity from FOIA but did \nexempt the Commission.  Id. at 86 –87.  And Soucie  did not apply because —again like the \nBoard —the Commission is not in the White House.  Id . at 89.  “The text of § 552(f)(1)” was \ntherefore “dispositive”  of the Commission’s status as a FOIA “ agency. ”  Id. \nThen, relying on the dicta  from Energy Research , the Court suggested  in passing that the \nCommission exercises “substantial independent authorit y” and thus could meet Soucie ’s \nfunctional test , too.  Id.  at 89–90.  Still, the Court made clear that this f unctional test was “not \nrelevant.”  Id. at 90.  So, just as in Energy Research , its application of  the functional test was \ndicta .  And because this discussion relied on the dicta  from Energy Research , this was dicta  \nupon dicta .  \n The Government is thus imprecise  when it asserts as the “law of the case” that the \nCommission is an “agency.”  Defs. ’ Mem. at 16 n.2.  This assertion—without reference to \nspecific statutory provisions —is only  half correct.  Under the law -of-the-case doctrine, “the same  \nissue presented a second time in the same  case should lead to the same  result .”  LaShawn A. v. \nBerry , 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  Dicta  is not part of the law of the case.  Nat’l \nSouvenir Ctr., Inc. v. Historic  Figures, Inc., 728 F.2d 503, 511 (D.C. Cir. 1984). \nBy these standards, the  law of th is case is that the Commission is an “agency” under \n§ 552(f)(1), because that was the dispositive point in the Court’s first  opinion.  But any  dicta —\nincluding that the Commission  also met Soucie ’s functional test —is not the law of th is case.  \nUnlike last time, it is n ow necessary to decide whether  the Commission is an “agency” \nunder § 701(b)(1) —as noted, the Court’s jurisdiction over EPIC’s APA claims turns on this.  The \nGovernment implicitly concedes that the Commiss ion is an agency under §  701(b)(1), since it \nmistake nly reads the Court’s previous opinion as having held this.  See Defs. ’ Mem. at 14, 16 Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 9 of 3610 n.2.  But the Court cannot simply adopt this concession.  “[S]ubject -matter jurisdiction, because \nit involves a court’s power to hear a case, can never be forfeited or waived. ”  United States v. \nCotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630 (2002) .  The Court thus has “ an independent obligation to determine \nwhether subject -matter jurisdiction exists.”  Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006). \nAnd upon closer examination , the Court finds  that the Commission is not an agency \nunder § 551(1) or § 701(b)(1).  The D.C. Circuit’s cases highlight  two factors that are central to \nwhether an entity wields “substantial independent authority ”:  investigative power and authority \nto make final and binding decisions. \nConsider first  Soucie .  The Circuit held that the Office of Science and Technology  \n(“OST”)  was an agency because, beyond advising the President, it had the “independent function \nof evaluating federal programs.”  448 F.2d at 1075.  Critically,  in carrying out this “independent \nfunction,” the OST wielded “portions” of Congress’s own “investigatory power.”  Id. at 1075 & \nn.27.  In describing this power, the court cited McGrain v. Daugherty , 273 U.S. 135 (1927), \nwhich upheld the Senate’s authority to compel testim ony.  Id.  at 180.  \nThe next decision introduced another factor:  whether an entity has “formal decision-\nmaking power.”  Grumman Aircraft Eng’g Corp. v. Reneg. Bd. , 482 F.2d 710, 715 (D.C. Cir. \n1973), rev’d on other grounds , 421 U.S. 168 (1975).  In holding that “Regional Boards”  were \n“agencies” under § 551(1) , the c ourt emphasized that “in many cases” they were  “empowered to \nmake final decisions not even reviewable by the [Renegotiation] Board.”  Id. at 714–15. \n This “authority in law to make decisions” was the “important consideration”  when the  \ncourt held that “initial review groups” (“IRGs”)  were not  “agencies” under §  551(1) .  Wash . \nResearch Project , Inc. v. Dep’t  of Health, Educ . & Welfare , 504 F.2d 238, 246, 248 (D.C. Cir. \n1974).  The National Institute of Mental Health (“NIMH”) used IRGs to review grant Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 10 of 3611 applications , but the authority to make “final and binding” decisions rested with the NIMH, not \nthe IRGs .  Id. at 248 & n.15.  It did not matter that the NIMH “may be greatly influenced” by an \nIRG’s “expert view.”  Id.  at 248.  G iven the functions that IRGs were “empowered by law to \nperform,” they did not wield “substantial independent authority.”  Id.  at 24 7–48. \n Two months after Washington Resear ch Project , Congress enacted the 1974 amendment \nthat expanded FOIA’s definition of “agency.”  See  Pub. L. No. 93- 502, § 3 (codified at 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(f)(1)).  The expanded definition encompasse s entities in “the Executive Office of the \nPresident.”  Id.   But a conference report suggests  that FOIA applies to these entities only if they \nwield  “substantial independent authority” under Soucie .  See NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 88 \n(citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93- 1380, at 15 (1974)).  This conference report has spawned  a series \nof cases analyzing whether units  in the White House exercise “substantial inde pendent \nauthority.”4  These cases  echo the importance of decision- making authori ty.  See, e.g., Rushforth \nv. Council of Econ. Advisers , 762 F.2d 1038, 1042 –43 (D.C. Cir. 1985)  (holding that the Council \non Economic Advisers, which ha s a duty “ to appraise federal programs relative to a particular \nstatutory policy and make recommendations to the President in that regard”  but ha s no authority \nto “issue regulations for procedures based on the appraisals,” i s not an agency  under Soucie ’s \nfunctional test ). \nTo be sure, “much of the focus” in these White House cases  “was on the in dependence \naspect” of “substantial independent authority.”  Dong v. Smithsonian Inst., 125 F.3d 877, 881 \n                                                 \n4  See CR EW v. Office of Admin. , 566 F.3d 219, 220 (D.C. Cir. 2009) ; Armstrong v. Exec. Office \nof the President , 90 F.3d 553, 558 (D.C. Cir. 1996) ; Sweetland v. Walters , 60 F.3d 852, 854 \n(D.C. Cir. 1995) ; Meyer v. Bush , 981 F.2d 1288, 1297 (D.C. Cir. 1993) ; Rushfor th v. Council of \nEcon. Advisers , 762 F.2d 1038, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ; Pac. Legal Found. v. Council on Envtl. \nQuality , 636 F.2d 1259, 1263 (D.C. Cir. 1980) ; Sierra Club v. Andrus , 581 F.2d 895, 901–02 \n(D.C. Cir. 1978) , rev’d on other grounds , 442 U.S. 347 (1979).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 11 of 3612 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  The goal was to identify the White House units closest to the President, for \nimposing FOIA  on them would be “a potentially serious c ongressional intrusion into the conduct \nof the President’s daily operations.”  Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Secret Serv., 726 F.3d 208, 226 \n(D.C. Cir. 2013); see NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 90. \n But o f course, m any entities not  in the White House  are indepen dent of  the President, so \nfor them, the “authority” prong is  the sticking point.  See Dong, 125 F.3d at 881.  On this, Dong \nis particularly instructive.  Statutory delegation of “authority ” is key.  See id . at 882.  And “the \nrequisite type of authority” is the “final and binding” kind.  Id. at 881 (citing Wash . Research \nProject , 504 F.2d at 248 n.15). \nMore, the requirement of “substantial” authority suggests that the entity should be at the \n“center of gravity in the exercise of administrative power.”  Id.  at 882 (quoting Lombardo v. \nHandler , 397 F. Supp. 792, 796 (D.D.C. 1975), aff’d , 546 F.2d 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1976)).  On this \nbasis, the National Academy of Sciences was not an agency “despite the fact that it possessed the \napparent authority  . . . to veto the Environmental Protection Agency’s suspension of auto \nemission standards.”  Id.  (citing Lombar do, 397 F. Supp. at 794). \nApplying these principles, Dong held that the Smithsonian i s not an “agency” under \n§ 551(1) because it “does not make binding rules of general application or determine rights and \nduties through adjudication” and “issues no orders and performs no regulatory functions.”  Id.  \nSo too here.  The Commission’s statutory duties are to carry out a review and to report to \nthe President and Congress on its findings and recommendations.  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, \n§ 1051(b) –(c).  Congress thus did not give the Commission the sort of “final and binding” \ndecision -making authority that the case law contemplates .  See Dong, 125 F.3d at 881; Wash . Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 12 of 3613 Research Project , 504 F.2d at 248 & n.15.  Much less did Congress pl ace the Commission at the \n“center of grav ity in the exercise of administrative power.”  Dong, 125 F.3d at 882. \nTo be sure , the Commission’s “review” e ntails a degree of “investigation .”  It has \nreceived “more than 100 briefings” from agencies and M embers of Congress , covering topics \nlike “the status of the U.S. government’s artificial intelligence strategies .”  Compl. ¶¶ 38, 46, 64, \n68, 70.  But there is no suggestion—either in the statute  or in the record —that the Commission \nhas any subpoena or contempt authority, the sort of powers incident to Congress’s “broad power \nof inquiry.”  Soucie , 448 F.2d at 1075 & n.27; see McGrain , 273 U.S. at  168–69, 180. \nGiven these considerations, the Commis sion does not exercise “substantial independent \nauthority .”  Accord Flaherty v. Ross , 373 F. Supp. 3d 97, 106–10 (D.D.C. 2019) .5  The upshot is \nthat the Commission is an “agency” under § 552(f)(1) but not  an “agency” under § 551(1) or \n§ 701(b)(1) , exactly  the sort of entity Congress intended to capture when it expanded FOIA’s \ndefinition of “agency” in 1974.  See Energy Research , 917 F.2d at 583 (“Through [the] words \n[“establishment in the executive branch”], Congress sought to encompass entities that might \nhave eluded the APA’s definition in § 551(1) [.]”).  But because the Commission is not an \n“agency” under §  701(b)(1), the Court m ust dismiss EPIC’s APA claims (Counts II, III, and V) \nfor lack of jurisdiction.  See Trudeau, 456 F.3d at 187 & n.13.          \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Dicta in Energy Research  supports this conclusion.  Congress authorized the Nuclear Safety \nBoard to “conduct hearings,” “compel testimony,” and “require the production of documents.”  \n917 F.2d at 582.  It thus “ha[d] at its disposal the full panoply of investigative powers commonly \nheld by other agencies of government.”  Id.  at 584.  The Board also had “the additional authority \nto impose reporting requirements on the Secretary of Energy.”  Id. at 585.  The Commission has \nno analogous powe rs.   Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 13 of 3614 B. \n That leaves Counts I and IV ; EPIC labels both as “Violation of the FACA.”  Compl. at \n28, 31.  EPI C “does not assert that it has a cause of action under” FACA.  P l.’s Mem. at 30 n.2; \nsee, e.g., EPIC v. Drone Advisory Comm., 369 F. Supp. 3d 27, 36–38 (D.D.C. 2019)  (concluding \nthat FAC A does not confer a private right of action) .  Instead, it seeks mandamus relief based on \nalleged violations of FACA.  See Compl. ¶¶ 115, 118, 136, 139; Pl.’s Mem. at 28–30, 30 n.2. \n Even  though sovereign immunity bars EPIC’s claims under the APA, this immunity does \nnot bar mandamus relief.  See Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 981 & n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  The \nmandamus statute provides that “district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any action in \nthe nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employ ee of the United States or any agency \nthereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.”  28 U.S.C. § 1361.  It is settled that “ [i]f a \nplaintiff seeks a writ of mandamus to force a public official to perform a duty imposed upon him \nin his official capacity  . . . no separate waiver of sovereign immunity is needed.”  Wash. Legal \nFound. v. U.S. Sentencing Comm’n, 89 F.3d 897, 901 (D.C . Cir. 1996) .6 \n Whether this immunity exception  applies “depends upon whether the Government has a \nduty” to comply with the “open meetings” and “public records” requirements in FACA.  Id. ; see \nCompl. ¶¶ 115, 136 (citing 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(a)(1) –(2), (b)).  So “the question of jurisdiction” \nunder the mandamus statute “merges with the question on the merits.”  Wash. Legal Found., 89 \nF.3d at 902.  And the merits question here is whether the Commission is an “advisory \ncommittee”  under 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 3(2), because if it is, then it must comply with FACA’s \nrequirements.  See 5 U.S.C. app. 2 §§ 4(a), 10.  To this question t he Court now turns.         \n                                                 \n6  The Defendants listed for Counts I and IV are the Commission and two officials —Eric \nSchmidt, its Chairman, and Ylli Bajraktari, its Executive Director.  Compl. at 28, 31. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 14 of 3615 Congress enacted FACA in 1972 to provide a framework for the many boards , councils, \nand commissions that advise the Executive Branch.  See Pub. Citizen v. DOJ , 491 U.S. 440, \n445–46 (1989).  It found that t hese bodies  are “a useful and beneficial means of fur nishing expert \nadvice, ideas, and diverse opinions to the Federal Government.”  5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 2(a).  And it \nsaw a need to keep the public “informed” about the ir “activities. ”  Id. § 2(b)(5).  \nTo that end, FACA calls for open meetings .  A committee’s meetings “ shall be open to \nthe public.”  Id.  § 10(a)(1).  “[T] imely notice” of these meetings “shall be published in the \nFederal Register.”  Id.  § 10(a)(2).   This  transparency extends to records , too.  “S ubject to [5 \nU.S.C. § 552 (FOIA)],” all  documents “ which were made available to or prepared for or by each \nadvisory committee shall be available for public inspection and copying  . . . until the advisory \ncommittee ceases to exist.”  Id.  § 10(b).  Unlike FOIA, this provision looks forward.  It r equires \ncommittees to take affirmative steps to make their records are public, even absent a request.  \nFACA’s definition of “advisory committee” has  four parts.  First , it includes “any \ncommittee, board, commission, council, conference , panel, task force, o r other similar group, or \nany subcommittee or other subgroup thereof.”  Id.  § 3(2).  Second, it must be “established by \nstatute or reorganization plan,” “established or utilized by the President,” or “established or \nutilized by one or more agencies.”  Id.  Third, it must be “established” or “utilized” “in the \ninterest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or \nofficers of the Federal Government.”  Id.   Fourth, the definition  excludes  “any committee that is \ncomposed wholly of full -time, or permanent part -time, officers or employees of the Federal \nGovernment .”  Id.  The Court agrees with EPIC that the Commission meets this definition . \nStart with the text of the 2019 NDAA, the Commission’s organic statute.  Congress \nestablished a “Commission.”  Pub. L. No. 115 -232, § 1051(a)(1).  Its mandate is to “consider the Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 15 of 3616 methods and means necessary to advance the development of artificial intelligence . . . to \ncomprehensively address the national security and defense needs of the United States.”  Id.  \n§ 1051(b)(1).  And it must report “to the President and Congress” its “findings” and \n“recommendations  . . . for ac tion by the executive branch and Congress related to artificial \nintelligence.”   Id. § 1051(c); see also  2020 NDAA, Pub. L. No. 116- 92, § 1735(c ). \nThese words fit the definition of “advisory committee” like a glove.   From a purely \ncommonsens e standpoint, is the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence an \n“advisory” commission?  Of course  it is.  Congress created a “commission.”  5 U .S.C. app. 2 \n§ 3(2).  It is “established by statute” and “utilized by the President.”  Id.   And since it provides \n“findings” and “recommendations” to the President, it is “established” and “utilized” “in the \ninterest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President.”  Id.  \nMore, Congress noticeably declined to exempt the Commission from FACA , even though \nit carved out  FACA exemptions elsewhere in the same law.  The 2019 NDAA creates  the \nCyberspace Solarium Commission but declare s that “[t]he provisions of the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act . . . shall not apply to the activities of [this] Commission.”  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, \n§ 1652(m)(1).  The law also states that “[s]ubsections (a)(1) , (a)(3), and (b) of section 10 and \nsections 11, 13, and 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act  . . . shall not apply” to a body \ncalled “the Emerging Technology and Research Advisory Committee.”  Id. § 1758(f)(5).  \nThe Court likewise found the lack  of an exemption significant in concluding that the \nCommission is subject to FOIA.  See NSCAI , 419 F. Supp. 3d at 86–87.  The 2019 NDAA \nexcuses the Cyberspace Solarium Commission from FOIA, see  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, \n§ 1652(m )(2), but does not excuse the AI Commission from FOIA.  So too for FACA.    Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 16 of 3617 The Government protests  that “no canon of statutory construction provides that the Court \nshould assign weight to [the] absence” of an “explicit exemption.”  Defs.’  Reply at 17, ECF No. \n33.  But here, that is wrong, since Congress elsewhere carved out exemptions.  “Where Congress \nincludes particular language in on e section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same \nAct, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate \ninclusion or exclusion.”  Russello v. United States , 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (cleaned up).  \nThe Government also points to  one example—from  a different law —in which Congress \nmade clear that FACA applies .  Defs. ’ Reply at 17 –18; see Pandemic and All -Hazards \nPreparedness and Advancing Innovation Act  of 2019 (“Pandemic Act”) , Pub. L. No. 116 -22, \n§ 505(d), 133 Stat. 905, 952 (“The Federal Advisory Committee Act  . . . shall apply to the \nactivities and duties of the [Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic -Resistant \nBacteria].”).  Based on this example, the Government contends that “it is at leas t as telling that \nCongress also did not explicitly make the Commission an advisory committee.”  Defs.’ Reply  at \n17.  Not quite.  Congress formed  the Commission using language that tracks FACA’s definition \nof “advisory committee.”  That was enough to “make”  the Commission an advisory committee.  \nIt is a fair point that Congress did not declare in so many words that “FACA shall apply” \nto the Commission.  But a weak one.  T he one example the Government cites was in the \nPandemic Act , not the 2019 NDAA .  The 2019 NDAA itself contains no examples of Congress \nsaying that “FACA shall apply .”  It contains only examples of Congress saying that “FACA shall \nnot apply.”  Yet the NDAA does  not use this language for the Commission.  T his reinforces the \nconclusion that Congress made the Commission an “advisory committee.”  See Russello , 464 \nU.S. at 22–23. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 17 of 3632 A second, independent reason why the Commission does not fall within  this exclusion is \nthat its  members are not “part -time” federal employees .  Instead, they are “intermittent” \nemployees.  EPIC points to a regulation stating that “[a]n intermittent work schedule is \nappropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that a tour of duty \ncannot be regularly scheduled in advance.”  Pl.’s Mem. at 18 (quoting 5 C.F.R. § 340.403(a) ).  \nThis regulation explicitly distinguishes “intermittent” status from “part -time” status, as it says \nthat “[w]hen an agency is able to schedule work in advance  on a regular basis, it has an \nobligation to document the change in work schedule from intermittent to part -time or full- time to \nensure proper service credit.”  5 C.F.R. § 340.403( a). \nThe Court agrees with EPIC that “intermittent” accurately describes the employment \nstatus of the Commission’s members.

This limited and \nirregular work schedule fits the bill as “sporadic and unpredictable. ”  5 C.F.R. § 340.403(a) . \nThe Government does not dispute that § 340.403 is relevant to the meaning of “part -\ntime” versus “intermittent.”  Indeed, it provide s no affirmative argument for why the \nCommission’s members are “part -time.”  See Defs. ’ Mem. at 21 –22; Defs.’ Reply at 1 6–17.11      \n                                                 \n11  EPIC claims the Government’s Answer conceded that “the members of the AI Commission \nare employed on an ‘intermittent’ basis.”  Compl. ¶  43 (quoting 5 C.F.R. § 340.403); see Pl.’s \nMem. at 18.  The Government disagrees.  Defs.’  Reply at 16 –17.  The Court need not resolve \nthis, as  it does not rely on this aspect of EPIC’s argument in concluding that the Commission’s \nmembers are “intermittent”  employees .  The Court also does not  rely on EPIC’s assertion —\nsupported by a declaration attached to its reply brief —that the Commission’s c hief of s taff stated  \nthat “the members of the Commission were employed in ‘excepted service appointments on an \nintermittent basis.’”  Pl.’s Reply at 15; see Davisson Decl. ¶  8, ECF No. 35 -1. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 32 of 3633 One final point:  EPIC ’s position finds support in Associatio n of Am erican  Physicians & \nSurgeons, Inc. v. Clinton (“ AAPS ”), 997 F.2d 898 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  AAPS  considered the status \nthe President’s Task Force on National Health Care Reform and its working group.  Id. at 900.  \nThe court remanded for further proceedings on the status of the working group.  Id.   It was \ncomposed in part of  “40 ‘special government em ployees’ hired by  . . . agencies and the \nExecutive Office of the President for a limited duration .”  Id.  at 901.  \nThe court expressed skepticism that the working group—so composed—fell within \nFACA’s exclusion.  “FACA would be rather easy to avoid if an agency could simply appoint 10 \nprivate citizens as special government employees for two days, and then have the committee \nreceive the section 3(2) exemption as a body composed of full -time government employees.”  Id.  \nat 915.  Similar logic applies here.  FACA “would be rather easy to avoid” if the Government is \nright that private -citizen members of short -term advisory groups  are always “permanent part -\ntime” employees of the Federal Government.  Indeed, AAPS  genera lized that “a formal group of \na limited number of private citizens who are brought together to give publicized advice as a \ngroup . . . would seem covered by [FACA].”  Id.   The Commission fits this model.      \nC. \n Because the Commission is an “advisory committee” that must comply with FACA’s \nrequirements, EPIC’s entitlement to mandamus relief is straightforward.  The party seeking \nmandamus has the burden of showing “(1) a clear and indisputable right to relief, (2) that the \ngovernment agency or official is violating a clear duty to act, and (3) that no adequate alternative \nremedy exists. ”  Am. Hosp. Ass’n v. Burwell , 812 F.3d 183, 189 (D.C. Cir. 2016).12 \n                                                 \n12  “Even when [these three] legal requirements for mandamus jurisdiction have been satisfied, \nhowever, a court may grant relief only when it finds compelling equitable grounds.”   Am. Hosp. \nAss’n , 812 F.3d at 189.  Given the Commission’s clear duty to comply with FACA, the Court Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 33 of 3634  EPIC has shown all three .  Since relief under the APA is unavai lable, see supra  Section \nIII.A, “no adequate alternative remedy exists.”  And  the Government’s sole argument for why \nEPIC has not established “a clear and indisputable right to relief” or “a clear duty to act” is that \nthe Commission is not an “advisory com mittee” under FACA.   Defs. ’ Mem. at 20–24.13  This, of \ncourse, is the argument that the Court has rejected.  See supra Section III.B.  \n The Government’s only  remaining  argument against mandamus is that EPIC did not \n“adequately plead []” claims under the mandamus statute.  Defs. ’ Mem. at 18 –19.  “[I] t is \nimpossible to know ,” the Government complains, “what counts [EPIC] intended to pursue \nunder” this statute “or the specific allegations that would support claims under [it] .”  Id.   The \nCourt disagrees.  \nEPIC  style s its Complaint as one “ for Injunctive, Mandamus, and Declaratory Relief.”  \nCompl. at 1.  It cite s the mandamus statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, in the Complaint’s first paragraph \nand in its jurisdictional statement.  Id.  ¶¶ 1, 7.  Then, in Count I, it cla ims that the Commission’s \n“failure to timely notice and open [its] meetings violates 5 U.S.C. app. 2 §§ 10(a)(1) and (a)(2) \n                                                 \nfinds “compelling equitable grounds” for mandamus  relief .  Indeed, the Government makes no \nargument for why, if the Commission is subject to FACA, there would not be “compelling \nequitable gro unds” for relief .  Other than an argument that EPIC  has an adequate alternative \nremedy in the APA and an argument that EPIC  did not adequately plead mandamus claims, \nwhich the Court addresses infra , the Government’s arguments against mandamus focus \nexclusi vely on its belief that the Commission is just not subject to FACA in the first place.  See \nDefs.’ Mem. at 18 –24; Defs.’ Reply at 18–20, 18 n.6. \n \n13  For the first element of mandamu s, the Government invokes the doctrine of “judicial \nestoppel.”  Defs.’  Mem. at 22 –24.  This doctrine “generally prevents a party from prevailing in \none phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in \nanother phase.”  Pegram v. Herdrich , 530 U.S. 211, 227 n.8 (2000).  The Government c ontends \nthat this doctrine bars mandamus relief because EPIC “prevailed on its earlier position that the \nCommission is an agency subject to FOIA” and “an entity cannot be both an agency and an \nadvisory committee.”  Defs.’ Mem. at 23.  So the Government’s i nvocation of “judicial estoppel” \njust boils down to its argument that the Commission is not an advisory committee.  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 34 of 3635 and constitutes a failure to perform duties owed to EPIC within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1361.”  Id.  ¶ 115.  Count IV likewise ass erts that the Commission’s “failure to make [its] \nrecords available for inspection and copying is a violation of 5 U.S.C. app. 2 § 10(b) and \nconstitutes a failure to perform a duty owed to EPIC within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1361.”  \nId. ¶ 136.  Both counts seek “a writ of mandamus” compelling the Commission and its officers to \ncomply with FACA.  Id.  ¶¶ 118, 139.  These counts ma ke clear that EPIC  seeks mandamus relief \nbased on the Commission’s refusal to comply with FACA.  \nAnd for the reasons explained, EPIC is correct that the Commission is subject to FACA.  \nEPIC is thus entitled to writs of mandamus compelling the Commission and its officers to \nprovide timely notice of its meetings, to open them to the public, and to make its  records \navailable for public inspection and copying .  Id. ¶¶ 115, 118, 136, 139; Compl.

Requested Relief ¶  H.  Under the DJA, the Court “may declare the rights \nand other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.”   28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) .  \nThis statute “is not an independent source of federal jurisdiction” ; rather,  “the availability of \nsuch relief presupposes the existence of a judicially remediable right.”  Schilling v. Rogers , 363 \nU.S. 666, 677 (1960).  The Court independently has jurisdiction here under the mandamus \nstatute, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, and EPIC  has a judicially remediable  right to have the Commission \ncomply with its duties under FACA.  See Wash. Legal Found., 89 F.3d at 901–02; supra Section \nIII.B.  EPIC is thus entitled to a declaration that the Commission has a duty under FACA to \nprovide timely notic e of its meetings, to open them to the public, and to  make its records Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 40   Filed 06/01/20   Page 35 of 3636 available for public inspection and copying .

But \nthe Government’s own authorities show that EPIC was right not to plead it as an independent \ncause of action.  Id.  at 19.  It cites cases stating that the DJA does not itself provide “a cause of \naction,” Al i v. Rumsfeld , 649 F.3d 762, 778 (D.C. Cir. 2011), and that “a count for declaratory \njudgment  . . . is more properly included in the prayer for relief,” Drone Advisory Comm., 369 F. \nSupp. 3d at 38 (cleaned up).

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) suing the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Department of Defense (DOD) for failing to comply with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests made by EPIC. EPIC requested records related to the Commission's activities, which involve reviewing advances in AI and making recommendations to the U.S. government, but both entities were unresponsive. The court determined that the Commission is subject to FOIA and denied the government's motion to dismiss EPIC's claims, highlighting that transparency is critical given the significant implications of AI policy on privacy and human rights.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence qualifies as an “agency” subject to FOIA, requiring it to provide requested records to EPIC.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the Commission is indeed an \"agency\" under FOIA, as it is an establishment in the executive branch, and therefore it must comply with EPIC’s FOIA requests. Consequently, the government's motion to dismiss was denied, allowing EPIC's FOIA claims to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: EPIC asked the government for documents about an AI commission's work, because they believe this work can highly influence how AI is used by the government. The government said they're not the type of organization that needs to share this information under the law. The court disagreed, saying the commission does need to share the information, like other government offices. So now EPIC can move forward in getting the information they need.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  \n \nELECTRONIC PRIVACY INFORMATION \nCENTER , \n \nPlaintiff,    \n \nv.       \n \nNATIONAL SECURITY COMMISSION ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, et al. ,\n    Defendant s. \n         \n  \n   Case No.  1:19- cv-02906 (TNM ) \nMEMORANDUM OPINION  AND ORDER  \n Congress recently created the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence .  \nThe Electronic Privacy Information Center ( “EPIC ”) wants  to shed light on the Commission’s \nwork.  EPIC requested records from the Commission and the Department of Defense under the \nFreedom of Information Act ( “FOIA ”), 5 U.S.C. § 552.  Neither entity was forthcoming with \nrecords, so EPIC sued .  The Government moves to dismiss  some of  EPIC’s  claims.   Its primary \ncontention is that the Commission is not an “agency” subject to FOIA.  The Court finds  \notherwise.  For this and other reasons , the Court denies  the Government’s motion.  \nI. \nCongress gave the Commission its marching orders in the John S. McCain National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (“NDAA”) .  See  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051, \n132 Stat. 1636, 1962–65 (2018).  Its mandate is “ to review advances in artificial intelligence, \nrelated machine learning developments, and associated technologies.”   Id. § 1051(a) (1).  In \ncarrying out that review, the Commission must consider many  factors, including the country’s \nnational security needs.  See id.  § 1051(b)(1) –(2).  This review is not academic.  The NDAA Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 1 of 232 requires the Commission to submit three reports to the President and Congress .  Id. § 1051(c).  \nThese reports  are to contain the Commission’s findings and any recommendations it has  “for \naction by the executive branch and Congress related to artificial intelligence . . . including \nrecommendations to more effectively organize the Federal Government.”  Id. § 1051(c )(1).  The \nreports “shall be made publicly available, but may include a classified annex.”  Id.  § 1051(c )(3). \n  The Commission was to submit an initial report within 180 days of its creation , id. \n§ 1051(c)(1 ), and an interim report was due in August 2019.  Id.  § 1051(c)(2).  Both reports \ncame late.   Compl. ¶¶ 75, 79, ECF No. 1.  The Commission will end  in October 2020.  Pub. L. \nNo. 115- 232, § 1051(e).1  Before then , the Commission must submit one final report to the \nPresident and Congress.  See id. § 1051(c)(2).  \nThe Commission consists of 15 members.  Id.  § 1051(a)(4)(A).  Most are congressional \nappointees.  The Secretary of Defense appoints two members and the Secretary of Commerce appoints one .  Id. § 1051(a)(4)(A)(i)–(ii).  But the  chairman or ranking m ember of six \ncongressional committees appoint the others .  Id. § 1051(a)(4)(A)(iii)–(xiv).   \nEPIC describes itself as “one of the leading organizations in the country with respect to \nthe privacy and human rights implications of AI use .”  Compl. ¶  10.  So it comes as little surprise \nthat EPIC has closely tracked the Commission .  Or at least it tries  to do so.  EPIC alleges that the \nCommission “has operated almost entirely in secret.”  Id.  ¶ 59.  When EPIC filed its Complaint, \nthe Commission had held at least 13 meetings  and had received “more than 100 briefings.”  Id.  \n¶ 38.  But the Commission ha d conducted these proceedings “behind closed doors ” and had \n“failed to publish or discl ose any notices, agendas, minutes, or materials for those meetings.”  Id.  \n                                                 \n1  The  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2020, not yet enacted, would extend the life of the Commission  \nthrough March 2021.  See  S. 1790, 116th Cong. § 1083 (2019).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 2 of 233 ¶ 59.  Meanwhile, the Commission is now working to prepare its final recommendations.   See \nCompl. Ex. H .  These recommendations, EPIC claims, “could have far -reaching i mplications fo r \nthe U.S. government, private companies, and the public at large.”  Compl. ¶ 5. \nEPIC has tried to  shine light on the  Commission .  In February, EPIC asked DOD for \nrecords related to the Commission’s work, invoking both FOIA and the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (“FACA”), 5 U.S.C. app. 2.  Compl. Ex. B at 1, 6.2  EPIC requested  expedited \nprocessing under FOIA .  Id. at 4–5; see 5 U.S.C. §  552(a)(6)(E).   EPIC gave two reasons why it s \nrequest was urgent .  Compl. Ex. B at 4.  First, the release of the Commission’s initial report was \nimminent.   Id.  Second, the Commission was “operating at a time when the White House ha s \nlaunched the ‘American AI Initiative.’”  Id.  So the Commission’s “findings , recommendations, \nand proceedings” would “have significant influence on AI policymaking by both Congress and the executive branch.”  Id. \nDOD acknowledged  EPIC’s FOIA request six days later.  Compl. Ex. C.  Though it had \n“begun processing”  the request, it was unable to respond within FOIA’s 20 -day period because \nof “unusual circumstances.”  Id.   It also denied EPIC’s request for expedited processing because \nEPIC had “not clearly demonstrated how the information will lose its value if not processed on \nan expedited basis.”  Id.   EPIC filed an administrative appeal of DOD’s denial of expedited \nprocessing.  Compl. Ex. E.  DOD had not acted on this appeal when EPIC sued here .  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 109–10. \nIn September, EPIC submitted requests under FOIA and FACA to the Commission itself.  \nCompl. Ex. I at 1, 11.  It aga in requested expedited processing  under FOIA .  Id. at 8–9.  EPIC \n                                                 \n2  The Complaint does not explain why EPIC thought it could get the Commission’s records \nthrough DOD.  The Commission is not part of DOD, though Congress funded the Commission \nwith $10,000,000 that it had appropriated to DOD.  See Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051(a)(2), (d).  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 3 of 234 said it was urgent to inform the public about the Commission’s activities before it released its \ninterim report.  Id.   EPIC also reiterated that the Commission’s findings and recommendations \nwould “have significant influence on the White House’s [AI] initiative and on AI policy generally.”  Id. at 9.  The Commission acknowledged receipt of EPIC’s request s but has not \notherwise responded to them .  Compl. ¶¶ 81, 84, 94–97. \nSixteen days after it submitted its requests  to the Commission, EPIC filed this action.   Id. \n¶ 95.  The Complaint raises three claims under FOIA, two claims under FACA, and three claims \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act.  See id. ¶¶  112–63.  EPIC simu ltaneously moved for a \npreliminary injunction.   Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 1,\n3 ECF No. 4.  It claimed it would suffer \nirreparable harm if the Court did not immediately order the Commission and DOD to process its FOIA requests in an expedited  fashion.  See Me m. in Supp. of Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 9–10, ECF \nNo. 4- 1.  After holding a hearing, the Court denied the motion because EPIC had failed to show \nirreparable harm .  See Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 46 –47, ECF No. 22.  \nThe hearing revealed that the Commission  is more likely than DOD to have the  records \nthat E PIC wants.   See id. at 32.  T he Commission has no other pending FOIA requests or even a \nFOIA apparatus .  Id. at 28, 31.  Indeed, the Government claimed that the Commission is not \nsubject to FOIA.  Id. at 28.  T he Court thus  order ed expedited briefing on t his threshold question.  \nSee id. at 57 –58. \nThat issue is now ripe .  The Government argues that the Court should dismiss EPIC’s \nFOIA claims against the Commission becau se it is not an “agency” subject to FOIA.   See Mot. to \nDismiss FOIA Claims at 1 (“ Partial Mot. to Dismiss”), ECF No. 23.  The Government also \ncontends  that even if the Commission is subject to FOIA, the Court should still dismiss  two \n                                                 \n3  All page citation s are to the page numbers generated by the Court’s CM/ECF system.

See Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss \nFOIA Claims (“Gov’t Mem.”) at 12–13, ECF No. 23- 1.  Count VI asserts a claim under FOIA \nbased on the failure of the Commission and DOD to comply with the statute’s deadlines.   Compl. \n¶¶ 147–52.  Count VII alleges that the Commission and DOD unlawfully denied expedited \nprocessing  of EPIC’s  FOIA requests .  Id. ¶¶ 154– 58.      \nII. \nThe Government’s motion to dismiss invokes Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  \nParti al Mot. to Dismiss at 1 .  To survive this  motion, a complaint must contain sufficient  factual \nallegations that, if true, “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007) .  The Court  must  “treat the complaint’s factual allegations as \ntrue and must grant the plaintiffs the benefit  of all inferences that can be derived from the facts \nalleged.”  L. Xia v. Tillerson, 865 F.3d 643, 649 (D.C. Cir. 2017)  (cleaned up ).  But c ourts need \nnot accept the truth of legal conclusions or “[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of \naction, supported by mere conclusory statements.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) .        \nIII. \nA. \n “By its terms, FOIA applies only to an ‘agency .’”  CREW  v. Office of Admin., 566 F.3d \n219, 222 (D.C. Cir. 2009) ; see 5 U.S.C. § 552(a) (“Each agency shall make available to the \npublic information as follows[.]”).  The Court concludes  that the  Commission is indeed an \n“agency” subject to FOIA.  Consider first the definition of “agency.”  The  general definition is \n“each  authority of the Government of the United States .”  5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  FOIA  specifies  that \n“‘agency’ as defined in section 551(1) of [title 5]  includes any  executive department, military \ndepartment, Government corporation, Government controlled corporati on, or other Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 5 of 236 establishment in the executive branch of the Government  (including the Executive Office of the \nPresident), or any independent regulatory agency .”  Id.  § 552(f)(1) (emphasis added).  \n Now consider  the NDAA, the Commission ’s organic statute .  It decrees : “There is \nestablished in the executive branch an independent Commission to review advances in artificial \nintelligence [.]”  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051(a)(1)  (emphasis added).   That Commission “ shall \nbe considered an independent establishment of the Federal Government as defined by section 104 of title 5 .”  Id.  § 1051(a)(2)  (emphasis added) .  Section 104 of title 5, meanwhile, explains \nthat “[f] or purposes of this title, ‘independent establishment’ means  . . . an establishment in the \nexecutive branch  . . . which is not an Executive department, military department, Government \ncorporation, or part thereof, or part of an independent establishment.”  5 U.S.C. § 104(1) (emphasis added).   Congress could have hardly  been clearer.  Having said that FOIA applie s to \n“any . . . establishment in the executive branch,” id. § 552(f)(1) (emphasis added) , it chose to call \nthe Commission an “establishment in the executive branch.”  \n This has happened before.  Thirty years ago, Congress created the Defense Nuclear \nFacilities Safety Board .  See Energy Research  Found. v . Def. Nuclear Facilities  Safety  Bd., 917 \nF.2d 581, 582 (D.C. Cir. 1990).  The Board’s organic statute  declared : “There is hereby \nestablished an independent  establishment in the executive branch.”   42 U.S.C. § 2286(a).  The \nBoard claimed it was not subject to FOIA, but the D.C. Circuit disagreed.  See Energy Research , \n917 F.2d at 58 1.  The court observed that § 2286(a)  “used the same terms contained in § 552( f)’s \ndescription of ‘agency.’”   Id. at 582.  “It would be a tall piece of statutory construction,” the \ncourt continued, “to say that an ‘establishment in the executive branch’ as used in § 2286(a) is \nnot an ‘establishment in the executive branch’ within the meaning of § 552(f).”  Id. at 582–83.  \nSo too here.  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 6 of 237  There is more.  Energy Research  went beyond just the textual comparison.  It looked at \nthe whole of the Board’s statute and found “nothing to indicate that Congress intended to excuse \nthe Board from complying with FOIA.”   Id. at 583.  T he same is true here.   See Pub. L. No. 115-\n232, § 1051.  Indeed, there is powerful  circumstan tial evidence that Congress intended to impose \nFOIA on the  Commission.  In a different section of the  NDAA, Congress created the Cyberspace \nSolarium Commission.   Id. § 1652.  But it did not establish this c ommission “ in the executive \nbranch” or use a cross -reference to 5 U.S.C. § 104.  Congress said simply “[t]here is established \na commission  . . . known as t he ‘Cyberspace Solarium Commission.’”  Id.  § 1652(a)(1) –(2).  A  \nlater subsection then declared that FOIA “shall not apply to the activities, records, and proceedings of the [Cyberspace Solarium] Commission.”   Id. § 1652(m)(2).  So the C ongress \nthat created  the AI Commission knew how to excuse it from FOIA, but did not do so.   \nThe Government has no direct response to these textual arguments.  See  Reply in Supp. \nof Mot. to Dismiss FOIA Claims (“Gov’t Reply”) at 7 –9, ECF No. 25.  Instead, l ike a stranger \noffering cand y to a child, the Government invites the Court not to read 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1) \nliterally .  See infra Section III.B.  EPIC, meanwhile,  points to several  other “establishment[s] in \nthe executive branch” that do comply with FOIA.  Consider the language Congress used to create \nthese entities,  all of which have websites devoted to FOIA requests .

Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 8 of 239  Of course, an entity is not  subject to FOIA simply because it has a FOIA website .  \nPerhaps these ten bureau cracies  welcomed  the opportunity to open their internal deliberations to \npublic inspection.  But  this list suggests  that excusing the Commission from FOIA would be \nanomalous , to say the least. \nB. \nThe Government  urges  that 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1) does not mean what it says .  By its \nterms, § 552(f)(1) declares  that “any  . . . establishment in the executive branch” is subject to \nFOIA.  But the Government says not so.  See Gov’t Mem. at 15.  T he Government contends  that \nthe caselaw  requires  a non -literal reading.   See id.  at 15–18.  Its argument starts with Soucie v. \nDavid , 448 F.2d 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1971) .  See Gov’t Mem. at 14–15.   \nThe question in Soucie  was whether the Office of Science and Technology, a body in the \nExecutive Office of the President, was subject to FOIA.  448 F.2d at  1070 n.2, 1071.  At the \ntime, the only relevant definition of “agency” was the one in § 551(1) —an “authority of the \nGovernment of the United States.”   See id.  at 1073 .  Congress had not yet enacted § 552(f)(1).  \nSoucie  reasoned  that the definition in § 551(1) “confers agency status on any administrative unit \nwith s ubstantial independent authority.”  Id.   Since  the Office of Science and Technology did not \njust “advise and assist the President,” but also had an “independent functi on of evaluating federal \nprograms,” it was  an “ agency ” under  § 551(1), and thus  subject to FOIA .  See id.  at 1075.  \nThe relevance here of Soucie ’s functional analysis  is not immediately apparent.  The \ndecision came before the enactment of § 552(f)(1).  It thus dealt with the general phrase \n“authority of the Government,” not the  more specific phrase “establishment in the executive \nbranch.”   But, the Government says, the Court should consider the legislative history of the 1974 \namendment  that enacted § 552(f)(1).   See Gov’t Mem. at 15.  R ecall the text of that provision:  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 9 of 2310 “‘agency’ as defined in section 551(1) of this title includes  any . . . establishment in the executive \nbranch of t he Government ( including the Executive Office of the President ).”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(f)(1) (emphasis added).   The conference report  for the 1974 amendment  contain s the \nfollowing language :   \nWith respect to the meaning of the term “ Executive Office of the Pres ident ” the conferees \nintend the result reached in Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (C.A.D.C. 1971).  The term is \nnot to be interpreted as including the President’s immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President.  \n H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93- 1380, at 15 (1974)  (emphasis added).  \nSo the conferees intended to exempt some entities in the White House  from  FOIA, \ndespite what § 552(f)(1) says.  Back in the bacchanalian days of judicial idolization of legislative \nhistory, t he Supreme Court relied on this report  to hold that the telephone notes of  an Assistant to \nthe President were not “agency records” under  FOIA.  See Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for \nFreedom of the Press , 445 U.S. 136, 155–56 (1980) .  The D.C. Circuit joined in, holding that \ncertain  entities in the White House  are not subject to FOIA.  See, e.g. , Rushforth v. Council of \nEcon. Advisers , 762 F.2d 1038, 1040, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1985) .  Cases like Rushforth apply \nSoucie ’s functional analysi s, asking whether  the entity in the White House  has the “sole \nfunction”  of advising and assisting the President.  See id.  at 1042.  If the answer is yes, it is \nexempt from FOIA.  See id.  at 1043.  Formulated another way, the question is whether an entity \nin the White House  “wield[s] substantial authority independent ly of the President.”  C REW , 566 \nF.3d at  222 (quoting Sweetland v. Walters , 60 F.3d 852, 854 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ).  Under this \nformulation, i f the answer is no, the entity  is exempt from FOIA.  See id.  at 223.   \nThis is  all straightforward enough.  Whatever misgivings the Court may have  about using  \nlegislative histor y, the Court is bound by the higher courts ’ repeated reliance on the conference \nreport the Government identifies.  The D.C. Circuit has  cited that report to hold that not all Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 10 of 2311 entities in the White House  are subject to FOIA, despite the plain terms of § 552(f)(1).  So this \nwould be a much different case if the Commission were in the White House .  But  it is not.  See \nGov’t Mem. at 16–19.  \nThe Government instead derive s a much broader principle from  the conference report and  \nthe Soucie  line of cases .  According to the Government , whenever  it would raise separation of \npowers concerns to say that an entity is subject to FOIA, the text of § 552(f)(1) mus t give way .  \nSee id. at 15 –18.  The canon of constitutional avoidance would kick in , and a court would have \nto apply Soucie ’s functional test to determine whether the entity must comply with FOIA.  See \nid.  Here, the Government says, it would raise separation of powers concerns to say that the \nCommission is an “establishment in the executive branch” subject to FOIA.  See id.  at 18 –19.  \nThe Government reasons  that under Soucie ’s functional test, the Commission does not exercise \n“substantial independent authority” and is thus  exempt from  FOIA.   See id.  at 20.  This argument \nfails for many reasons . \nFirst , the Government misunderstands the canon of constitutional avoidance.  It is not a \nlicense to  ignore unambiguous text.  As the Supreme Court has recently reminded us, \n“constitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction.”  Nielsen v. Preap , \n139 S. Ct. 954, 972 (2019) (cleaned up).  “The canon has no application absent ambiguity.”  Id.  \n(cleaned up).  Ambiguity is absent here, see supra  Section III.A, so the canon does not apply.  \nSecond, Energy Research  strongly supports EPIC’s position.  That  decision came in \n1990.  By then, the D.C. Circuit had decided several cases that applied Soucie ’s functional test .  \nSee, e.g., Rushforth, 762 F.2d at 1040–41.  Yet the textual analysis in Energy Research —\nidentical to the textual analysis here —was dispositive .  See 917 F.2d at 582 –83.  The Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 11 of 2312 Government insists there was no need for constitutional avoidance in Energy Research  because \nthat case “did not raise any separation of powers issues.”  See Gov’t Reply at 7.  Perhaps, but  that \nis irrelevant.  The statutory text here, like the text at issue in Energy Research , is unambiguous .  \nSo constitutional avoidance does not apply here  either.  See Nielsen , 139 S. Ct. at 972. \nTo be sure, Energy Research  did go on to apply Soucie , but only to note that the same \nresult would obtain under a functional approach.  See 917 F.2d at 584–85.  The court was \nreluctant to apply Soucie  at all.   It noted that doing so would conflict with Crooker v. Office of \nthe Pardon Attorney , 614 F.2d 825 (2d Cir. 1980) .  See 917 F.2d at 584.  Crooker  concluded  that \nthe language in the conference report for the 1974 amendment “applies as a limitation upon \nFOIA coverage only within the Executive Office of the President.”  614 F.2d at 828 (emphasis \nadded).  It expressly rejected the Government’s “attempt[] to apply thi s limitation throughout the \nexecutive branch.”  Id.   Crooker  and Energy Research  dealt with entities not in the White House .  \nSee id. at 827–28; 917 F.2d at 582.  So too here.  The text of § 552(f)(1) is therefore dispositive . \nIn any event , as in Energy Research , the same result  obtains under a functional analysis.  \n“Soucie  itself recognized that an entity in the federal government which ‘investigates, evaluates  \nand recommends’ is an ‘agency.’”  Energy Research , 917 F.2d at 585 (quoting Soucie , 448 F.2d \nat 1073 n.15).  The  Commission “performs precisely these functions.”  Id.  Its mandate is to \nevaluate advances in artificial intelligence, and it must consider many  factors in conducting this \nreview.  See  Pub. L. No. 115- 232, § 1051(a)(1), (b)(1) –(2).  The  Commission has received \nseveral briefings from other government agencies.  See Compl. Ex. H.  Its final report will \nprovide its “full findings and recommendations.”  Id. \nIn the Government’s view, EPIC has conceded that the Commission is not an “agency” \nunder a functional analysis.  See Gov’t Reply at 14–15.  T he Court is not so sure.  True,  EPIC Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 12 of 2313 agreed with the Government’s characterization of the Commission as “possess[ing] no \nindependent authority” and “purely advisory in nature.”  EPIC’s Opp’n at 30.  B ut that was part \nof EPIC’s argument for why congressional appointment of the Commission’s members does  not \nviolate the Appointments Clause, U.S. Const. art . II, § 2, cl. 2.  See EPIC’s Opp’n  at 29–30.  \nEPIC never discussed whether the Commission is  an “agency” under a functional test, since it \nargued that this test was irrelevant.  See id.  at 24 –27.   \nIt is also somewhat ironic for the Government  to be insisting that the Commission \npossesses no “independent authority” under Soucie .  Recall that the question is whether an  entity \nexercises  substantial authority independent of the President .  See CREW ., 566 F.3d at 222.  The \nGovernment apparently believes  that the Commission does not  wield this authority.  Yet at the \nsame time , the Government stresses that the President “exerts no control over the Commission’s \nfunctioning.”  Gov’t Mem. at 19. \nAs the functional test is not relevant here, the Court need not press the point more .  \nSuffice it to say that the Commission ’s functions match the functions that were enough for \nEnergy Research  to call  the Nuclear Board an “agency.”   See 917 F.2d at 585. \nThird, the  Government reads far too much into the  Soucie  line of cases .  These cases do \nnot hold that  the functional test applies whenever  imposing FOIA on an entity would raise \nseparation of powers concerns.  They stand for the much narrower proposition that a functional approach is apt when the question is whether an official or entity close to the Presiden t must  \ncomply with FOIA.  “Failure to exempt presidential staff from the FOIA would raise a constitutional issue of separation of powers.”  Ryan v. DOJ , 617 F.2d 781, 788 n.19 (D.C. Cir. \n1980).  The reason is that imposing FOIA’s disclosure obligations on these officials would be “a Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 13 of 2314 potentially serious congressional intrusion into the conduct of the President’s daily operations.”  \nJudicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Secret Serv., 726 F.3d 208, 226 (D.C. Cir. 2013) .5 \nThat is  what the 1974 conference report is about —the conferees wanted to excuse from \nFOIA “the President’s immediate personal staff or units in the Executive Office whose sole \nfunction is to advise and assist the President.”  H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 93- 1380, at 15.  So the cases \nthat rely on this legislative history apply a functional analysis given  a specific  separation of \npowers concern.   That specific concern is not at issue  here.  T his case does not involve  \npresidential staff or  an entity i n the White House .  Indeed, the Government stresses that the \nCommission is far removed  from the President.  It notes that most of the  Commission’s members \nare congressionally appointed and that the President “exerts no control over the Commission’s \nfunctioning.”  Gov’t Mem. at 19.  The Government believes  it would be problematic  “if the \nCommission were actually located within the executive branch.”  Id. at 18.  \nOn that view , the Commission must be either an agent of Congress or an independent \nagency.  The Government fails to explain why it would violate separation of powers for \nCongress to impose FOIA  on either type of entity.  Nor is any constitutional problem apparent.  \nWhile Co ngress has yet to do so, surely it is free to impose the same transparency requirements \n                                                 \n5  The Government here has not  challenged the application of FOIA to the Executive Branch \nmore generally.  Cf.  William P. Barr, Attorney Gen., U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 19th Annual Barbara \nK. Olson Memorial Lecture  (Nov. 15, 2019), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney -\ngeneral -william- p-barr-delivers -19th- annual -barbara -k-olson- memorial- lecture (remarks as \nprepared for delivery) (“[W]e all understand that confidential communications and a private, \ninternal deliberative process are essential for all of our branches of government to properly \nfunction. . . .  Yet Congress has happily created a regim e [under FOIA] that allows the public to \nseek whatever documents it wants from the Executive Branch at the same time that individual congressional committees spend their days trying to publicize the Executive’s internal decisional process.  That process ca nnot function properly if it is public[.]”). Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 14 of 2315 on its own agents that it has imposed on the Executive Branch.  And imposing disclosure \nobligations on independent agencies would not intrude on the President’s  daily o perations.  \nFor these reasons , the D.C. Circuit’s decision i n Judicial Watch is distinguishable.  The \nGovernment never describes the facts of this case, but repeatedly cites it for the proposition that \nseparation of powers  always  mandates a functional approach when interpreting FOIA.  See  id. at \n14–17, 19.  A close look reveals a more mode st holding.  \nThe question in Judicial Watch was whether White House visitor logs in the Secret \nService’s possession were “agency records” under  FOIA.  See 726 F.3d at 211.  The  Secret \nService is not in the President’s Executive Office, but t he court held that some of these logs were \nnot agency records —the logs that disclosed “the appointment calendars of the President and his \nclose advisors.”  Id.  One reason for this holding was that documents in the possession of the \nPresident  and his advisers “are excluded from FOIA.”  See id. at 224–25.  That much was clear \nfrom FOIA’s implicit carveout for “the President’s immediate personal staff or units in the \nExecutive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the President.”  See id.  (quoting \nKissinger , 445 U.S. at 156).  This carveout avoids “render[ing] FOIA a potentially serious \ncongressional intrusion into the conduct of the President’s daily operations.”  Id.  at 226.  \nAllowing plaintiffs to access the President’s appointment calendars simply by targeting the Secret Service would have undermined this legislative scheme.  See id. at 225 –27.  The court \nthought it implausible that Congress intended this loophole.  See id.  at 225.  \nThis case, by contrast, implicates no  loophole.  The Government has not claimed that \nEPIC is trying to use its FOIA request to access  the records of the President or his close advisers.  \nRecall that the Government empha sizes  how the  Comm ission is far removed  from the President.  \nSo the separation of powers concerns in Judicial Watch are irrelevant . Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 15 of 2316 The Government insists, however, that the D.C. Circuit has at other times applied \nSoucie ’s functional test to entities not  in the White House .  See  Gov’t Mem. at 16–17; Gov’t \nReply at 12 n.2.  Like Judicial Watch , these cases are all distinguishable, and none of them \nrequires the Court to apply a functional test here.  \nFirst up is the D.C. Circuit ’s holding  in September 1974 that biomedic ine research \npanels, called initial review groups, were not agencies subject to FOIA.  See Wash . Research \nProject, Inc. v. Dep’ t of Health, Educ . & Welfare , 504 F.2d 238, 248 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  The court \napplied Soucie ’s functional test to determine whethe r an initial review group was an “authority of \nthe Government” under  5 U.S.C. § 551(1).  See id.  at 245–48.  This decision came two months \nbefore  Congress amended FOIA to specify that “authority of the Government” included \n“any  . . . establishment in the e xecutive branch.”  See Pub. L. No. 93- 502, 88 Stat. 1561, 1564 \n(Nov. 21, 1974).  So  the court  had no occasion to consider whether a functional analysis is \nnecessary when Congress has said that an entity is an “establishment in the executive branch .”  \nThe G overnment’s reliance on Washington Research Project  is therefore  misplaced . \nAlso misplaced is the Government’s reliance on Dong v. Smithsonian Institution, 125 \nF.3d 877 (D.C. Cir. 1997).  Dong held that the Smithsonian Institution was not an “agency” \nunder the Privacy Act.  Id. at 879.  The Privacy Act “borrows the definition of ‘agency’ found in FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(f).”  Id.  at 878.  T he Smithsonian i s not in the Executive Office, yet the  \ncourt applied Soucie ’s functional approac h.  See id.  at 879, 881.  The court opined, moreover, \nthat the method of appointment for the Smithsonian’s Regents “would appear to violate the Constitution’s separation of powers principles.”   Id. at 879.  From this, the Government contends \nthat a functional approach applies for units  not in  the Executive Office “when separation of Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 16 of 2317 powers issues exist.”  Gov’t Mem. at 16, 18–19.  Dong does not stand for that proposition.  \nIndeed, t he Government’s  reading of Dong takes much of its analysis out of context . \nIt helps  to read Dong, as with any opinion, from beginning to end.  The decision began by \nobserving that an “agency” under FOIA and the Privacy Act “encompasses not only all entities covered by § 552(f) but also all those described by § 551(1).”   125 F.3d at 879.  So to be an \n“agency,” an entity “must fit into one  of the categories set forth either in § 552(f ) or § 551(1).”  \nId. (emphasis added).  The court first asked whether the Smithsonian  fit into any  categories in  \n§ 552(f)(1).  Id.   It considered two candidates: “establishment in the executive branch” and \n“Government controlled corporation.”  Id.   But the  Smithsonian was neither .  Id. at 879–80.  \nSeparation of powers was one reason  the Smithsonian was not  an “establishment in the \nexecutive branch.”  See id.  at 879.  Most  members of the Smithsonian’s Board of Regents were \neither congressional appointees or members of Congress.  Id.   The court commented  that this \nmethod of appointing the Regents “would appear to violate the Constitution’s separation of \npowers principles” if  the Smithsonian “were to wield executive powers.”  Id. \nThe Government believes that the same  reasoning applies here , since members of \nCongress appoint most of the Commission’s members.  See Gov’t Mem. at 19.  But Dong is \ndistinguishable on this score.  Co ngress did not specify  whether the Smithsonian was an \n“establishment in the executive branch. ”  See 20 U.S.C. § 41.  So  in answering that question, it \nmade sense for  Dong to consider non- textual factors such as separation of powers .  See  125 F.3d \nat 879.       \nOnly after  concluding that the Smithsonian did not fit into any categories in § 552(f)(1) \ndid the court apply Soucie ’s functional approach.  See 125 F.3d at 880.  It did so to determine \nwhether the Smithsonian was an “authority of the Government” under  § 551(1).  See id.  at 880–Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 17 of 2319 The Government next cites  a pair of cases that concluded the Tax Court is not an \n“agency” subject to FOIA.   Gov’t Mem. at 17; s ee Megibow v. Clerk of the U.S. Tax Court , 432 \nF.3d 387, 388 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam)  (adopting the reasoning of Megibow v. Clerk of the \nU.S. Tax Court , No. 04 Civ. 3321, 2004 WL 1961591 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2004) ); Byers v. U.S. \nTax Court , 211 F. Supp. 3d 240 (D.D.C. 2016) .  Megibow  examined the Tax Court’s functions \nand determined that it was a court, rather than an entity in  the E xecutive Branch.  See  No. 04 \nCiv. 3321, 2004 WL 1961591, at *5.  Byers , meanwhile, had the benefit of a  decision that had \ndeemed the Tax Court “part of the Executive Branch” in the context of “ a separation of powers \nanalysis.”  See 211 F. Supp. 3d at 247 (citing Kuretski v. Comm’r , 755 F.3d 929, 943 (D.C. Cir. \n2014) ).  Relying on Kuretski , the plaintiff in Byers  argued that the Tax Court was necessarily an \n“establishment in the executive branch” subject to FOIA.  See id.  at 248.  The court rejected that \nargument.  See id.  \n   Both Megibow  and Byers  are distinguishable .  Those cases dealt with an exception to \nFOIA  for “the courts of the United States.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(1)(B).   As Byers  put it: “If the Tax \nCourt is one of the ‘courts of the United States,’ it must be exempt from FOIA, even if it is part \nof the Executive Branch.”  211 F. Supp. 3d at 248.  The  exception for “courts of the United \nStates” is of course not relevant here.  \nIn sum, an “agency”  subject to FOIA  includes “any  . . . establishment in the executive \nbranch.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1).  Congress chose to call the Commission  an “establishment in the \nexecutive branch.”  See Pub. L. No. 115 -232, § 1051(a) .  The Government has not  convinced the \nCourt that it should ignore what Congress said.  And even under  the Government’s preferred \nfunctional approach, the  Commission is still s ubject to FOIA.   The Court  thus concludes that the \nCommission must comply with FOIA.  Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 19 of 2320 C. \n The Government contends that the Court can dismiss Counts VI and VII at this stage \neven if the Commission is an agency.  See Gov’t Mem. at 12–13.  Recall that  Count VI asserts a \nclaim under FOIA based on the failure of the Commission and DOD to comply with the statute’s \ndeadlines.  Compl. ¶¶ 147–52.  Count VII alleges that the Commission and DOD unlawfully denied expedited processing of EPIC’s FOIA  requests.  Id.  ¶¶ 154–58.  \n To begin, the Court sees nothing procedurally improper with the Government’s choice to \nseek dismissal of Counts VI and VII in the present motion.  The Court observes, however, that \nCounts VI and VII now have little , if any,  practical relevance.  The Government has not  yet \nsought dismissal of Count VIII, which alleges that both the Commission and DOD have \n“wrongfully withheld agency records ” under FOIA.   Id. ¶¶ 160–61.\n7  Since the Commission is an \nagency subject to FOIA, Count VIII against that entity will remain for now .  EPIC’s FOIA \nrequest was the first one  the Commission received, see Tr. of Prelim. Inj. Hr’g at 31, so E PIC’s \nrequest will automatically take precedence, even if  it can not meet the criteria for expedited \nprocessing.  DOD, of course, already has thousands of other pending requests.  Compl. Ex. C.  \nBut the Commission, not DOD, likely has the records  that EPIC wants.  See  Tr. of Prelim. Inj. \nHr’g at 32.  So if this matter proceeds as a standard FOIA case against the Commission under \nCount VIII, EPIC  would be on track to get as much relief as it can, no matter  what the Court \ndoes with Counts VI or VII.  \n1. \n In any event, the Court declines to dismiss either count  now .  Count VI alleges that both \nthe Commission and DOD violated various  statutory deadlines  related to EPIC’s FOIA requests .  \n                                                 \n7 The Government is “separately answering” Count VIII .  Partial Mot. to Dismiss  at 1 n.1.    Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 20 of 2321 See Compl. ¶¶ 147–50.  The Government  contends that  the Court should dismiss Count VI \nbecause it is superfluous.  See Gov’t Mem. at 26.  That is, violation of statutory deadlines is “ not \nan independent basis for a claim ,” Roseberry -Andrews v. DHS , 299 F. Supp. 3d 9, 20 (D.D.C. \n2018), but it is merely a reason why  FOIA requesters can sue  in the first place.   See Citizens for \nResponsibility & Ethics in Wash. v. FEC , 711 F.3d 180, 189–90 (D.C. Cir. 2013). \n Since violation of FOIA’s deadlines goes to whether EPIC has exhausted its \nadministrative remedies,  see id., Count VI is intertwined  with the other two FOIA counts, \nincluding the yet -unanswered Count VIII.  Based on  EPIC’s allegations, it appears that the \nCommission and DOD violated at least three deadlines .  DOD did not make a “determination” on \nEPIC’s FOIA request within 20 days.  Compl. ¶¶ 106–07, 149.  After D OD denied EPIC’s \nrequest for expedited processing, it never made a “determination ” on EPIC’s administrative \nappeal of that denial.   Id. ¶¶ 109–10, 150.  And the Commission failed to make a “deter mination ” \non EPIC’s request for expedited processing within ten days .  Id. ¶¶ 95, 97, 148.  Exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies may yet become an issue once the Government answers Count VIII.  So \nthe Court finds  it best to hold off for now disposing of  Count VI .8  If exhaustion does not \nbecome an  issue, the Court will decide at a later point, if necessary, what to do with this count .  \nIf the Government is correct that Count VI provides no independent basis for relief, it has \nnothing to fear from that claim in the meantime .  The Court will not dismiss Count VI now . \n                                                 \n8  One paragraph in Count VI alleges that the Commission failed to make a timely determination \non EPIC’s Septem ber 11 FOIA request.  Compl. ¶  147.  FOIA gives the agency at least 20 days \nto make this determination.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i) , (a)(6)(B)(i).  But EPIC filed its \nComplaint on September 27, only 16 days  after its September 11 request.   Compl. ¶  95.  Based \non this, the Government contends that the Court may dismiss  as premature “Plaintiff’s claim that \nthe AI Commission did not respond timely to its FOIA request.”  Gov’t Mem. at 12 n.4.  At this \nstage, however, the Court declines to excise paragra ph 147 from Count VI.  EPIC’s rush to the \ncourthouse may or may not be relevant to Count  VIII, but the Government is not currently \nseeking dismissal of Count VIII.  See  Partial Mot. to Dismiss at 1  n.1. Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 21 of 2322 2. \nAs to Count VII, the Court holds  that EPIC has stated a plausible claim that DOD and the \nCommission unlawfully denied expedited processing.  A FOIA requester gets expedited  \nprocessing if it “demonstrates a compelling need.”  5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I).  As relevant \nhere, “compelling need” means “urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity .”  Id. § 552(a)(6)(E)(v)(II).  The Governm ent contends that EPIC  \nfails to establish  this sort of “urgency.”  See Gov’t Mem. at 22–26. \nTo answer this question, “courts must consider at least three factors: (1) whether the \nrequest concerns a matter of current exigency to the American public; (2) w hether the \nconsequences of delaying a response would compromise a significant recognized interest; and (3) whether the request concerns federal government activity.”  Al-Fayed v. CIA , 254 F.3d 300, \n310 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  EPIC has plausibly alleged that its  requests met all three factors.    \nThe third factor  is the most straightforward.  EPIC  sought  records about  the work of the \nCommission, a federal  agency, and  EPIC asserts  the records  are also relevant to action that the \nPresident or Congress may take in response to the Commission’s recommendations.  See Compl. ¶¶ 91, 101.  EPIC has thus plausibly alleged that its requests concerned “federal government activity.”  \nThe Cour t’s conclusion is the same for the  first and second factors .  When EPIC \nrequested expedited processing from DOD in February 2019, the  Commission had not yet \nreleased its initial report, let alone its interim report.   See id. ¶  101.  There was still no interim \nreport when EPIC requested expedited processing from the  Commission in September.  See id.  \n¶ 90.  EPIC claimed that the findings in these reports would affect  government policy.  See id.  \n¶¶ 91, 101.  It was thus  urgent that the public have access t o these reports and related  records, Case 1:19-cv-02906-TNM   Document 26   Filed 12/03/19   Page 22 of 2323 such as briefing materials and minutes from meetings.  See id. ¶¶ 90, 101.  Access would allow  \nEPIC and  the public to understand and critique the Commission’s work .  The Commission will \nsubmit its “full findings and rec ommendations” in August 2020, see  Compl. Ex. I, so if records \nremain out of public view, EPIC and the public  might have little  opportunity to influence the \nCommission’s recommendations . \nEPIC also m akes other allegations that suggest the Commission’s work w as and remains \na matter of “current exigency” and that  delay in receiving records would compromise a \n“significant recognized interest.”  For example,  the President has launched an “American AI \nInitiative” by Executive Order.   See Compl. ¶¶ 35, 101; id. Ex. B at 4 & n.22.  So the \nGovernment itself is prioritizing artificial intelligence.   Yet the Commission  “has operated \nalmost entirely in secret.”  Com pl. ¶ 59.  And EPIC stresses that policy in this area could res hape \nprivacy  and human rights.  Id.  ¶¶ 5, 22–26.  E vidence such as news articles  and other \ncontemporary documents may illuminate whether  EPIC’s FOIA requests meet the “urgency to \ninform” standard.  The Court concludes  only that EPIC  has strung together enough allegations on \nthis score to pass  the plausibility threshold.  The Court thus will not dismiss Count VII.  \nIV. \nFor all these reasons , it is  hereby  \nORDERED that the Government’s [23] Motion to Dismiss FOIA Claims is DENIED . \nSO ORDERED. \n \n \n      \nDated: December  3, 201 9    TREVOR N.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, the plaintiff, Darion Dion Frederick, filed a complaint against \"Artificial Intelligence Fields,\" claiming emotional and physical distress purportedly caused by extraterrestrial beings. The court granted Frederick the ability to proceed without paying fees due to indigency but recommended dismissal of his case for being frivolous and lacking a valid legal claim. The case involves AI as the defendant, but the claims are not rooted in any factual or legal substance concerning artificial intelligence, thus leading to dismissal.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Frederick’s complaint presents a non-frivolous claim that falls within the jurisdiction of the federal court.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Frederick's complaint is frivolous and fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, recommending dismissal of the action with prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone tries to file a lawsuit claiming aliens are causing them distress, and they name an AI as the defendant because they think it might be involved somehow. The court looked at this case and said, \"This doesn't make any sense in law, and there's nothing we can legally do about it,\" so they decided the case shouldn't proceed.",
    "full_text": "1 \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nWESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS  \nAUSTIN  DIVISION  \n \nDARION DION FREDERICK,  \nPlaintiff  \n \nv. \n \nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FIELDS,  \nDefendant  \n § \n§ § \n§ \n§ § §  \n  \n   Case No.  1: 23-CV-01149- DII \n \nORDER AND REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nOF THE UNITED STATES MAGISTRATE JUDGE  \n   \nTO: THE HONORABLE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE  \n \nThe undersigned submits this report and recommendation to the United States \nDistrict Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Rule 1 of Appendix C of the Local \nCourt Rules of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, \nLocal Rules for the Assignment of Duties to United States Magistrate Judges.  \nBefore the Court is Plaintiff Darion Dion Fred erick ’s Application to Proceed In  \nForma Pauperis. Dkt. 2. Because Frederick  is requesting permission to proceed in \nforma pauperis, the undersigned must review and make a recommendation on the \nmerits of his  claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e).  \nI. REQUEST TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS  \nThe Court has reviewed Frederick ’s financial affidavit and determined that \nFrederick  is indigent and should be granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis. \nAccordingly, the Court hereby GRANTS  Frederick ’s request for in forma pauperis Case 1:23-cv-01149-RP   Document 5   Filed 02/01/24   Page 1 of 52 \n status, Dkt.  2. The Clerk of the Court shall file the complaint without payment of fees \nor costs or giving security therefor pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a). This indigent \nstatus is granted subject to a later determination that the action should be dismissed \nif the alle gation of poverty is untrue or the action is found frivolous or malicious \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). Frederick  is further advised that, although  he has \nbeen granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, a court may, in its discretion, impose \ncosts of court at the conclusion of this lawsuit, as in other cases. Moore v. McDonald , \n30 F.3d 616, 621 (5th Cir. 1994).  \nAs stated below, the undersigned has made a § 1915(e) review of the claims \nmade in this complaint and is recommending  Frederick ’s claims be dismissed under \n28 U.S.C. § 1915(e). Therefore, service upon  Defendant  should be withheld pending \nthe District Court’s review of the recommendations made in this report. If the District \nCourt declines to adopt the recommendations, then service should be issued at that \ntime upon  Defendant . \nII. REVIEW OF THE MERITS OF THE CLAIM  \nBecause  Frederick  has been granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, the \nundersigned is required by statute to review the Complaint. Section 1915(e)(2) provides in relevant part that “the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court \ndetermines that … the action or appeal (i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state \na claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a \ndefendant who is immune from such relief.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). A complaint is \nfrivolous if it “lacks an arguable basis either in law or in fact.” Neitzke v. Williams , Case 1:23-cv-01149-RP   Document 5   Filed 02/01/24   Page 2 of 53 \n 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989); Siglar v. Hightower , 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997). A \nclaim lacks an arguable basis in law when it is “based on an indisputably meritless \nlegal theory.” Neitzke , 490 U.S. at 327.  \nPro se complaints are liberally construed in favor of the plaintiff. Haines v. \nKerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520- 21 (1972). However, pro se status does not offer a plaintiff \nan “impenetrable shield, for one acting pro se has no license to harass others, clog the judicial machinery with meritless litigation, and abuse already overloaded court \ndocke ts.” Farguson v. MBank Houston N.A. , 808 F.2d 358, 359 (5th Cir. 1986).  \nFrederick brings a complaint for his “emotion [al] and physical wellbeing” and \n“emotional traumatization,” apparently caused by “alien friends from other planets” \nthat “torture kids and torture adults.” Dkt. 1, at 1. While Frederick’s Civil Cover \nSheet indicates that his basis for jurisdiction is “U.S. Government Defendant,” Dkt. \n1-2, at 1, he  is suing “Artificial Intelligence Fields.”  \n“Some claims are ‘so unsubstantial, implausible, … or otherwise completely \ndevoid of merit as to not involve a federal controversy.’” Atakapa Indian de Creole \nNation v. Louisiana, 943 F.3d 1004 (5th Cir. 2019)  (quoting Oneida Indian Nation of \nN.Y. v. Oneida Cnty. , 414 U.S. 661, 666 (1974)). Where, as here, a plaintiff’s complaint \nis “insubstantial, it is insufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of a federal court.” \nDilworth v. Dall. Cnty. Cmty, Coll. Dist., 81 F.3d 616, 617 (5th Cir. 1996); see Denton \nv. Hernandez , 504 U.S. 25, 32 (1992) (explaining that factually frivolous complaints \ninvolve allegations which are “‘clearly baseless’ … whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them” (quoting Neitzke , 490 U.S. at 327)); Bell Case 1:23-cv-01149-RP   Document 5   Filed 02/01/24   Page 3 of 54 \n v. Hood , 327 U.S. 678, 682- 83 (1946). That is, federal courts lack subject matter \njurisdiction over claims which are “insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior \ndecisions ..., or otherwise completely devoid of merit as not to involve a federal \ncontroversy.” Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t , 523 U.S. 83, 89 (1998).  \nBased on the foregoing, the undersigned finds that Frederick ’s complaint is \nboth frivolous and fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted by this Court. \nFrederick ’s complaint should be dismissed.  \nIII. ORDER AND RECOMMENDATION  \nThe undersigned hereby GRANTS  Frederick ’s Application to Proceed In \nForma Pauperis. Dkt. 2 . The undersigned RECOMMENDS  the District Court \nDISMISS  Frederick ’s cause of action with prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1915(e)(2)(B).  \nThe referral of this case to the Magistrate Judge should now be canceled.  \nIV. WARNINGS  \nThe parties may file objections to this Report and Recommendation. A party \nfiling objections must specifically identify those findings or recommendations to \nwhich objections are being made. The District Court need not consider frivolous, conclusive, or general objections. See Battle v. United States Parole Comm’n , 834 F.2d \n419, 421 (5th Cir. 1987). A party’s failure to file written objections to the proposed findings and recommendations contained in this Report within fourteen days after \nthe party is served with a copy of the Report shall bar that party from de novo  review \nby the District Court of the proposed findings and recommendations in the Report Case 1:23-cv-01149-RP   Document 5   Filed 02/01/24   Page 4 of 55 \n \nand, except upon grounds of plain error, shall bar the party from appellate review of \nunobjected- to proposed factual findings and legal conclusions accepted by the District \nCourt. See 28 U.S.C. §  636(b)(1)(C); Thomas v. Arn , 474 U.S. 140, 150- 53 (1985); \nDouglass v. United Servs. Auto.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Darion Dion Frederick vs. Artificial Intelligence Fields, the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas reviewed a report and recommendation issued by Magistrate Judge Dustin Howell. The court ultimately dismissed Frederick’s complaint without prejudice due to the lack of timely objections filed by the plaintiff against the magistrate judge’s recommendations. The case involves artificial intelligence as it is explicitly mentioned in the title of the defendant, suggesting that the claims or disputes may be related to or involve AI systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether the plaintiff's complaint had any merit to proceed further, which was contingent upon objections being filed against the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff's failure to file timely objections to the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation warranted a review for clear error, and, finding none, it dismissed the complaint without prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you’re trying to tell the teacher about a problem you have, and the teacher gives a report saying that your problem isn’t big enough to deal with.
