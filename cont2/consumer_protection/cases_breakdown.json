Plaintiffs allege that Upstart made misleading statements about \u201ctheir AI underwriting model and business risks.\u201d The AI model was \u201callegedly promoted to be superior to traditional credit scoring\u201d and was described as having capabilities that made it more effective and adaptable than conventional methods. Plaintiffs claim that Upstart misled investors about \u201cthe effectiveness and adaptability of their AI-driven lending model,\u201d including its ability to \u201cadapt well to changing economic conditions.\u201d According to the summary, the court allowed claims to proceed regarding \u201cspecific statements about the AI model's superiority, adaptability to economic changes, and temporary nature of borrowing issues,\u201d while dismissing other claims. Upstart\u2019s AI model is described as \u201ccentral to the case\u201d because it was marketed as a superior, adaptive system but allegedly \u201cdid not adapt well to changing economic conditions, leading to financial losses for investors.\u201d",

The court allows certain securities claims to proceed that are tied to alleged misrepresentations about Meta\u2019s use of algorithms to moderate harmful content and about the impact of Instagram\u2019s algorithm-driven platform on young users, indicating that Meta\u2019s automated and algorithmic systems are central factual issues in the litigation.",
