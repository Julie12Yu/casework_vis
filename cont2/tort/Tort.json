    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n    The case involves a property dispute between Dutch Girl Plaza LLC and several petroleum companies over contamination of Dutch Girl's property by petroleum products originating from a neighboring gas station. The court partially grants and partially denies the defendants' motion to dismiss, permitting some claims to proceed while dismissing others due to issues such as the statute of limitations and inadequate pleading. AI involvement is noted as the plaintiffs' attorney inadvertently cited non-existent cases in their arguments, attributable to reliance on AI software.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**:\n    The key legal issue centers on whether the defendants are liable for contamination under both federal and state environmental laws despite statutory exceptions for petroleum products, and whether the claims are barred by statutes of limitations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**:\n    The court dismissed several of Dutch Girl's claims, including their CERCLA and HSAA claims, due to the petroleum exclusion and the statute of limitations, as well as dismissing negligence claims and claims related to Proposition 65 and indemnity due to insufficient factual allegations. However, the court retained claims related to continuing trespass and nuisance.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**:\n    Imagine you spill something on your neighbor's yard, and it makes their plants sick. They want you to clean it up and pay for damages. You argue that it wasn’t illegal to spill what you did and that they've known about the spill for too long without taking legal action. In court, some of their complaints are dismissed because they waited too long to bring them up or didn’t have enough evidence to support them. However, some complaints about ongoing problems with the spill are still valid and need to be addressed. Also, their lawyer used an AI to help write their complaint, and it ended up including some incorrect information.",

ECF No. 21.  The Court will grant the \nmotion in part and deny it in part . \nI. BACKGROUND  \n  For purpose s of resolving the motion to dismiss, the Court accepts as true the allegations in \nthe complaint, ECF No. 1 .  Knievel v. ESPN , 393 F.3d 1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2005).   Plaintiffs \nDutch Girl Plaza LLC and Steven H. Depper —a member of Dutch Girl —own the lot at 2094 \nMount Diablo Boulevard.  ECF No. 1 ¶  1.  Dutch Girl currently uses the property as an eco -\nfriendly dry -cleaning facility and has gained approvals to transform  the property into a mixed -use \nresidential and commercial development.  Id. ¶ 2.   \nAt 2098 Mount Diablo Boulevard, adjacent to the Dutch Girl lot, is a site owned and \noperated by Defendants for many years as a gas station.  Id. ¶¶ 4–7.  In 1987, when Conoco, Inc. \n(not a defendant here) operated the gas station, a leaking underground storage tank containing \nwaste oil was removed from the site.  Oil, grease, and diesel contamination was identified in the \nsoil, and the unauthorized release of gasoline was also discovered at the site.  Id. ¶ 38.  In 2004, Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 1 of 16 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendant Tesoro Companies directed the commission of environmental testing, which found that \nchemicals of concern remained present in the soil and groundwater.  Id. ¶ 43.  In 2007, Plaintiffs \nand Defendants reached an agreement for Defendants to install groundwater monitoring wells on \nthe Dutch Girl property.  At that time, Plaintiffs first learned that contamination from Defendants’ \nproperty had migrated into the Du tch Girl property, including into the groundwater.  Id. ¶ 46.  \nDespite “repeated assurance for over a decade that [Defendants] would address the contamination \nat the Dutch Girl Property, the contamination remains to this day.”  Id. ¶ 57.  Ongoing testing \nshows the continued presence of benzene, naphthalene, ethylbenzene, waste oil, and other \npetroleum products.  Id. ¶ 13.  Around February 26, 2023, Proposition 65 chemicals originating \nfrom Defendants’ site were discovered in the indoor air of the Dutch Girl building and were \ndetermined to pose human health risks by inhalation to workers and tenan ts.  Id. ¶ 55.   \nPlaintiffs fear that “contamination that has migrated from Defendants’ property onto \nPlaintiffs’ Property will be exposed during construction, creating a toxic hazard for both workers \non the Site and for the future residents of the Property,” which ultimat ely “may prevent future \ndevelopment of the Dutch Girl Property .”  Id. ¶ 11.  They filed this action on February 10, 2025 , \nbringing claims for : (1) response costs under the Comprehensive Environmental, Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 4 2 U.S.C. §  9607(a); (2) declaratory relief under \nCERCLA; (3) response costs and damages under California’s Carpenter -Presley -Tanner \nHazardous Substances Act (“HSAA”), Cal. Health & Safety Code §§  25300 –25395.45 ; (4) \ndeclaratory relief under the HSAA; (5) continuing trespass; (6) continuing private nuisance; (7) \ncontinuing public nuisance; (8) negligence; (9) negligence per se; (10) common law equitable \nindemnity; (11) express indemnity; (12) declaratory judgment  under state law; (13) injunctive \nrelief under  state law; and (14) violation of California’s Proposition 65.   \nDefendants moved to dismiss on April 4, 2025.  ECF No. 21.  Plaintiffs oppose d the \nmotion, ECF No. 28, and Defendants filed a reply, ECF No. 30.  Plaintiffs subsequently filed \nerrata, acknowledging  that three citations in its opposition referred to “nonexisten t cases” and \nwere the product of an attorney’s “reliance upon artificial intelligence software ,” and requesting \nthat the Court strike the problematic citations.  ECF No. 31.  On June 2, 2025, the Court took this Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 2 of 16 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  matter under submission without a hearing.  See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 78(b); Civ. L.R. 7 -1(b).  \nII. JURISDICTION  \nThe Court has jurisdiction under  28 U.S.C. §  1331 . \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nA complaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the \npleader is entitled to relief.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).   “Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is \nappropriate only where the complaint lacks a cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support \na cognizable legal theory.”   Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr ., 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th \nCir. 2008).  A complaint need not contain detailed factual allegations, but facts pleaded by a \nplaintiff “must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555  (2007).  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678  (2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  “A \nclaim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw \nthe reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for  the misconduct alleged.”   Id.  The Court \nmust “accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light \nmost favorable to the nonmoving party.”   Knievel , 393 F.3d at 1072.   However, the Court is not \n“required to accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, \nor unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig ., 536 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \nIV. REQUEST S FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE  AND INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE  \n“As a general rule, [courts] ‘may not consider any material beyond the pleadings in ruling \non a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.’”   United States v. Corinthian Colleges , 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th Cir. \n2011) (quoting Lee v. City of Los Angeles , 250 F.3d 668, 688 (9th Cir. 2001)). “When ‘matters \noutside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court,’ the 12(b)(6) motion converts \ninto a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56,” unless those matters satisfy the \n“incorporation -by-reference doctrine” or the standard for “judicial notice under Federal Rule of \nEvidence 201.”   Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. , 899 F.3d 988, 998 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 3 of 16 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d)).  The Ninth Circuit has expressed concern with the practice of “exploiting \nthese procedures improperly to defeat what would otherwise constitute adequately stated claims at \nthe pleading stage.”   Id.  The Ninth Circuit also cautioned that “[i]f defendants are permitted to \npresent their own version of the facts at the pleading stage —and district courts accept those facts \nas uncontroverted and true —it becomes near impossible for even the most aggrieved p laintiff to \ndemonstrate a sufficie ntly ‘plausible’ claim for relief.”  Id. at 999.   \n“Judicial notice under Rule 201 permits a court to notice an adjudicative fact if it is ‘not \nsubject to reasonable dispute,’” i.e., the fact “is ‘generally known,’ or ‘can be accurately and \nreadily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be  questioned.’”  Id. (quoting \nFed. R. Evid. 201(b)).  “Unlike rule -established judicial notice, incorporation -by-reference is a \njudicially created doctrine that treats certain documents as though they are part of the complaint \nitself.”   Id. at 1002.  Docum ents “may be incorporated by reference into a complaint if the plaintiff \nrefers extensively to the document or the document forms the basis of the plaintiff ’s claim,” \nUnited States v. Ritchie , 342 F.3d 903, 908 (9th Cir. 2003), and “the documents’ authenticity . . . is \nnot contested,” Lee, 250 F.3d at 688 (alteration in original) (quotation marks and citation omitted). \n“[T]he mere mention of the existence of a document is insufficient to incorporate the contents of a \ndocument.” Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg , 593 F.3d 1031, 1038 (9th Cir. 2010).  \nA. Defendants’ Requests   \nDefendants request that the Court take judicial notice of “California State Water Resources \nControl Board, GeoTracker Site Profile for Global ID T0601300315, ‘Site Maps / Documents’ \ntab,” lodged  at ECF No. 22 -2.  Because courts regularly take judicial notice of government \ndocuments, and Dutch Girl does  not oppose Defendants’ request , the Court takes judicial notice of \nthe existence of this government webpage , but not the truth of the matters asserted in it.  See Salas \nv. Gomez , No. 14 -CV-01676 -JST, 2016 WL 3971206, at *5 (N.D. Cal. July 25, 2016); see also In \nre Bare Escentuals, Inc. Sec. Lit ig., 745 F. Supp. 2d 1052, 1067 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (explaining that \nthe court “may take judicial notice of the existence of unrelated court documents .  . . it will not \ntake judicial notice of such documents for the truth of the matter asserted therein”).  \nDefendants ask the Court to consider several documents  as incorporated by reference into Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 4 of 16 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the complaint.  ECF No. 21 at 10 n.1.  Exhibit A is a September 7, 2007 , Right of Entry \nAgreement  between Plaintiff Depper and Defendant Tesoro Environmental .  ECF No. 21 -2.  \nExhibit B is a n October 1,  2008 , Right of Entry Agreement between Depper and Tesoro \nEnvironmental .  ECF No. 21 -3.  Exhibit C is a September 27, 2016 Right of Entry Agreement \nbetween Depper and Tesoro Environmental .  ECF No. 21 -4.  Exhibit D is an October 25, 2018 \n“60-Day Notice of Violation under Proposition 65” sent by Depper to Tesor o Refining and \nMarathon Petroleum.  ECF No. 21 -5.  The complaint explicitly references each of these \ndocuments  and describes their contents .  ECF No. 1 ¶¶  47, 49, 69 –70.  Given that , and in the \nabsence of any objection from Dutch Girl, the Court considers these four  documents under the \nincorporation -by-reference doctrine.  \nThe final document, Exhibit E, is a June 24, 2024 “No Further Action Letter with Case \nClosure Summary,” sent by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board.  ECF \nNo. 21 -6.  While the complaint mentions  that “the Regional Board closed the Site” on June 24, \n2024, ECF No. 1 ¶  55, n.7, the Court rejects Defendants’ contention that this sparse phrase \nincorporates by reference the letter informing Defendant Marathon of the case closure and \ndetailing the reasons supporting the closure.  See Coto Set tlement , 593 F.3d at 1038 (“[T]he mere \nmention of the existence of a document is insufficient to incorporate the contents of a \ndocument.”).   The Court will not consider Defendants’ Exhibit E.   \nB. Plaintiffs’ Request  \nPlaintiffs attach to their opposition a June 6, 2019 Indemnity Agreement signed by Tesoro \nRefining.  ECF No. 28 -2.  The opposition quotes from and relies on this document in response to \nseveral of Defendants’ arguments.  See, e.g. , ECF No. 28 at 13, 18, 22.  But this document is not \npled in the complaint, nor do Plaintiffs ask the Court to take judicial notice of it or deem it \nincorporated by reference in the complaint.  Accordingly, The Court does not rely on it in deciding \nthis motion.  See United States v. Corinthian Colleges , 655 F.3d 984, 998 (9th Cir. 2011).   \n/ / / \n/ / / \n/ / / Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 5 of 16 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  V. DISCUSSION  \nA. CERCLA and HSAA Claims  \n1. Petroleum Exclusion  \nDefendants argue that CERCLA’s and HSAA’s petroleum exclusion applies and thus \nDutch Girl does not state a claim for relief on its claims brought under those statutes.  ECF No. 21 \nat 14 –15.  Under the petroleum exclusions, CERCLA’s definition of “pollutant or contaminant” \nand HSAA’s definition of “hazardous substance” each specifically exclude “petroleum,” “crude \noil,” and “natural gas.”  42 U.S.C. §  9601(33); Cal. Health & Safety Code §  78075(b)(1).  Dutch \nGirl contends tha t it pleads the release of “waste  oil” at the site, ECF No. 1 ¶¶ 3, 13, 38, which “is \noften mixed with other contaminants, including solvents . . . such as TCE and PCE.”  ECF No. 28 \nat 10 –11.  Dutch Girl argues  that “subsequent monitoring [at the site] has found contamination \nfrom . . . TCE and PCE,” and “[t]he presence of these chemicals brings this case outside the \npetroleum exclusion.”  Id.   \nThe problem with this argument, as Defendants point out, is that Dutch Girl does not plea d \nthe presence of TCE and PCE in its complaint.  That Dutch Girl pleads the release of waste oil, \nwhich according to its argument in opposition “is often mixed with other contaminants,” is \ninsufficient alone to bring its claims outside the petroleum exclusi ons.  Members of Beede Site \nGroup v. Federal Hom Loan Mortgage Corp. , which Plaintiffs cite for the proposition that “[t] he \naddition of non -petroleum -based solvents r emoves the pollution from the protections offered  by \nthe petroleum exclusion ,” does not help them.  See ECF No. 28 at 10 (citing Beede , 968 F. Supp. \n2d 455, 461 (D.N.H. 2013) ).  In that case, the court found that waste oil was not subject to the \npetroleum exclusion where there was expert evidence that waste oil was likely to contain metals, \nacids, post -refining additives , and other contaminants, but not where plaintiff “ made no showing ” \nthat soil was mixed with anything but petroleum.  Beede , 968 F. Supp. a t 461.  Here , putting aside \nthe argument in Plaintiffs’ opposition, they have not alleged the presence of contaminants that \nwould take this case out of the petroleum exclusion.  \nThe Court accordingly will dismiss the CERCLA and HSAA claims with leave to amend.  Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 6 of 16 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2. CERCLA Statute of Limitations  \nDefendants argue Dutch Girl’s CERCLA claim is barred by the statute of limitations, \nwhich requires that an action for cleanup costs be brought “within 6 years after initiation of \nphysical on -site construction of the remedial action .”  42 U.S.C. §  9613(g)(2)(B) .  The complaint \nalleges that, in 2007, Depper entered into a Right of Entry Agreement with Tesoro Resources to \n“install groundwater monitoring wells to monitor, maintain, sample, and collect water samples . . . \nto determine the scope of the contaminat ion and perform required remediation.”  ECF No. 1 ¶  47.  \nDutch Girl argues that, because the earlier excavations failed to fully resolve the problem, it was \nnot a “permanent” remedy and thus was a “removal action” or investigation —not a “remedial \naction” subject to the statute of limitations.  ECF No. 28 at 11.  This contention is contradicted by \nDutch Girl’s own complaint, which refers to the work done over the course of several years as \n“rem ediation.”  ECF No. 1 ¶¶  2, 6, 47, 49, 51 –53, 57.  The complaint also pleads that the Regional \nBoard closed the site in 2024, id. ¶¶ 55 n.7 —an indication that the measures taken “w[ere] \nintended to be a permanent remedy.”  Carson Harbor Vill., Ltd. v. Unocal Corp. , 287 F. Supp. 2d \n1118, 1158 (C.D. Cal. 2003) .  Accordingly, the Court finds that Dutch Girl has not stated a claim \nfor relief on its CERCLA claim because, on the face of the complaint, the claim falls outside the \nsix-year limitations period.     \n3. HSAA Statute of Limitations  \nThe parties agree a three -year statute of limitations applies to the HSAA claim.  ECF No. \n21 at 18; ECF No. 28 at 12; see Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §  338(b).  Plaintiffs acknowledge that they \n“incurred some  costs before February 2022 ” and in fact that they “learned of some  migration [of \npollutants] in 2007.”  ECF No. 28 at 12 (emphases in original).  But they argue that they relied on \na 2019 Indemnity Agreement in which Defendants “accepted responsibility . . . for the \ninvestigation and remediation” of the site and that Def endants failed to fulfill that agreement, and \nthus the discovery rule applies.  Id. at 12 –13.  Because the 2019 indemnity agreement is n ot \nproperly before the Court, see supra , the Court  will not consider this argument and  thus will \ndismiss Plaintiffs’ HSAA claim with leave to amend.   Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 7 of 16 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  B. Continuing Trespass and Continuing Nuisance   \n“[G]enerally the principles governing the permanent of continuing nature of a trespass or \nnuisance are the same.”   Starrh & Starrh Cotton Growers v. Aera Energy LLC , 153 Cal. App. 4th \n583, 594 (2007).  “[T]he key to whether a trespass is permanent . . . or continuing is whether the \ntrespass can be discontinued or abated at a reasonable cost. . . .  [T]here must be evidence that the \ntrespass is reasonably abatable even if the harm caused the trespass continues to interfere with the \npossessory interest of the  property owner .”  Id. at 594.  “Generally, whether a trespass is \ncontinuing or permanent is a question of fact properly submitted to the jury.”  Id. at 597.   \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs’ continuing trespass and continuing private nuisance \nclaims fail because “the alleged contamination at the Dutch Girl Property is not continuing.”  ECF \nNo. 21 at 18 –19.  For support, they cite only Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific \nTransportation Co. , 44 Cal. App. 4th 1160 (1996), arguing that, because the Beck  court relied in \npart on the fact that the Regional Board had determined “nothing further need be done” in \nreaching its conclusion that plaintiff had not proven  a continuing nuisance, id. at 1221 –22, the \nCourt ought to reach the same conclusion here , where the Regional Board issued a case closure .  \nBut Beck  was an appeal of a judgment entered after a full record was developed at trial, and the \nBeck  court underscored that “a too rigid distinction between permanent and continuing nuisances \nmay constitute a trap for the unwary plaintiff who guesses wrong,” and thus, “in doubtful cases the \nplaintiff has an election to treat a nuisance as permanent or co ntinuing.”  Id. at 1217.   \nSince Beck , “courts have consistently adhered to [the] rule that in a case in which the \ndistinction between permanent and continuing nuisance is close or doubtful the plaintiff will be \npermitted to elect  which theory to pursue.”  Capogeannis v. Super. Ct. , 12 Cal. App. 4th 668, 679 \n(1993) (emphasis in original); see id.  at 679 –80 (plaintiff could assert for the first time at summary \njudgment stage that the alleged nuisance was continuing and thus not subject to statute of \nlimitations).  Given the complicated history set forth in the complaint, including several allegedly  \nbotched attempts at remediation  and recurring issues at the site over the course of many years, the \nCourt finds that this is the kind of “close or doubtful” case that might constitute a continuing \ntrespass and continuing nuisance, depending on how the fac ts develop  over the course of the Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 8 of 16 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  lawsuit.  Accordingly, the Court declines to dismiss these claims at this early stage.   \nC. Public Nuisance  \n“A public nuisance is one which ‘affects at the same time an entire community or \nneighborhood, or any considerable number of persons.’”   People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna , 14 Cal. \n4th 1090, 1104 (1997) (quoting Cal. Civ. Code § 3480).  “A private individual may bring an action \nagainst a municipality to abate a public nuisance when the individual suffers harm that is .  . . \nspecially injurious to himself, but not otherwise.” Kempton v. City of Los Angeles , 165 Cal. App. \n4th 1344, 1349 (2008) (internal quotation m arks and citation omitted).   Defendants argue that \nPlaintiffs fail to plead that the alleged nuisance here affects an entire community or neighborhood  \nbecause Plaintiffs’ allegations about groundwater contamination are belied by the Regional \nBoard’s findings in its case closure  report .  ECF No. 21 at 20 –21.  Because th is argument relies \nupon a document the Court has declined to consider , see supra , the Court rejects th e argument.  \nD. Negligence  \nThe parties agree that Plaintiffs’ negligence claim is subject to a three -year statute of \nlimitations.  ECF No. 21 at 21; ECF No. 28 at 18; see Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §  338(b).   Defendants \nargue that the claim is time -barred because the complaint alleges that “Plaintiffs first learned about \nthe contamination” “[i]n or about 2007,” ECF No. 1 ¶  46, at least seven years before Plaintiffs \nfiled this action.  Plaintiff against responds by arguing that a 2019 indemnity agreement, the \nexistence of which is not pled in the complaint, mandates the invocation of the discovery rule here.  \nPlaintiffs thus “request the opportunity to amend” to add allegations regarding the agreement.  \nECF No. 28 at 18.  Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the negligence claim with leave to  amend.  \nE. Negligence Per Se  \n“Where a statutory standard establishes the defendant's duty, ‘proof of the defendant's \nviolation of a statutory standard of conduct raises a presumption of negligence that may be \nrebutted only by evidence establishing a justification or excuse for the statutory violation. ’”  \nSpates v. Dameron Hosp. Assn. , 114 Cal. App. 4th 208, 218, 7 Cal. Rptr. 3d 597, 606 (2003)  \n(quoting Ramirez v. Plough, Inc. , 6 Cal.4th 539, 547 (1993) ).  This rule is known as the doctrine \nof negligence per se.  Id.; see also Cal. Evid .Code § 669  (codifying doctrine) .  Under section 669:  Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 9 of 16 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   \nThe failure of a person to exercise due care is presumed if:  \n \n(1) He violated a statute, ordinance, or regulation of a public entity;  \n \n(2) The violation proximately caused death or injury to person or \nproperty;  \n \n(3) The death or injury resulted from an occurrence of the nature \nwhich the statute, ordinance, or regulation was designed to \nprevent; and  \n \n(4) The person suffering the death or the injury to his person or \nproperty was one of the class of persons for whose protection the \nstatute, ordinance, or regulation was adopted.  \nCal. Evid.  Code § 669(a).    \nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants violated state and federal statutes including California \nHealth and Safety Code sections 25189 and 25189.6 and California Water Code sections 13271 \nand 13304.  ECF No. 1 ¶  130.  Defendants argue that “Plaintiffs fail to explain how any individual \nDefendant’s conduct —or their conduct as a collective —satisfies the necessary elements of each \nstatute or even falls within the statutes’ scope.”  ECF No. 21 at 15 –16.    \nWhere a plaintiff pleads “only a bare allegation that all Defendants violated [several] \nstatutes” and “[t]he Court is left to guess who the activities of [the defendants] violated any of the \nstatutes,” the plaintiff fails to plead a viable negligence claim .  Coppola  v. Smith , 935 F. Supp. 2d \n993, 1032 –33 (E.D. Cal. Mar. 26, 2013).  Here, Plaintiffs only allege summarily that “Defendants’ \ncontinued failure to exercise reasonable care in controlling the release of hazardous substances and \nother contaminants v iolated numerous state and federal statutes, rules and regulations.”  ECF No. \n1 ¶ 130.   While Plaintiffs expand on their theory of how Defendants violated these statutes in their \nopposition, ECF No. 28 at 13 –15, “it is axiomatic that the complaint may not be amended by \nbriefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.”  Strome v. DBMK Enters., Inc. , No. C 14 -2398 SI, \n2014 WL 4437777, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 9, 2014) (quoting Barbera v. WMC Mortg. Corp. , C 04 -\n3638 SBA, 2008 WL 167632 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 19, 2006)).   \nThe Court will dismiss Plaintiffs’ negligence per se claim.  \nF. Equitable Indemnity  \n“[T]he elements of a cause of action for equitable indemnity are: (1) a showing of fault on Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 10 of 16 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the part of the indemnitor; and (2) resulting damages to the indemnitee for which the indemnitor is \ncontractually or equitably responsible.”  Star Indem. & Liab. Co. v. Peerless Ins. Co. , No. CV 15 -\n643-JFW (JCx), 2015 3843526, at *5 (C.D. Cal. June 22, 2025) (citing Gouvis Eng. v. Super. Ct. , \n37 Cal. App. Ct. 642, 646 (1995)).  The California Supreme Court “has consistently ruled that a \ncause of action for indemnity does not accrue until the indemnitee suffers loss through payment of \nan adverse judgment or settlement.”  (collecting cases).  City of San Diego v. U.S. Gypsum Co. , 30 \nCal. App. 4th 575, 587 (1994); see id.  at 588 (dismissing equitable indemnity claim where plaintiff \n“admitted . . . that no damages ‘to date’ arise from payment of third party claims or judgments”).  \nDefendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to plead a judgment or settlement that could establish \nan equitably indemnity claim.  Plaintiffs respond by arguing that such a claim “can be asserted \nprospectively once the indemnitee faces potential liability or incu rs costs due to the indemnitor’s \nactions.”  ECF No. 28 at 22.  But the cases Plaintiffs cite are inapposite.  See Valley Circle Estates \nv. VTN Consol., Inc. , 33 Cal. 3d 604, 612 (1983) (allowing prospective indemnity cross claim for \nsubcontractor under specific statutory provision providing for such a claim); Platt v. Coldwell \nBanker Res. Real Est. Servs. , 217 Ca l. App. 3d 1439,  1444 n.7 (1990)  (also discussing crossclaims \nfor indemnity).  The Court finds Plaintiffs have not pled the requisite “adverse judgment or \nsettlement” and thus will dismiss the equitable indemnity claim.   \nG. Express Indemnity  \nDefendants similarly argue that Plaintiffs’ express indemnity claim fails because Plaintiffs \ndo not allege “a current, binding obligation for contractual indemnity between Plaintiffs and any \nof the Defendants.”  ECF No. 21 at 26.  Plaintiffs first argue that the complaint alleges the \nexistence of three agreements  that include indemnity agreements,  ECF No. 1 ¶¶  47, 49, 143, and \nthat Tesoro Resources failed to perform its obligations under those agreements, including \nindemnification.  Id. ¶ 145.  But “[t]o properly plead breach of contract, ‘[t]he complaint must \nidentify the specific provisions of the contract allegedly breached by the defendant.’”  Caraccioli \nv. Facebook, Inc. , 167 F. Supp. 3d 1056, 1064 (N.D. Cal. 2016), aff’d , 700 F. App’x 588 (9th Cir. \n2017) (quoting Donohue v. Apple, Inc. , 871 F. Supp. 2d 913, 930 (N.D. Cal. 2012)).  Plaintiffs do \nnot provide the terms of the contract that they allege Defendants breached, and so the Court cannot Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 11 of 16 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  ascertain whether Plaintiffs have stated a claim.  See Langan v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n , 69 F. \nSupp. 3d 965, 979 –980 (N.D. Cal. 2014) (dismissing a complaint where the court could not \ndiscern what material obligation the defendant breached because the court did not know the terms \nof the contract) .   \nPlaintiffs also argue that the 2019 indemnity agreement provides a basis for their express \nindemnity claim.  ECF No. 28 at 23 –24.  As already discussed, supra , this agreement is not pled in \nthe complaint and thus the Court cannot consider it.  Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the \nexpress indemnity claim.   \nH. Declaratory Judgment  \nBecause declaratory relief is a remedy and not a cause of action, see Lane v. Vitek Real \nEstate Indus. Grp. , 713 F. Supp. 2d 1092, 1104 (E.D. Cal. 2010), when the underlying claims are \ndismissed, the declaratory relief cause of action must be dismissed as well.  Shaterian v. Wells \nFargo Bank, N.A. , 829 F. Supp. 2d 873, 888 (N.D. Cal. 2011).  Here, because the Court denies the \nmotion to dismiss as to Plaintiffs’ private nuisance, public nuisance, and trespass claims, it also \ndenies the request to dismiss Pla intiffs’ request for declaratory relief.  \nI. Injunctive Relief  \n“Injunctive relief is a remedy, not a cause of action .”  City of S. Pasadena v. Dep ’t of \nTransportation , 29 Cal. App. 4th 1280, 1293  (1994) .  Plaintiffs’ freestanding cause of action for \ninjunctive relief is dismissed without prejudice to their seeking that remedy in an amended \ncomplaint in connection with any cause of action that supports it.  Cf. Allen v. City of Sacramento , \n234 Cal. App. 4th 41, 65  (2015)  (“A cause of action must exist before a court may grant a request \nfor injunctive relief. ”).   \nJ. Proposition 65 Claim  \nWith respect to the Proposition 65 claim, Defendants argue that the one -year statute of \nlimitations has expired because Plaintiffs first learned about contamination on the property in 2007  \nand Plaintiffs sent the requisite Proposition 65 notice in 2018 , demonstrating that t hey were aware \nof the alleged contamination .  ECF No. 21 at 29 –30; Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §  340(a).  Defendants \nfurther argue that Plaintiffs only sent the notice to Marathon Petroleum and Tesoro Refining and Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 12 of 16 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  thus the claim fails as to the other defendants.  Id. \nPlaintiffs respond that the discovery rule applies  to toll the statute of lim itations.  ECF No. \n28 at 12 –13.  “The discovery rule, when applicable, mandates that accrual of a claim is postponed \nuntil the plaintiff discovers, or has reason to discover, the cause of action.”   Gerling Glob. \nReinsurance Corp. of Am. v. Fremont Gen. Corp. , No. 05-CV-05454 -CAS (PJWX ), 2007 WL \n9757934, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 10, 2007)  (citation and quotation omitted) , aff’d, 287 F. App ’x 3 \n(9th Cir. 2008) .  “A plaintiff ‘discovers ’ the claim when he or she at least suspects the factual \nbasis, as opposed to the legal theory,  of the claim, i.e., when he or she suspects an injury that was \ncaused by wrongdoing. ”  Id. (citation, quot ation, and ellipsis omitted).  Here, even assuming the \ndiscovery rule applies, it cannot assist Plainti ffs.  The complaint alleges discovery of the \nProposition 65 chemicals in indoor air in February 2023 —more than one year before Plaintiffs \nfiled this action.  ECF No. 28 at 25; ECF No. 1 ¶  55.  Plaintiffs ’ argument is also inconsistent with \ntheir contention that the 2018 notice letter provided the notice required b y Proposition 65 .  ECF \nNo. 28 at 26; Cal. Health & Safety Code §  25249.7(d)(1).  In other words, it is hard to reconcile \nthe fact that Plaintiffs sent a letter in 2018 stating  that Dutch Gi rl “intends to bring suit  . . . for, \namong other claims, violations of California  Health and Safety Code [sections] 25249.5 and \n25249.6 (also known as ‘Proposition 65 ’),” ECF No. 21 -5 at 2, with the argument that Plaintiffs \nlacke d sufficient information to bring suit  before 2025 .   \nWith regard to the adequacy of Plaintiffs ’ Proposition 65 notice, Plaintiffs contend, but do \nnot cite any authority to support, that “Defendants’ challenges to service or technical compliance \nare insufficient for dismissal.”1  Id.  In the absence of any authority suggesting otherwise, the \nCourt finds that: (1) the statute of limitations bars a Proposition 65 claim arising from the facts \nrecited in the 2018 notice; and (2) Plaintiffs have not pled that they provided the notice required \nby California Health and Safety Code section 25249.7(d)(1) for a Proposition 65 claim arising \nwithin the statute of limitations.  The Court will thus dismiss the claim.2 \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ opposition originally did cite a case that purported to support this argument, but that \ncase was later struck as part of Plaintiffs’ errata.  ECF No 31.  \n2 Plaintiffs also cite KFC W., Inc. v. Meghrig , 23 Cal. App. 4th 1167, 1180 –81 (1994)  for the \nproposition that “because pollutants continue to migrate onto  the Dutch Girl Property, such a Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 13 of 16 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  K. Equitable Tolling  \nEquitable tolling is a judicially created doctrine “designed to prevent unjust and technical \nforfeitures of the right to a trial on the merits when the purpose of the statute of limitations —\ntimely notice to the defendant of the plaintiff's claims —has been satisfied.”  Fanucci v. Allstate \nIns. Co. , 638 F. Supp. 2d 1125, 1137 (N.D. Cal. 2009) (quoting McDonald v. Antelope Valley \nCmty. Coll. Dist. , 45 Cal. 4th 88, 99 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  This doctrine can \n“suspend or extend a statute of  limitations as necessary to ensure fundamental practicality and \nfairness.”  Saint Francis Mem’l Hosp. v. State Dep’t of Pub. Health , 9 Cal. 5th 710, 719 (2020) \n(internal citations omitted) (quoting McDonald , 45 Cal.4th at 99).  \n“Federal courts must abide by a state’s tolling rules, which are integrally related to statutes \nof limitations.”  Albano , 634 F.3d at 530.  For equitable tolling to apply under California law, a \nplaintiff must establish: (1) timely notice to the defendant; (2) lack of prejudice to the defendant; \nand (3) reasonable and good faith conduct on the part of the plaintiff.  McDonald , 45 Cal. 4th at \n102.  Finally, because the applicability of equitable tolling often relates to matters outside of a \ncomplaint, it is not “generally amenable to resolution on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.”  Supermail  \nCargo, Inc. v. United States , 68 F. 3d 1204,  1206  n.2 (9th Cir. 1995)  (citing Cervantes v. City of \nSan Diego , F.3d 1273, 1276 (9th Cir.1993)).  A complaint cannot be dismissed on a Rule 12(b)(6) \nmotion “unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would \nestablish the timeliness of the claim.”   Id. at 1207.  \nDefendants argue that the complaint (1) fails to allege which claims are subject to equitable \ntolling and why, and (2) belies Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding equitable tolling because it alleges \nregular communication between Plaintiffs and Defendants reg arding the contamination at the gas \nstation site since 2000 and that Plaintiffs have known about potential migration onto their property \nsince 2007.  ECF No. 21 at 31 –32.    \nThe complaint alleges that “equitable tolling of the statute of limitations applies” because \n \ncondition gives rise to new (and continuing) violations of  Proposition 65 that . . . defeat statutes of \nlimitations defenses .”  ECF No. 28 at 26.  KFC does not address Proposition 65 claims and is not \nhelpful to Plaintiffs.   Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 14 of 16 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Defendants “failed to take adequate and effective steps to address” contamination on the Dutch \nGirl property , “concealed and omitted relevant facts that would have allowed Plaintiffs to discover \nthe true nature and degree of the soil and groundwater contamination issues ,” and “actively \nmislead Plaintiffs through affirmative representations and omission with respect to the true nature, \nquality, and hazards of the contamination.”   ECF No. 1 ¶  57.  The Court agrees that these \nallegations are too vague and general to support equitable tolling.  See, e.g. , Biotech. Value Fund, \nL.P. v. Celera Corp. , 12 F. Supp. 3d 1194, 1206 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (complaint alleging equitable \ntolling “due to the surreptitious nature of defendants’ misconduct, which defendant concealed \nfrom plaintiffs and other investors throughout the relevant period” was insufficient).  It is true that \nthe complaint sets forth a lengthy and complicated history of interactions between Plaintiffs and \nDefendants, and prom ises by Defendants to investigate , monitor,  and remediate migration of \npollutants onto the Dutch Girl property , and u nder these circumstances, it is conceivable  that \nPlaintiffs “could not have discovered the alleged violations by exercising reasonable diligence,” \nand that Defendants in the meantime had notice of the facts giving rise to Plaintiffs’ eventual \nclaims.  Rosenfeld v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. , 732 F. Supp. 2d 952, 964 (N.D. Cal. 2010).  \nBut the Court finds that, as currently pled, Plaintiffs fa il to “nudge[]” their equitable tolling \nallegations across the line from conceivable to plausible.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 547.   \nL. Punitive Damages  \nUnder California’s damage statute, a corporate employer is liable for punitive damages \n“based upon acts of an employee” only if:  \n \nthe employer had advance knowledge of the unfitness of the employee \nand employed him or her with a conscious disregard of the rights or \nsafety of others or authorized or ratified the wrongful conduct for \nwhich the damages are awarded or was personally guil ty of \noppression, fraud, or malice.  With respect to a corporate employer, \nthe advance knowledge and conscious disregard, authorization, \nratification or act of oppression, fraud, or malice must be on the part  \nof an officer, director, or managing agent of the corporation.  \n \nCal. Civ. Code §  3294(b).  “[T]he punitive damage statute requires proof of malice among \ncorporate leaders: the ‘officer[s], director[s], or managing agent[s].’”  Cruz v. Homebase , 83 Cal. \nApp. 4th 160, 167 (2000) (quoting Cal. Civ. Code §  3294(b)).  But w hile the Court applies Case 4:25-cv-01390-JST     Document 38     Filed 10/06/25     Page 15 of 16 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  California substantive law to a claim for punitive damages, “the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \ngovern the punitive damages claim procedurally with respect to the adequacy of the pleadings.”  \nTerpin v. AT&T Mobility LLC , 118 F.4th 1102, 1112 (9th Ci r. 2024).  “In federal court, a plaintiff \nmay include a ‘short and plain’ prayer for punitive damages that relies entirely on unsupported and \nconclusory averments of malice or fraudulent intent.”  Clark v. Allstate Ins. Co. , 105 F. Supp. 2d \n1016, 1019 (S.D. Cal. July 27, 2000).   \nHere, however, Plaintiffs do not even make the requisite “conclusory averments” of \noppression, malice, or fraud.  In fact, the complaint’s only mention of punitive damages comes in \nthe prayer for relief, where Plaintiffs request a judgment “[f]or punitive damages and exemplary \ndamages against all Defendants.”  ECF No. 1 at 32.  This fails to satisfy even the low bar \nnecessary to plead a plausible entitlement to punitive damages and consequently will dismiss the \nrequest for punitive damages.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Courts grants the motion in part and dismisses Plaintiffs’ \nclaims for CERCLA  violations , HSAA  violations , negligence, negligence per se, equitable \nindemnity, express indemnity, Proposition 65  violations , and punitive damages .  The Court denies \nthe motion as to Plaintiffs’ claims for continuing trespass, continuing private nuisance, continuing \npublic nuisance, declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief.       \nThe Court grants leave to amend.  Plaintiffs may file an amended complaint within 28 days \nsolely to correct the deficiencies identified in this order.  \nThe case management confer ence s chedul ed for October 7, 2025 is contin ued to Decemb er \n9, 2025 at 2:00 p.m.  An updated joint case management statement is due Dec ember 2, 2025 .   \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   October 6, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nJON S.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Ismael Martinez sued Foremost Insurance claiming inadequate compensation for hail and wind damage to his property, totaling $122,971.17, against which Foremost only paid $3,178.41. The court granted Foremost's motion for partial summary judgment on Martinez's bad-faith claim, as Martinez failed to demonstrate that Foremost lacked a reasonable basis for its insurance payment, which was based on the Actual Cash Value of the damages and Foremost's reliance on an engineering report. This case does not involve AI, ML, or automated systems directly in its facts or claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether Foremost Insurance breached its contract and acted in bad faith by undercompensating Martinez for property damages under their insurance policy.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted summary judgment in favor of Foremost on the bad-faith claim, finding no evidence of bad faith in Foremost's payment decision. However, the court did not grant summary judgment on the breach of contract claim, as Foremost's motion did not provide sufficient basis for such relief, leaving that aspect of the case unresolved.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Ismael Martinez's house was damaged, and he thought his insurance should pay him more to fix it. The insurance company, Foremost, said they paid the right amount based on their calculations and expert advice. The judge agreed that the insurance company didn't do anything wrong on purpose (bad faith) but didn't make a decision yet about whether the insurance deal they made with Ismael was followed correctly (breach of contract). The judge also told Ismael to explain why he hasn’t been following court rules or else the rest of his case might be dismissed.",
    "full_text": "IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA  \n \nISMAEL MARTINEZ,  \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \n v.  \n \nFOREMOST INSURANCE COMPANY ,  \n \nDefendant.   \n \n8:24CV15  \n \n \nMEMORANDUM  \nAND ORDER  \n  \nPlaintiff Ismael Martinez (“Martinez”) brought this lawsuit (Filing No. 1-1) against \ndefendant Foremost Insurance Company (“Foremost”) in the District Court of Douglas \nCounty, Nebraska, on December 4, 2023.  Martinez alleges that his home in Omaha, \nNebraska (the “property”), was severely damaged by hail and wind on August 7, 2021.  Despite purportedly being covered by an insurance policy issued by Foremost (the \n“policy”), Martinez reports the company has only paid $3,178.41 of his $122,971.17 in \ntotal losses incurred from the property damage.   His complaint asserts claims for breach of \ncontract and bad faith under Nebraska law .  See Neb. Rev. Stat. § 44- 1540.  \nOn January 16, 2024, Foremost removed the case to this Court (Filing No. 1) on the \nbasis of complete diversity between the parties.  See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1332(a), 1441(b).  It \nanswered (Filing No. 2) the complaint that same day.  The parties engaged in discovery for \nthe next year or so.  \nNow before the Court is Foremost’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (Filing \nNo. 15).  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  Foremost seeks an order granting partial summary \njudgment on all of Martinez’s claims that “seek[] coverage in excess of Actual Cash Value” \nas defined in the policy.  It relatedly asserts it is entitled to summary judgment on Martinez’s bad- faith claim because it issued payment “on an Actual Cash Value basis” and \ntherefore had a “good faith basis” in making its determinations .  In support, Foremost has 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 1 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>2 \n submitted a brief (Filing No. 16) containing its legal argument and statement of undisputed \nfacts and an index of exhibits (Filing No. 17).1 \nThree months have passed, and Martinez has failed to respond in any way to \nForemost’s motion.  See NECivR 7.1(b)(1)(B) (giving an opposing party 21 days to \nrespond to a motion for summary judgment), 56.1(b)(3) (same).  On April 9, 2025, Martinez’s attorneys moved to withdraw from the case (Filing No. 19), citing his repeated failure “to timely and fully respond to communications.”  See NEGenR 1.3(f).  The last \ntime they heard from Martinez was January 11, 2024.   \nThe magistrate judge granted their motion to withdraw on April 10.  In his Order \n(Filing No. 20), the magistrate judge told Martinez that he could retain substitute counsel but would be “deemed to be proceeding pro se ” upon submission of proof of service of the \nOrder.  He also informed Martinez that he was responsible for keeping the Court informed of his contact information and complying with the progression deadlines, rules, and orders \nof the Court.  Finally, the magistrate judge extended the deadline for him to file a response \nto Foremost’s pending motion and warned him “that failure to file a” timely response would \npreclude him “‘from contesting [Foremost’s] statement of facts.’”  See NECivR \n7.1(b)(1)(C). \nMartinez’s former counsel filed a Notice of Service (Filing No. 21) reporting that \nthey sent notice of the magistrate judge’s Order to Martinez by mail on April 15.  Still, the Court has not heard from Martinez .  Having given him more than ample time to respond, \nthe Court now addresses Foremost’s unopposed Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. \n \n1Those submissions fail to comply with the local rules in multiple respects.  See \nNECivR 7.1(d)(4) (requiring briefs be accompanied by certificates of compliance with the \nCourt’s rules on word limits and generative artificial intelligence), 56.1(a)(3) (“The \nstatement of material facts must describe the parties and recite all facts supporting the \ncourt’ s venue and jurisdiction. The statement must not contain legal conclusions.”), (4) \n(“The statement of material facts shall be filed in a separate document from the motion for summary judgment and brief in support of the motion.”). 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 2 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>3 \n I. BACKGROUND  \nThe facts available to the Court on this motion are sparse.  They are derived in part \nfrom Foremost’s curt Statement of Undisputed Facts, which provides a less than full picture \nof the circumstances underlying the parties’ dispute.  For purposes of this motion, those \nfacts that are properly supported by citations to the record are deemed undisputed given \nMartinez’s failure to respond to them in any way.  See NECivR 7.1(b)(1)(C) (“Failure to \nfile an opposing brief . . . precludes the opposing party from contesting the moving party’ s \nstatement of facts.”).  \nForemost is an insurance company based in Michigan.  In 2021, it issued a policy \n(Filing No. 17- 3) to Martinez for the property.  The policy’s coverage began on May 4, \n2021, and ended on May 4, 2022.  Under the terms of the policy, if a “total loss” of the \nproperty were to occur —which is defined as an event rendering the “dwelling [] damaged \nbeyond reasonable repair”—the covered “loss [would] be equal to the Amount of \nInsurance” on the Declarations Page.  For Martinez’s property , that amount was $102,549 \n(the “Amount of Insurance”).  \nThe policy also provided payment methods for damages  resulting in partial losses \nto the dwelling and losses to the property’s roof.  Under the “Scheduled Roof Payment \nMethod,” Foremost agreed to pay the lowest of (1) “[t]he scheduled roof payment,” \n(2) “[t]he amount required to repair or replace the damaged component parts of [the] roof \nmaterials,” or (3) the Amount of Insurance.  The policy further defines the “scheduled roof \npayment” as “all the estimated reasonable costs to repair or replace insured loss of or damage to any roof materials multiplied by the scheduled roof payment percentage” listed in a chart attached to the policy.   \nIn the event of partial losses  to the dwelling, the policy limited  coverage to an \n“Actual Cash Value Payment Method.”  In that case, Foremost would only pay “the lowest \nof” (1) “[t]he actual cash value of the lost or damaged component parts of [the] dwelling 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 3 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>4 \n at the time of the loss,” (2) “[t]he amount required to repair or replace the lost or damaged \ncomponent parts of [the] dwelling,” or (3) the Amount of Insurance.  \n“Actual cash value” is defined as “the amount it would cost to repair or replace \ninsured property with new property of like kind and quality , less allowance for physical \ndeterioration, depreciation, and obsolescence.”   By the policy’s terms, it does not include \n“amounts for contractor’s fees or charges for overhead and profit” unless those fees and charges “are reasonable and incurred.”  For purposes of “loss to roof materials, the \nscheduled roof payment is deemed to be and will determine the actual cash value of the \nloss.”  \nMartinez’s complaint alleges his property “suffered severe hail and wind damage on \nAugust 7, 2021,” at which time it “was valued at $100,100.00 by the Douglas County \nAssessor’s Office.”  He asserts he has incurred $122,971.17 in damages from the “total \nloss” of his property.  His allegations provide no other details of the nature of those \ndamages, and —given his failure to respond —there is little else the Court has to go off in \nterms of how he believes his property was impacted.  \nFor its part, Foremost states it relied on an October 3, 2022, report by Donan \nEngineering (Filing No. 17-5) in assessing the damage to the property.  That report \ndescribes Donan Engineering’s observations from a September 22, 2022, site-visit to the \nproperty.  In addition to its engineers, Martinez’s spouse  and a public adjuster were present \nduring the inspection.  The engineers took photographs and attached them to the report.  \nDonan Engineering concluded that “hail up to 1 inch in diameter [had] fallen” at the \nsite of the property , causing damage to the roof shingles.  It also found that a couple of \nshingles were “torn in a manner consistent with strong winds.”  It disagreed, however, with \nMartinez’s claim that the hail damage caused water intrusion resulting in damage to the interior of the property.  In Donan Engineering’s opinion, that water damage was “the result 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 4 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>5 \n of the gap in the roof’s chimney flashing” which had been developing for years.  It also \nconcluded the property’s siding was not damaged by the hail.  \nIn its October 19, 2022, estimate (Filing No. 17-4), Foremost stated it evaluated  the \nproperty’s damage “based upon the findings of Donan Engineering,” and made an estimate based on “the Actual Cash Value of [his] claim.”  Much of the estimated damages arose from the property’s roof.  Foremost applied a 46.6% depreciation rate to the cost of roof repairs, greatly diminishing the “Replacement Cost Value” of $11,559.25.  In total, the Actual Cash Value of the claim was calculated at $6,436.44.  After deducting a previous \n$2,258.03 payment and Martinez’s $1,000 deductible, Foremost decided it owed him only \n$3,178.41.  \nForemost avers it “has paid all money due and payable under” the policy.  It further \nasserts that it “had a good faith basis in reaching its determinations” on Martinez’s claim \nbecause it relied on Donan Engineering ’s report and its  own estimate in concluding what \ncovered losses Martinez incurred.   On those bases, it argues partial summary judgment is \nwarranted.  \nII. DISCUSSION  \n A. Standard of Review  \nUnder Rule 56(a), a party may move for summary judgment “as to an entire case[,] \n. . . claim,  defense, or part of a claim or defense.”  Fed R. Civ. P. 56 Advisory Committee \nNotes, 2010 Amendment; see also Hotel 71 Mezz Lender LLC v. Nat’l Retirement Fund, \n778 F.3d 593, 606 (7th Cir. 2015) (explaining  “[n]othing in Rule 56 demands an all-or -\nnothing approach” and that “a party may seek summary judgment as to a limited portion \nof its case”).  “Summary judgment is [required] ‘if the movant shows that there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter \nof law.’”  Whittington v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 21 F.4th 997, 1000 (8th Cir. 2021) (quoting \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)).   8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 5 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>6 \n “The movant bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the \nbasis for its motion and must identify the portions of the record that it believes demonstrate \nthe absence of a genuine dispute of material fact.”  Bedford v. Doe, 880 F.3d 993, 996 (8th Cir. 2018); see also Torgerson v. City of Rochester, 643 F.3d 1031, 1042 (8th Cir. 2011) (en \nbanc).  It “can satisfy its burden in either of two ways: it can produce evidence negating an \nessential element of the nonmoving party’ s case, or it can show that the nonmoving party \ndoes not have enough evidence of an essential element of its claim to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.”  Bedford, 880 F.3d at 996; accord Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, \n477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986).   \nIf the movant makes this showing, the nonmovant must submit evidence “of specific \nfacts showing the presence of a genuine issue for trial” to prevent summary judgment.  Bedford, 880 F.3d at 997.  A genuine issue for trial exists when the nonmovant “present[s] enough evidence that a jury could reasonably find in his favor.”  Id.; see also Torgerson, \n643 F.3d at 1052 (explaining the fact in dispute must be “material to the outcome of the case” to preclude summary judgment).   \n B. Analysis\n2 \nForemost first asks the Court to “declar[e] that [Martinez] is only entitled to \npayment from Foremost for Actual Cash Value[ ] and for such other and further relief as \nthe Court deems just and equitable.”  Its motion fails to justify such relief. \n“An insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the insured, whose \nrespective rights and obligations must be determined by contract principles.”  Rose v. Am. \nFamily Ins., 995 N.W.2d 650, 653 (Neb. 2023).  Under Nebraska law, “[t]he interpretation \nof a contract and whether the contract is ambiguous are questions of law .”  Avis Rent A Car \nSys., Inc. v. McDavid, 984 N.W.2d 632, 635 (Neb. 2023).   A contract “must be construed \n \n2Foremost applies Nebraska law in its argument for summary judgment.  Given that, \nand the lack of any indication that some other law governs Martinez’s claims, the Court \nfollows suit.   8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 6 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>7 \n . . . to give effect to the parties’ intentions. ”  Rose, 995 N.W.2d at 653.   When its terms “are \nclear, a court may not resort to rules of construction, and the terms are accorded their plain \nand ordinary meaning as an ordinary or reasonable person would understand them.”  Seemann v. Seemann, 18 N.W.3d 118, 126 (Neb. 2025).  \nThe only fact statement Foremost provides to support its request for partial summary \njudgment on Martinez’s breach-of-contract claim is the following: “ The Policy provides \ncoverage on an Actual Cash Value only  [sic].”   It’s not entirely clear what that means.  As \nwritten, that statement seems to be a legal conclusion regarding the general scope of the \npolicy’s coverage  that may not entirely accord with the terms of the policy itself.  At least \nin cases of total loss, the payment owed under the policy is not  limited to an Actual Cash \nValue of repairs but is equal to the policy’s Amount of Insurance —$102,549.   \nWhile it seems improbable that the property suffered a total loss, Foremost’s \nbarebones brief and statement of facts provide little to no factual context for the Court to be certain that Martinez’s claim only  entitled him to  payment based on the Actual Cash  \nValue of the loss.  See Johnson v. Charps Welding & Fabricating, Inc., 950 F.3d 510, 524 \n(8th Cir. 2020) (explaining courts “will not mine a summary judgment record” for facts to “gild a party’s arguments” (quoting Rodgers v. City of Des Moines, 435 F.3d 904, 908 (8th Cir. 2006))).  Simply put, Foremost has failed to meet its burden to justify the entry of \nsummary judgment on this limited record.  See Spann v. Lombardi, 960 F.3d 1085, 1088 \n(8th Cir. 2020) (explaining that “a district court does not abuse its discretion by declining to address an argument for summary judgment that is not properly briefed”); Loc. No. 499, \nBd. of Trs. of Shopmen’s Pension Plan v. Art Iron, Inc., 117 F.4th 923,  933 (6th Cir. 2024) \n(“The movant ‘always bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue as \nto a material fact’  and bears this burden ‘regardless if an adverse party fails to respond.’” \n(quoting Carver v. Bunch, 946 F.2d 451, 455 (6th Cir. 1991))).  \nForemost fares better with respect to Martinez’s bad-faith claim.  To establish a \nclaim for bad faith under Nebraska law, Martinez “must show the absence of a reasonable 8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 7 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>8 \n basis for denying benefits of the insurance policy and the defendant’ s knowledge or \nreckless disregard of the lack of a reasonable basis for denying the claim.”  Merrick v. \nFischer, Rounds & Assocs., 939 N.W.2d 795, 807 (Neb. 2020); accord Hayes v. Metro. \nProp. & Cas. Ins., 908 F.3d 370, 374 (8th Cir. 2018).  Based on Foremost’s statement of \nfacts, it is undisputed for purposes of this motion that “Foremost had a good faith basis in \nreaching its determinations as to the amount of covered payable loss” on Martinez’s claim \ndue to its reliance on Donan Engineering’s report and the estimate completed by its agent.  Without a response from Martinez demonstrating a genuine factual dispute, that dissipates \nany claim that Foremost had “no reasonable basis for denying” any part of his  claim.  \nHayes, 908 F.3d at 374.  Even if their calculations and payments somehow missed the mark, \nthere is no evidence that they were made in bad faith.  See Braesch v. Union Ins., 464 \nN.W.2d 769, 777-78 (Neb. 1991) (explaining a claim for bad faith only arises from intentional or reckless conduct, not mere negligence).  \nFor those reasons, the Court concludes summary judgment is appropriate as to \nMartinez’s bad-faith claim but not his breach- of-contract claim.  Because of his apparent \nfailure to participate in this litigation in any meaningful way over the past several months \ndespite the Court’s notices and warnings, Martinez is ordered to show cause why the \nremainder of his complaint should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute.  See Fed. R. \nCiv. P . 41(b); NECivR 41.2 (“ At any time, after appropriate notice, a case not being \nprosecuted with reasonable diligence may be dismissed for lack of prosecution.”); Ackra \nDirect Marketing Corp. v. Fingerhut Corp., 86 F.3d 852, 856-57 (8th Cir. 1996) (“[P]ro se  \nrepresentation does not excuse a party from complying with a court’ s orders and with the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.”).  His failure to timely comply with that order may result \nin the dismissal of this case without further notice.  Accordingly,  \nIT IS ORDERED:  \n1. Defendant Foremost Insurance Company’s Motion for Partial Summary \nJudgment (Filing No. 15) is granted in part and denied in part.  8:24-cv-00015-RFR-MDN     Doc # 22     Filed: 07/07/25     Page 8 of 9 - Page ID #\n<pageID>9 \n 2. Plaintiff Ismael Martinez’s bad-faith claim (Filing No. 1-1) is dismissed with \nprejudice.  Foremost’s request for partial summary judgment is denied in all \nother respects.  \n3. On or before July 25, 2025, Martinez must show cause why the rest of his complaint should not be dismissed for failure to diligently prosecute this \ncase.  \n  \n Dated this 7th day of July 2025.  \n \nBY THE COURT:  \n \n \n \nRobert F.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The court denied Linwei Ding's motion to dismiss charges of stealing trade secrets to benefit a foreign government, specifically the People's Republic of China (PRC). The prosecution argued that Ding's AI company activities, aligning with PRC policies, indicated intent to benefit the PRC, while the court emphasized that the statute requires intent or knowledge of benefitting a foreign government without mandating direct evidence or participation of any foreign government.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether the indictment sufficiently alleges that Ding intended to benefit the PRC through the theft of trade secrets, as required under 18 U.S.C. § 1831, even without direct evidence of coordination with the PRC government.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that the indictment sufficiently alleged Ding's intent to benefit the PRC, as required by § 1831, through his AI company’s dealings with PRC entities. Thus, the motion to dismiss the charges was denied, allowing the case to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** In this case, a guy named Ding was accused of taking secret business information to help China. The law doesn't need proof that China asked for this help, just that Ding intended for China to benefit. The court said there’s enough reason to believe Ding might have intended to help China, so the case will continue in court.",
    "full_text": " \n \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA  \n \nUSA , \nPlaintiff , \nv. \n \nLINWEI DING , \nDefendant . \n Case No.   24-cr-00141 -VC-1    \n \n \nORDER DENYING MOTION TO \nDISMISS AND MOTION FOR BILL \nOF PARTICULARS  \nRe: Dkt. Nos. 54, 63  \n \n \nThe motion to dismiss is denied.  \nFirst, there is no requirement in section 1831 that the foreign government have sponsored \nor coordinated the trade secret theft. The inclusion of the word “espionage” in section 1831’s \ntitle does not change the fact that the text requires no such government inter action. See also \nUnited States v. Chung , 659 F.3d 815, 828 (9th Cir. 2011)  (noting that a conviction under section \n1831 does not “ require [] evidence of a foreign government ’s direction or control ” but instead can \nrest solely on the defendant’s intent to benefit a foreign government).  \nSecond , Ding’s argument that the word “benefit” as used in section 1831 must mean \ndisclosure of the stolen trade secret is not supported by the text. As an initial matter, the statute \nonly speaks of an intent or knowledge that the trade secret theft will benefit the foreign \ngovernment, with no textual guardrails on the definition of “benefit.” The legislative history \nsupports a broader reading of “benef it,” noting that a benefit could also be reputational, strategic, \nor tactical.  H.R. R ep. 104 -788 at 11 (1996) (“ Rather, the government need only prove that the \nactor intended that his actions in copying or otherwi se controlling the trade secret would benefit \nthe foreign government, instrumentality, or agent in any way. Therefore, in this circumstance, Case 3:24-cr-00141-VC     Document 105     Filed 06/11/25     Page 1 of 3 \n2 benefit means not only an economic benefit but also reputational, strategic, or tactical benefit. ”). \nThis is  especially  apparent when comparing section 1832, which requires proof of an intent to \n“economically benefit,” with section 1831, which only requires intent or knowledge that the \ntrade secret theft will “benefit” a foreign government. Compare 18 U.S.C. §  1831(a) (“ Whoever, \nintending or knowing that the offense will benefit  any foreign government  . . .” (emphasis \nadded)) with id. § 1832(a) (“ Whoever, w ith intent to convert a trade secret,  . . . to the economic \nbenefit  of anyone other than the owner thereof  . . .” (emphasis added)).  \nDing’s next argument, that the indictment does not sufficiently allege Ding’s intent or \nknowledge to benefit the P eople’s Republic of China (PRC) , also fails. The government has three \nprimary theories for proof of Ding’s intent or knowledge to benefit the PRC : (1) in his marketing \nmaterials for his artificial intelligence (AI)  company, Ding circulated a PowerPoint citing PRC \nnational policies encouraging the development of domestic AI, (2)  Ding applied to a PRC talent \nprogram, programs that  are typically sponsored by the PRC to encourage companies to move  to \nthe PRC and  through which the PRC  pays for research, labs, etc. to incentivize th at move, and \n(3) an internal memo  for Ding’s company  noted that the  company  was marketing  to and in \ncommunications with public universities and municipal governments for those entities to engage \nthe company’s services. Superseding Indictment ¶¶  24–26. Certainly the third  theory , which  \nalleges Ding’s i ntent to directly provide a service to a government entity, would satisfy section \n1831 , so the motion to dismiss must be denied .  \nThe Court is somewhat skeptical of the government’s first two theories. The idea, \napparently, is that Ding knew about the PRC’s  AI initiatives and intended to benefit the PRC by \nfilling the gap identified by the PRC  and so help the PRC achieve its domestic AI goals . The idea \nthat Ding actually intended to benefit the PRC, as opposed to benefiting himself through an \nopportunity PRC was providing, seems dub ious. And at times, it seems as if  the government is \nreading  out of section 1831 the word “government” and is asking the Court to apply the statute to \nanyone who intends or knows that the trade secret theft  will benefit a foreign country . For \nexample, the government argues that  an actor who steals a trade secret and creates a company to Case 3:24-cr-00141-VC     Document 105     Filed 06/11/25     Page 2 of 3 \n3 \ntake advantage of a favorable regulatory environment, knowing that a foreign government has \ncreated a favorable regulatory environment, would face liability under section 1831. But in that \ncase, it’s not clear that the actor intends or knows that taking advantage of this favorable \nenvironment will benefit  a foreign government , based solely on the actor’s knowledge  that a \nfavorable regulatory environment has been  created by that foreign government. The first two \ntheories will only work if the government proves that Ding intended or knew that his trade secret \ntheft would benefit the PRC —not solely China as a country or Ding’s own economic interests .  \nFor similar reasons , and as discussed at the hearing , Ding’s motion for a bill of \nparticulars is denied. While the indictment does not list the specific government actors to which  \nDing’s company is alleged to have marketed its services, the government has provided the \ncompany memo listing those entities. And while Ding argues that the government has not alleged \na link between Ding’s trade secret theft and the use of the trade secre ts at Ding’s AI company, \nthe government does allege that Ding stole the trade  secrets and intended that theft to benefit the \nPRC through  the creation and services  of Ding’s company . That is sufficient to put Ding on \nnotice of the theories of liability the government intends to present at trial.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  June 9, 2025  \n______________________________________  \nVINCE CHHABRIA  \nUnited States District Judge  \n Case 3:24-cr-00141-VC     Document 105     Filed 06/11/25     Page 3 of 3",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court case involves challenges to Georgia's current statewide electronic voting system, focusing on its cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the alleged burden it places on the constitutional rights of voters under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Plaintiffs argue that both the previous Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting system and the current Dominion Ballot Marking Device (BMD) system are compromised, citing evidence such as expert testimony and incidents like the Coffee County election system breach, which highlight potential security risks. AI or automated systems are implicated through the design and function of electronic voting machines, software, and pollbooks, all of which are critical in counting votes and maintaining voter information.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The central legal issue is whether Georgia's electronic voting system, as implemented, has sufficient cybersecurity deficiencies to amount to a constitutional violation of voters' rights to cast effective votes that are accurately counted.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court found that there are material factual disputes, precluding the grant of summary judgment in favor of the State Defendants regarding the primary claims against the current electronic voting system (BMD). However, the court granted summary judgment for the State regarding claims related to the obsolete DRE system and granted summary judgment to Fulton County due to its lack of authority on the disputed voting system matters. The case will proceed to trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Think of Georgia's electronic voting system like a big computer being challenged because people are worried it can be hacked easily. The plaintiffs—people suing about the voting system—say the current way votes are counted and stored by these machines can make mistakes or be tampered with, which isn’t fair for voters. The court decided there is enough concern and evidence of these issues to have a trial to figure this out. However, any changes to the law, like switching to a paper voting system, are up to state lawmakers, not the court. The trial will figure out if the current system really is a problem, potentially affecting how votes are counted in future elections.",

Cf. Jacobson v. Fla. Sec ’y of \nState , 974 F.3d 1236 (11 th Cir. 2020) ; Wood v. Raffensperger , 981 F.3d 1307 (11 th \nCir. 2020).  Instead, this case focuses on whether  Georgia’s statewide electronic \nvoting system ,1 as currently designed and implemented , suffers from major \n \n1 The State’s election system equipment is uni formly used throughout Georgia for in -person voting \nin all elections , except when a select number of jurisdictions hold elections for a small number of \n Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 1 of 1352 cybersecurity  deficiencies that unconstitutionally burden Plaintiffs ’ First and \nFourteenth Amendment right s and capacity to case effective  votes that are \naccurately counted .2 \nSince its inception, this electio n case has gone through multiple stages of \nevolution. Plaintiffs have raised challenges to both the original, critically outdated \nDirect Recording Electronic (“DRE”) voting system and the current Dominion \nBallot Marking Device (“BMD”) sy stem that replaced the DRE system several years \ninto the case, starting in 2020. A plethora of new factual and legal developments \nemerged along the way, topped off by the breach of the Coffee County election \nsystem in early 2021. This breach and the copyin g and sharing of election system \nsoftware and voting data to actors and entities inside and outside of the state, as \nwell as through  the internet, bear serious ramifications for the future vulnerability \nof the State’s election system as a whole. Plaintiffs  initially discovered this breach \nin 2021 and, thereafter in 2022, conducted a series of depositions of individuals \ninvolved in the breach, some of whom were indicted in the pending RICO criminal \ncase in Fulton  County Superior Court . See Georgia v. Trump et al. , 23SC188947 \n(Fulton Cty. Super. Ct. Aug. 14, 2023) .  \n \nlocal offices in off election cycle years. O.C.G.A. § 21 -2-300. Absentee ballots are processed and \ntallie d on county electronic scanners, which are also provided by the State.  \n2  The Court notes that the record  evidence does not suggest that the Plaintiffs are conspiracy \ntheorists of any variety.  Indeed , some of the nation’s leading cybersecurity experts and computer \nscientists have provided testimony and affidavits on behalf of Plaintiffs’ case in the long course of \nthis litigation.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 2 of 1353 This case’s broad evidentiary scope can be daunting. To assist the reader’s \nreview of the Order, the Court has started by first providing a cast of many of the \nkey individuals  and experts who , in the last few years , have played a role in this \ncase as well as a glossary of specialized terms and abbreviations. The Court then \nproceeds to provide information necessary to give context for a range of relevant \ntopics, including, among others:  \n• the use of computerized electronic voting  systems  in Georgia and \nthe history of the cybersecurity and voting issues raised by \nPlaintiffs in their series of legal challenges, as previously addressed \nby this Court;  \n \n• the cybersecurity and reliability issues surrounding the use of the \nrelevant electronic voting systems and the auditin g of such systems \nand voting results;  \n \n• the cybersecurity experts’ evaluations and testimony regarding the \nState’s voting systems and exposure to breach es, especially in the \nabsence of timely, needed software patches and the \nimplementation of other cybersecu rity protective measures;  \n \n• the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity & \nInfrastructure Agency ’s (“CISA”) review of the Dominion \nImageCast X system and software (currently used in Georgia) and \nCISA ’s issuance of a national advisory notice on June 3, 20 22 \nrecommending that jurisdictions using this particular Dominion \nsoftware and related technology implement specific measures  to \nlimit unauthorized access or manipulation of voting systems;  \n \n• the serious security issues and long -term ramificati ons \nsurrounding the breach of the Coffee County election system and \nunauthorized access to the State Dominion voting software and \nelection data, and the resulting impact on future voting security;3 \n \n \n3 Issues regarding the State Defendants’ delayed and incomplete review of the Coffee Co unty \nbreach are addressed in Section IV.E.4.f of this Order.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 3 of 1354 • Defendants’ principal defense that Plaintiffs lack standing to assert \nthe constitutional claims raised in this case and, on the other side, \nthe grounds Plaintiffs rely on to establish their legal standing to \npursue their claims in this case — grounds inc luding the alleged \nsevere burden placed on their capacity to cast an effective and \nreliable vote by Defendants’ handling of the election system;  \n \n• The Court’s legal and evidentiary analysis of the issues in dispute \nraised by the Defendants’ pending Mot ions for Summary \nJudgment.  \n \nAs these evidentiary and legal issues are complex and interwoven, review of \nthis Order takes patience. Ultimately, the Court concludes that there are material \nfacts in dispute presented in the record that preclude its grant of t he State \nDefendants’ Motions for Summary  Judgment  on the primary claims . [D0cs. 1567, \n1568 .] The Court will resolve these material factual disputes and related legal \nissues based on the evidence presented at a bench trial to begin on January 9, 2024. \nThat said, the Court finds that seve ral distinct requests for relief advanced solely \nby the Coalition Plaintiffs are largely outside the scope of this case , as discussed in \nSection V.D. of this Order. The Court also concludes that Fulton County’s Motion \nfor Summary Judgment [ Doc. 1571 ] should be granted based on the County’s lack \nof direct authority over the voting system matters in dispute here . \nTo be clear from the start, the Court does not have the legal authority to grant \nthe broad est relief that Plaintiffs request in this case without directly infringing on  \nthe state legislature’s vested power to enact legislation . Even if Plaintiffs prevail on \ntheir substantive claims, the Court cannot order the Georgia legislature to pass \nlegislation creating a paper ballot voting system or judicially impose a state wide Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 4 of 1355 paper ballot system as injunctive relief in this case. Quite simply, the Court has the \nlegal authority to identify constitutional deficiencies with the existing voting \nsystem, but it does not have the power to prescribe or mandate  new voting systems \n(i.e., a paper ballot system) to replace the current, legislatively enacted system. See \nBurdick v. Takushi , 504 U.S. 428, 433 –34 (1992); Wood v. Raffensperger , 501 F. \nSupp. 3d 1310, 1327 –28 (N.D. Ga. 2020), aff’d , 981 F.3d 1307 (11th Cir. 2020).  \nThat said, as the Eleventh Circuit previously recognized in this case, “suits \nchallenging election procedures  [or policies]  are routine ,” and  there are critical \nissues raised in this case that do not “present a political question beyond this \nCourt’s reach.” Curlin g v. Raffensperger , 50 F.4th 1114, 1121 n. 3 (11th Cir. 2022). \nStill, Plaintiffs carry a heavy burden to establish a constitutional violation \nconnected to Geo rgia’s BMD  electronic voting system, whether in the manner in \nwhich the State Defendants have  implemented the voting system — i.e., that it \nimposes serious security voting risks and burdens impacting Plaintiffs ’ voting \nrights  — or otherwise. If Plaintiffs prevail at trial  on one or more of their claims, \nthere are pragmatic, sound remedial policy measures t hat could be ordered or \nagreed upon by the parties, such as (1) providing for the use of printed ballots for \nvote counting without  the use of QR codes, (2) administering a broader scope and \nnumber of election audits to address vote count accuracy and other  related issues, \nand (3) implementing other essential cybersecurity measures and policies \nrecommended by the nation’s leading cybersecurity experts and firms, including  \nthe Department of Homeland Security’s CISA.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 5 of 1356 As the Court has consistently advised the parties, it is in the public interest \nfor them  to seriously engage in the hard work of attempting to reach a consensual \nresolution regarding those voting system remedial measures that the State could \nimplement and that the legislature co uld authorize funding for in the year ahead. \nThe Court cannot wave a magic wand in this case to address the varied challenges \nto our democracy and election system in recent  years, including those presented in \nthis case. But reasonable , timely discussion and compromise in this case , coupled \nwith prompt, informed legislative action , might certainly make a difference  that \nbenefits the parties and the public. For now, though, the Court must proceed with \ntrial starting on January 7, 2023.  \n Legal Stand ard  \nThe Court may grant summary judgment only if the record shows “that there \nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to \njudgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). A factual issue is genuine if \nthere is suffic ient evidence for a reasonable jury to return a verdict in favor of the \nnon-moving party. See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. , 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). \nA factual issue is material if resolving the factual issue might change the suit’s \noutcome under the go verning law. Id. The motion should be granted only if no \nrational fact finder could return a verdict in favor of the non -moving party. Id. at \n249.  \nWhen ruling on the motion, the Court must view all the evidence in the \nrecord in the light most favorable to the non -moving party and resolve all factual Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 6 of 1357 disputes in the non -moving party’s favor. See Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing \nProds., Inc. , 530 U.S. 133, 150 (2000). The moving party need not positively \ndisprove the opponent’s case; rather, the moving party must  establish the lack of \nevidentiary support for the non -moving party’s position. See Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett , 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986). If the moving party meets this initial burden, in \norder to survive summary judgment, the non -moving party must then pres ent \ncompetent evidence beyond the pleadings to show that there is a genuine issue for \ntrial. Id. at 324 –26. The essential question is “whether the evidence presents a \nsufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury [or trial judge] or whether \nit is so one -sided tha t one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Anderson , 477 \nU.S. at 251 –52.  \n Cast of Characters and Glossary of Terms  \nBefore the Court plunges into the factual background of this matter, it \nprovides for the reader’s reference  a “Cast of Characters” that i ncludes  the various \nparties, entities , and other individuals who play a significant role in this case .

These cut down \non the number of ballots that need to be \naudited, while also providing statistical \nconfidence that an incorrect election result is \nnot certified (i.e., made official). As the name \nsuggests, an RLA is designed to limit the risk \nthat a contest is certified with the wrong winner. \nIt does this by increasing the initial sample \nwhen discrepancies are found until either the \nlevel of confidence has been met or a full \nrecount has been performed.  RLAs are an \nincremental audit system: If the margin of an \nelection is wide, very few ballots must be  \nreviewed.

Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 15 of 13516  \n Relevant Background  \nThis election security case has been a long roller coaster ride, with many \ntwists and turns. Below, the Court provides the background and context necessary \nto understand the current dispute and the legal issues before the Court. In so \nproviding, the Court does not make any factual findings . And, a s required at \nsummary judgment, the Court presents the facts in the light most favorable to the \nnon-moving parties  — here , the Plaintiffs.  \nWith that framing in mind, the Court first , in Section A, discusses the \nvulnerabilities and issues raised regarding  the prior DRE voting system that \nexisted at the onse t of this cas e. While this system is no longer in operation, many \nof the very same concerns persist under the current BMD system. After addressing \nthe litigation and prior  findings about the old DRE system, the Court , in Section B, \ncharts the State’s transitio n from the DRE system to the current BMD system. \nNext,  in Section C,  the Court outlines Plaintiffs’ challenges to the constitutionality \nof the current BMD system . Then, in Section D,  the Court  reviews the concerns \npresented by the Plaintiffs  at the 2020 preliminar y injunction hearing , including \ntheir central concerns related to the QR barcodes used to tabulate votes  and the \nauditability of the BMD system  more broadly  (among other  issues ). After that, in \nSection E, the Court traces newer post-2020 developments regarding th ese same \nvulnerability concerns. These new developments include: the issuance of a  \ncomprehensive  report by Plaintiff’s expert, Dr. Alex Halderman , regarding the Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 16 of 13517 vulnerabilities of the BMD system; the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s \nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency’s (“CISA”) review and corroboration of \nDr. Halderman’s central findings; the results of a 2021 technical assessment \nconducted by the State’s retained consulting  cybersecurity firm, Fortalice; and, of \ncourse, the now infamous breach of the election system in Coffee County, Georgia \nand the State’s response to this breach. Finally, the Court addresses the present \nposture of the case in Section F.  \nIn outlining the l andscape of this case, the Court has endeavored to be \nthorough, and, as such, asks the reader to buckle up and bear with the ride.  \n The Vulnerabilities of the Previous DRE System  (And Why \nThey Are  Still Relevant)  \nPlaintiffs filed  this lawsuit in 2017 , raisi ng constitutional challenges to the \nelection system that was then in place in Georgia . (Original Complaint , Doc. 1 -2.)8  \nThis integrated system (“the DRE system”) was composed of the Direct Recording \nElectronic voting machines (“DREs”), the Global Electio n Management Systems \n(“GEMS”) servers, and the online voter registration database . (See generally id. ) \nIn the original complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that the system was compromised, had \nnot been properly examined and tested prior to the election as required by state \nlaw, and was vulnerable to outside manipulation . Plaintiffs ’ original complaint \nthus  alleged that  the State’s continued use of the DR E system unconstitutionally \nburdened their fundamental right to vote and denied them equal protection  of the \n \n8 The case was initially filed in the Superio r Court of Fulton County on July 3, 2017. Defendants \nremoved the case to this Court shortly thereafter.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 17 of 135131 Accordingly, th is Court cannot grant  relief on this issue  as part of the proceedings \nin this case.   \n4. Pollbooks/PollPads  \nFinally, i n challenging the BMD system and all its relevant components, the \nCoalition Plaintiffs also raise issues related the security and reliability of Georgia’s \nvoter registration database , electronic pollbooks , and PollPads.78   \nAs refresher background information, on Election Day, the State’s primary \nway of checking in voters for in -person voting “is with computer tablets containing \nlists of eligible voters in each precinct. These [tablets] are also known as \n‘PollPads.’” Curling v. Raffensperger , 50 F.4th at 1118 . To create the PollPad \ncheck -in lists, the State uses its electronic voter registration database. Id. Prior to \nElection Day, as early voting proceeds, the voter registration database and the \nPollPads a re “updated to reflect whether voters have requested absentee ballots, \nvoted absentee, or voted early.” Id. In the event of errors or malfunctions with the \nPollPads, state law requires each precinct to have a paper backup list. See Ga. \nComp. R. & Regs. 183 -1-12-.19(1) . Each of Georgia’s 159 counties may order its \npaper backup list during a period ending the week before the election. Id. The \ncounties then distribute the sub -lists to their  precincts . Id. But, because the paper \n \n78 The State Defendants on one hand argue that Curling Plaintiffs’ pollbook/PollPad arguments \nfall outsi de the bounds of this case as not properly pled in the operative complaints. The Court \nhas already “addressed and rejected” this argument, ( See 9/28/20 Paper Backup PI Order, Doc. \n918 at 4), and need not further address it here. On the flipside, the Coalit ion Plaintiffs argue that \nthe State Defendants have not addressed this  “claim”  in moving for summary judgment.  But there \nis no separate PollPad/pollbook “claim,” in this case. The Coalition Plaintiffs’ pollbook arguments \nare raised as a component of their s ubstantive constitutional claims (Counts I and II). The State \nDefendants clearly moved for summary judgment in full as to both claim s.  Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 131 of 135132 backups have to be printed and distributed, they do not contain fully up-to-date \ninformation come Election Day.  \n In light of this problem, the Coalition Plaintiffs, at the preliminary \ninjunction stage, sought to require the St ate Defendants to push back the print date \nfor the paper backup lists so that the paper lists would include more up -to-date \ninformation. After a hearing and the presentation of evidence, the Court granted \nthe Coalition Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive re lief and ordered , among other \nthings,  that the State provide updated paper backups at a later date. ( See Doc. 918 \nat 64 –67.) On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the preliminary injunction. \nCurling , 50 F.4th at 1125. In particular, the Circuit Court concluded tha t the \nCoalition Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate “a severe burden on the right to vote \nattributable to the State’s print date for the paper backup,” and that, on the other \nside of the scales, “relevant and legitimate state interests” justified the State’s \nexisting hard copy print date. Id. (citing “administrative factors —the need to \ndistribute a large number of lengthy lists while also managing other preparation \ntasks in advance of Election Day”).  \n Now, at summary judgment, the Coalition Plaintiffs rely , first, on the same \nevidence that the Eleventh Circuit found insufficient to establish a burden that \noutweighed the State’s administrative interests. In addition, the Coalition Plaintiffs \nargue that new evidence supports the grant of relief here. In briefing,  the Coalition \nstates , without citation, that “[t]he State Defendants do not update and distribute \npaper pollbook back -ups when critically needed in runoff elections.” (Coalition Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 132 of 135133 Pls.’ Resp., Doc. 1624 at 77.) They also cite to new evidence that the PollPa ds are \nconnected to the internet. ( Id.) (citing Lenberg's Dep Doc 1613 p. 72 ) (explaining \nthat, while at the Coffee County Elections Office, Ms. Hampton “showed me that it \nwas connected to the internet during its operation and that they literally could go \norder Domino's Pizza and have it delivered while it was connected to the internet.”)  \nSo, according to the Coalition, the PollPads are subject to the same cybersecurity \nrisks as the rest of the electronic voting machinery.  \n The Court wi ll not re hash  a request for a remedy that the Eleventh Circuit \nhas already expressly disapproved as not justified or sufficiently tied to the voting \nproblems identified. Curling , 50 F.4th at 1123  (noting that “delays or wait times at \nthe polling places”  were not sufficiently related to the fact that the State’s paper \nbackups were not up to date).  Indeed, as the Court o f Appeals noted the nature of \nthe curative remedy requested (i.e., the later provision of the voting information) \nwas distinctively administrative in character and challen ged issues  within the \ndiscretion of the Secretary of State’s Office. But, to the extent the  Coalition \nPlaintiffs challenge the  PollPads a s a coordinated part of Georgia’s electronic \nvoting system — regardless of whether  or not the Election Assistance Commission \n(“EAC”) certification techni cally covers  the PollPads  (see Defs. MSJ, Doc. 1568 -1 \nat 6) — the operation of the PollPads  (or other similar d evices used in their place)  \nremain s relevant to the functioning, integrity , and reliability of the election system \nchallenged in this case.  Evidence of this nature is plainly  relevant here  and can be Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 133 of 135134 presented at trial . The Court , however , will not all ow the Coalition  Plaintiffs  to \nwander into remedy turf not directly relevant to the central issues in this case.   \n Conclusion  \nThe importance of the security, reliability, and functionality of state election \nsystem s, classified by the U.S. Homeland Security Department as critical national \ninfrastructure, cannot be overstated in a world where cybersecurity challenges \nhave exponentially increased in the last decade. The dynamics of how a breach in \none part of a cyber  system may potentially carry cybersecurity reverberations for \nthe entire system for years to come exemplifies the important concerns raised in \nthis case.  The constitutional voting claims raised here involve complex evidence, \nlegal issues, and events , heat ed by the political stresses of the era.  Still, the Court \nreminds the reader that the fact that this Order allows Plaintiffs’ constitutional \nclaims to proceed to trial, with some exceptions, simply  means that there are \nsufficient factual disputes underlying  the legal disputes here to require a trial. But, \nas stated at the outset of this long Order, collaborative efforts to address the issues \nraised in this case might be more productive for the public good .   \nFor the reasons articulated above, the State Defendants’ Motions for \nSummary Judgment [Docs. 1567, 1568] are GRANTED IN PART AND \nDENIED IN PART . The motions are granted as to Plaintiffs’ DRE claims (Counts \nI and II of both Third Amended Complaints) but den ied as to the substantive BMD \nclaims (Counts III and IV of the Curling Plaintiffs’ Third Amended Complaint and \nCounts I and II of the Coalition Plaintiffs’ Supplemental Amended Complaint). Case 1:17-cv-02989-AT     Document 1705     Filed 11/10/23     Page 134 of 135135 \nUnder the umbrella of the substantive BMD claims, the Coalition Pla intiffs’ \ncollateral theories  and relief requests  — related to ballot secrecy, scanner settings, \nand paper backups of pollbook information — are, for the most part,  outside the \nscope of this case, with the following exp ress qualification :79 evidence regarding \nthe functioning of the pollbooks  and PollPads ,80 in connection with the operation \nof the election system as a whole, is stil l relevant, as discuss ed in Section V.D.4.  \nAdditionally,  as discussed herein, because the Plaintiffs’ asserte d harm is not \ntraceable to Fulton County,  Fulton County’s Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. \n1571] is GRANTED IN FULL .  \nTrial is set for January 9, 2023.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:** In _United States v. Anthony D. Bressi, Damonico L. Henderson, and Terry Harris_, the court reviewed pretrial motions from the defendants, who were involved in a large-scale cross-border drug distribution scheme. The investigation, initiated by the FBI, uncovered extensive evidence against the defendants, including banking records, surveillance data, and controlled buys. The defendants challenged several aspects of the investigation, including evidence suppression and the need for separate trials, but the court found their claims lacked merit and denied the motions. Although there are references to SHIVA engaging in diverse technological fields, including AI, it did not play a role in the legal issues of this case.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:** The primary legal issue is whether the defendants’ pretrial motions, including motions to suppress evidence and for separate trials (severance), are valid and whether the obtained evidence violated any constitutional rights.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:** The court held that the defendants' pretrial motions to suppress evidence and for severance were without merit, and denied them. The court found that the evidence collected was lawful and that trying the defendants jointly was appropriate.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine three people got in trouble for running a massive illegal drug operation across state lines. The police found a lot of evidence, like weird bank transactions, shady meetings, and hidden labs. The three people tried to argue that the police did something wrong when collecting the evidence and wanted to be tried separately in court.

Both the investigation and the evidence it uncovered were extensive. \nPhysical surveillance. Video surveillance. Bank records. Cell phone records. Cooperating witnesses. Searches. Seizures.

As detailed below, these motion s \nto suppress and to sever are without merit. They are therefore denied.  \nI. BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Background   \n1. Start of the Investigation  \nIn the summer of 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began \ninvestigating the financial dealings of Anthony Bressi,1 an ex-convict who served \nextended prison sentences for manufacturing explosives and methamphetamine.2 \nFollowing his release from prison in 2014, Bressi formed a limited liability \ncompany named SHIVA Science & Technology Group LLC (“SHIVA”) and then \nopened business checking and savings accounts for SHIVA, as well as a personal \nchecking account in his name, with M&T Bank.3 Over the next two years, Bressi \nmade a series of cash deposits into these accounts that appeared to be “structured” —that is, made in amounts below the $10,000 minimum bank \nreporting requirement —  \n tipping off the FBI to possible money laundering.\n4  \nThe FBI then contacted Bressi’s probation officer (at the time, Bressi was \nunder supervision following his release from federal prison) about the possibility \n \n1  See GX 11.1 (Jan. 24, 2018, Case Opening File). \n2  See GX 6.2 (June 8, 2019, SHIVA Search Warrant Affidavit) ¶¶ 4–5. \n3  Id. ¶¶ 14, 17. \n4  See GX 11.1 (Jan. 24, 2018, Case Opening File) at 1–4. \nCase 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 290     Filed 04/19/23     Page 2 of 1003 of information sharing.5 The United States Probation Office for the Middle District \nof Pennsyl vania  notified this Court and requested authorization “to share \ninformation and intelligence with any law enforcement agency involved in [the] \ninvestigation” into Bressi’s “abnormal [banking] activity.”6 The Court granted this \nrequest on October 14, 2016.7  \nAround this time, Bressi closed the accounts with M&T Bank and opened \nnew business and personal bank accounts with First Keystone Community Bank.8 \nConsistent with this Court’s October 2016 Order, Bressi’s probation officers then provided the FBI with copies of Bressi’s and SHIVA’s bank statements with First \nKeystone.\n9  \n multiple “suspicious cash transactions” between \nFebruary and November 2017 totaling approximately $740,000.10  \n Bressi entered the bank’s branch in Danville, \nPennsylvania (where Bressi lived) with a “black duffel bag which contained the \ncash deposit.”11 First Keystone’s employees found this particularly suspect given \n \n5  See Doc. 211- 1 (Oct. 14, 2016, Court Authorization for Information Sharing Between \nProbation and the FBI). \n6  Id. \n7  Id. \n8  GX 6.2 (June 8, 2019, SHIVA Search Warrant Affidavit) ¶¶ 17–18. \n9  Id. ¶ 46. \n10  GX 11.1 (Jan. 24, 2018, Case Opening File) at 3. \n11  Id. \nCase 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 290     Filed 04/19/23     Page 3 of 1004 that “SHIVA, as portrayed by Bressi and its website, does not appear to be a \nbusiness that would deal in cash.”12  \n2. Initial Investigative Steps  \nThe FBI officially opened its investigation into Bressi in January 2018.13 In \nthe eighteen months that followed, the Government built its case against Bressi and \nhis co-defendants, Henderson and Harris, through a series of investigative actions.  \nBanking Records:  the Government \nobtained grand jury subpoenas for Bressi’s and SHIVA’s bank records.14 These \nrecords indicate that between August 2018 and June 2019, Bressi made cash deposits totaling nearly $1.8 million into SHIVA’s First Keystone business \nchecking account.\n15 During this period, there were no incoming wire transfers or \nbusiness checks deposited into SHIVA’s account.16 Instead, the account was \nfunded exclusively by cash deposits.17 Bank personnel informed the FBI that \nBressi personally made all the cash deposits at First Keystone’s Danville branch.18 \nAccording to the bank officials, Bressi stated that he “liked to deal in cash” and \n \n12  Id. \n13  Id. at 1. \n14  See Doc. 208 (Bressi Omnibus Mot. – Gov’t Opp.) at 4. \n15  GX 6.2 (June 8, 2019, SHIVA Search Warrant Affidavit) ¶ 19. \n16  Id. ¶ 22. \n17  Id. \n18  Id. ¶ 20. \nCase 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 290     Filed 04/19/23     Page 4 of 1005 “does not like checks”; and when pressed by bank personnel, he offered only \n“vague answers about his business.”19  \nSHIVA’s Internet Profile and Purchase Activity: According to SHIVA’s \nwebsite, the company wa s involved in “Tech Developments” and “Consulting & \nCustom Solutions.”20 SHIVA claim ed to be “in the process of developing some \nworld -changing technologies in fields as diverse as energy, medicine, beverages, \ncommunications, entertainment, aerospace, transportation, chemistry, robotics, artificial intelligence, and defense.”\n21 SHIVA’s Facebook page highlight ed certain \nproducts it was purportedly designing and manufacturing, including “Dazzle \nCoating” —which it described as “a coating to protect aircraft, drones, rockets, and \nother vehicles from laser directed energy weapons” —and a “Beverage \nSynthesizer” —a device designed to “chemically reproduce any known \nbeverage.”22 SHIVA described itself as “Sci -Fi Realized” because “many of [its] \nproducts do just that —turn science fiction into science fact.”23 \nIn truth, SHIVA was long on fiction and short on fact.

As the Third Circuit has made plain, redacted \nconfessions of this sort, which implicate the precise number of individuals tried \nalongside the confessing co -defendant, violat e the Bruton rule.429  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that the statements made by Bressi can be \nredacted to comply with the Bruton rule. But the redacted transcripts proposed by \nthe Government do not. Before the Court accepts these statements into evidence, \nthe Government will need to perform further redactions, excising all references to Henderson and Harris that, consistent with Third Circuit precedent, qualify as “directly accusatory.”\n430  \n2.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this insurance dispute, Milia LLC sought coverage from State Farm for damage to its premises, claiming that a windstorm caused roof and water damage. State Farm denied the claim, citing policy exclusions and the loss in progress doctrine, and the court granted summary judgment in favor of State Farm only as to Milia’s claim for punitive damages. The remaining breach of contract claims, including the applicability of certain exclusions and defenses, will proceed to trial.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether State Farm was justified in denying coverage based on policy exclusions related to wear and tear and other factors, and whether the loss in progress doctrine applied, thereby precluding coverage.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that State Farm's motion for summary judgment was granted concerning the claim for punitive damages, as Milia lacked evidence of intentional or egregious conduct by State Farm. However, the motion was denied for the breach of contract claims, thus allowing those issues, including the applicability of policy exclusions and defenses, to be resolved at trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have an insurance policy for your house, and a storm hits, causing damage. You ask your insurance company to pay for the repairs, but they refuse, saying that the damage happened because your house was already in bad shape and that you knew it might happen even before you bought the insurance. You take them to court, hoping to win some extra money as a punishment for their denial. The court decides you can't get that extra money because you didn't show they were bad on purpose, but the bigger question of whether they have to pay for the repairs at all will be decided by a jury later.",

The \nmerits of all other claims and defenses will be decided at trial.   \n   Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 1 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>2 \n I. BACKGROUND1 \nA. The Evidence \nOn February 18, 2022, Milia purchased a two -building apartment complex located at 123 and \n131 N. Bingham Street, Memphis, Tennessee 38112 (the “Premises”).2 (ECF No. 51- 2, 1.) Milia \nwas present for National Property Inspections’  pre-purchase inspection of the Premises on \nDecember 2, 2021. ( Id.) The Pre -Purchase Inspection R eport recommended that the roof be \nrepaired or replaced. ( Id.) Regarding the roof, the r eport stated that  (1) it was not possible to inspect \nfor the possibility of active leaks due to a lack of interior access; (2) the roof surface was composed \nof two different materials of different ages; (3) the sealant on joints in the roof was  deteriorated; \n(4) loose and unsecured roofing materi al may allow water intrusion ; (5) wrinkles in roofing \nmaterial and low spots allowed standing water ; and (6) it was recommended that a qualified roofing \ncontractor evaluate the entire roof surface and make any repairs needed to protect against water intrusion. (Id. at 2.)  The report contained photographs depicting existing and/or ongoing water \npooling on the roof. ( Id.) Additionally, it noted that the roof did not have a drainage system, and \ndeterioration on the trim in several locations around the buildings was indicative of water intrusion. \n(Id.)  \nState Farm issued a Businessowners Policy to Milia bearing the policy number 92- NC-X094 -\n5 (the “Policy”) for the Premises. ( Id.) The Policy had an effective date of February 17, 2022, and \nran through February 17, 2023. (ECF Nos. 51- 2, 2-3 & 52- 2, 2.)   \nOn March 23 or 24 of 2022, Milia’s insurance agent reported a claim for damage to the roof to \nState Farm  based on information contractor Southern Roofing provided. (ECF Nos. 51- 2, 5 & 52-\n \n1 The Court only discusses the facts pertinent to State Farm’s Motion. The facts are taken from the parties’ \nfilings. Any disputes of fact are noted.  \n2 Two different buildings are at issue in this case. However, the briefings do not distinguish between the \ntwo in the argumentative sections.  The Court follows the parties lead in doing so.   Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 2 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>3 \n 2, 3. & 5.) Southern Roofing reported that  Building No. 123 had its roof ripped off and there was \nsignificant interior water damage to Units 11 and 12. ( Id.) \nMilia retained Delta Public Adjusters, LLC (“Delta”) to inspect the Premises. ( Id. at 6.) Delta \nin turn requested that Wallace & Todd Consulting (“W&T”) inspect the two buildings. (ECF No. \n51-4, 3.) W&T observed that (1) temporary repairs had been made to the west end of the building \nwhere Delta’s photographs depicted wind damage , and to the apartment below the wind damage \non the east side of Building No. 123; (2) wind damage to the roof seams and an uplifted drip edge along the south side of Building No. 131 could be observed from Building No. 123 and the ground \nunderneath; (3) no winds exceeding 40 MPH  occurred on the date of loss and the most recent date \nof elevated win d (recorded as 64 MPH ) occurred on January 1, 2022; (4) the pre -purchase \ninspection of the Premises did not mention the peeled back condition of the roof; and (5) the limited amount of water damage to the cover board below the wind damaged seams in Building No. 131 supported t he conclusion that the wind damage was a recent occurrence. ( Id. at 4-8.) \nDelta sent State Farm photographs and an estimate of the damages on April 18, 2022. ( ECF \nNo. 51- 2, 6.) On May 3, 2022, with Delta and Southern Roofing present on Milia’s behalf, State \nFarm claims adjuster Elizabeth Fatovic inspected the Premises. ( Id.) Fatovic evaluated Delta’s \nreport after her own inspection and requested that it provide an updated estimate. ( Id.) State Farm \nreceived the  amended estimate on May 7, 2022. ( Id.)  \nBased on Fatovic’s inspection and observations, State Farm retained a structural engineer from \nApplied Building Sciences, Inc. (“ABS”) to investigate  further. ( Id.) ABS found, among other \nthings, that (1) the roof was damaged; (2) at least some of that damage, such as the peeling back of the roof covering at the west end, south wing, and east wing of Building No. 123 occurred \nduring “the storm”; (3) there were numerous observable deficiencies on the roof including Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 3 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>4 \n functional, installation and age -related problems; (4) ponding water at various locations indicated  \na long- term problem with a lack of drainage; (5) no high wind events were reported in the area on \nthe reported date of loss, and the last such event occurred on January 1, 2022; (6) the failure /peel \nback of the roof covering occurred at relatively  low wind speeds and was  attributable to poor \ninstallation  and to the deteriorated condition of the roof; and  (7) Building No. 131 did not incur \nany storm -related damages .3 (ECF No. 51- 5, 230- 32 & 244- 46.)  \nBased on State Farm’s investigation of the claim, ABS’s findings in its r eport, and Fatovic’s \nobservations, it determined that the Premises’ damage was not consistent with damage from a high \nwind event occurring on the reported date of loss. ( ECF No. 51- 2, 6.)  State Farm ’s formal  \ndetermination  states its conclusion that the damage to the P remises was the result of workmanship \nissues and the overall poor condition of the roof, including but not limited to prior water intrusions and neglect. (ECF No. 51- 2, 6.)  In a letter dated July 6, 2022, State Farm informed Milia it was \ndenying the claim because the damage was not covered  based on the  exclusions  cited therein . (Id. \nat 7.)  Milia contends that the findings in ABS’s report are inconsistent with State Farm’s \nconclusion. (ECF No. 52- 2, 3.)  \nMilia’s expert, Robert M. Thompson, inspected the P remises on February 29, 2024, and his \nreport did not reference any damage caused by hail. ( Id.) That re port also acknowledged that winds \ndid not exceed 40 mph near the Premises, nor were there any “elevated wind events” recorded in \nShelby County, Tennessee on the date of loss. ( Id. at 8.)    \nB. The Relevant Exclusions  \nAs relevant here, the policy excludes coverage for:  \n \n \n3 ABS’s report refers to Building No. 123 and Building No. 135. (ECF No. 51- 5, 230- 32.) The relevant \nbuilding numbers in this case are 123 and 131. The Court assumes that reference to “Building No. 135” is a  \ntypographical error.  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 4 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>5 \n 1.  . . . any loss which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the \nfollowing excluded events[:]  \n. . .  j.

[State Farm does] not insure under any coverage for any loss consisting of one \nor more of the items below. Further, [State Farm does] not insure for loss described in Paragraphs 1. and 2. immediately above regardless of whether one or more of the following: (a) directly or indirectly cause, contribute to or aggravate the loss; or (b) occur before, at the same time, or after the loss or any other cause of the loss:  \n \na.

The Lawsuit  \nAfter State Farm denied coverage, Milia brought this lawsuit in state court . (ECF No. 1- 2.) \nMilia allege d that “ [o]n or about March 23, 2022, a certain severe weather event which included \nhigh velocity wind of up to Sixty (60) MPH [] seriously damaged the [Premises’] roofing system.” \n(Id. at 8.) Milia also allege d that the Premises were damaged by “large circumference hail.” ( Id.) \nIt argue d that State Farm was  liable for breach of contract for refusing to cover the wind damage  \nto the  roofing and the water d amage to the interior incurred during the hail and high wind events. \n(ECF No. 1- 2, 9.) Milia sought  $4,000,000 in compensatory damages, pre - and post -judgment \ninterest, attorney’s fees, and punitive damages “as the Court may deem appropriate.” ( Id. at 12.) It \nargue d that punitive damages were  appropriate because State Farm didn’t conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and wrongly denied the claim, in essence. ( See id.  at 11.)  \nState Farm removed the case to this Court on January 4, 2023. (ECF No. 1.) This motion for \nsummary judgment is the only substantive motion that has been filed in this case. The case is set \nfor a jury trial on September 8, 2025. (ECF No. 48.)  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD  \nSummary judgment is proper “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.  56(a). Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 6 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>7 \n The court must view the facts in the record and reasonable inferences that can be drawn from those \nfacts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986).  \nOnce a properly supported motion for summary judgment has been filed, the party \nopposing summary judgment must show that there is a genuine dispute of material fact by pointing to evidence in the record or arguing that the moving party is not entitled to j udgment as a matter \nof law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), (c)(1). “When confronted with a properly supported Motion for Summary Judgment, the party with the burden of proof at trial is obligated to provide concrete evidence supporting its claims and establishing the existence of a genuine issue of fact.” Cloverdale Equipment Co. v. Simon Aerials, Inc., 869 F.2d 934, 937 (6th Cir. 1989) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett , 477 U.S. 317 (1986)). The opposing party “cannot rest solely on the allegations \nmade in [his] pleadings.” Everson v. Leis , 556 F.3d 484, 496 (6th Cir. 2009) (alteration in original)  \n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Skousen v. Brighton High Sch., 305 F.3d 520, 527 (6th \nCir. 2002)). \nA genuine issue for trial exists if the evidence would permit a reasonable jury to return a \nverdict for the nonmoving party. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986). The court’s role is not to weigh evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses, but simply to determine “whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one -sided tha t one party must prevail as a matter of law.” Kroll v. White Lake Ambulance \nAuth., 763 F.3d 619, 623 (6th Cir. 2014) (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 251–52).   \n   Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 7 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>8 \n III. ANALYSIS  \nA. Evidentiary Objections  \nMilia  argues that certain materials State Farm relies on to demonstrate the nonexistence of \ngenuine  dispute s of material fact are inadmissible. Specifically, Milia contends that the National \nProperty Inspections  Report and CoreLogic Wind Verification Report constitute inadmissible \nhearsay and lack authentication. (ECF No. 52- 2, 2 & 5.) It also objects to the recitation of the \npolicy provisions under the best evidence rule. ( Id. at 3.)   \nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2) provides that, in litigating a motion for summary judgment, “[a] party \nmay object that the material cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that \nwould be admissible in evidence.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). Assessing  whether summary -judgment \nevidence could “be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence” at trial under Rule \n56(c)(2) is “ substantially more complicated than just deeming statements hearsay .” Siefert v. \nLiberty Twp ., No. 23- 3692, 2024 WL 4100897, at *6 (6th Cir. Sept. 6, 2024)  (Moore, J., \nconcurring) (quoting Wyatt v. Nissan N. Am., Inc ., 999 F.3d 400, 424 & n.8 (6th Cir. 2021) ). “[T]he \nadvisory committee's commentary for Rule 56 as well as Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit \nprecedent support [the] conclusion that courts, in determining whether to consider hearsay evidence, may inquire as to whether the party opposing summary judgment is capable of producing \nan otherwise inadmissible hearsay statement in a form that will be admissible at trial, i.e., via \nsubstituted oral testimony by the third -party declarant.” Wyatt , 999 F.3d 424 n.8.  \ni. The National Property Inspection s Report  \nIn its Motion for Summary Judgment, State Farm relies on National Property Inspections’ \nPre-Purchase Inspection Report to show that the major issues with the Premises’ roof predated the Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 8 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>9 \n Policy ’s coverage period. (ECF No. 51- 2, 1-2.) Milia requests that the report be excluded because \nit is unauthenticated  inadmissible  hearsay. (ECF No. 52- 2, 2.) State Farm did not respond.  \nThe report likely constitutes hearsay—it contains statements, all of which were made by \nan out of court declarant , and it is being offered for its truth. Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). That said, the \nreport is  admissible as a business record pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 803(6), which allows for the \nadmission  of:  \nA record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis if:  \n(A)  the record was made at or near the time by —or from information transmitted \nby someone with knowledge;  \n(B)  the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, \norganization, occupation, or calling, whether or not for profit;  \n(C)  making the record was a regular practice of that activity;  \n(D)  all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or by a certification that complies with Rule 902(11) or (12) or with a statute permitting certification; and  \n(E)  the opponent does not show that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.  \n \nFed. R. Evid. 803(6). The National Property Inspections Report  was prepared in the normal \ncourse of National Property Inspections’  business as a pre -purchase inspection. (ECF No. 51 -2, 1.) \nThere is no dispute  that the report  was prepared shortly after  the inspection was performed, and \nthat it was prepared by a professional inspector . The preparation of such a  report  is undoubtedly a \nregular practice for those who perform home and building inspections for prospective buyers. \nMilia does not suggest it will challenge any techniques and/ or methodologies  relevant to the \nreport’s preparation, and the Court finds it noteworthy that Milia apparently  found the information \nin the National Property Inspections Report to be sufficiently trustworthy to base its decision to purchase the Premises  on its  findings .  \nWere State Farm to  call a witness to testify to all  these conditions , the Court would \nconclude that the National Property Inspections Report  is admissible hearsay pursuant to the Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 9 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>10 \n business records exception. Since Milia has not argued that there would be any obstacle to State \nFarm calling such a witness, it has not met its burden under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2) . With respect \nto authentication, the same witness would also be able to testify that the report is what it is claimed to be. Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(1) .   \nii. The CoreLogic  Wind Verification Report   \nMilia next seeks the exclusion of the CoreLogic Wind Verification Report on the ground \nthat it is inadmissible hearsay that has not been authenticated. (ECF No. 52- 2, 5.) Per CoreLogic’s \nwebsite: “Wind Verif ication Reports are powered by a fully- automated, severe wind verification \nsystem from CoreLogic. This system combines proprietary, three -dimensional storm models with \nartificial intelligence, radar data, and real -world observations to analyze what actually happened.”\n4  \n The report is not hearsay. The hearsay rule applies only to out -of-court statements . See Fed. \nR. Evid. 801(c)(1). The rule defines a “statement” as “a person's oral assertion, written assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion.” Fed. R. Evid. 801(a). The \nCoreLogic Report constitutes a report of raw data generated by a machine or algorithm. The consensus among the circuit courts is that machine -generated data cannot be hearsay because it \ndoes not constitute a statement under Fed. R. Evid. 801(a). See  Lyngaas v. Curaden Ag, 992 F.3d \n412, 431 (6th Cir. 2021) (collecting cases); see also  4 Federal Evidence § 8:13 (4th ed.) (“On a \nmechanical level, the question whether the hearsay doctrine reaches information provided by \nmachines . . . is easily answered.  Under Rule 801(a), a statement is ‘a person's' utterance, so \nnothing ‘said’ by a machine . . . is hearsay[.]”).  \n Although the CoreLogic Report is not hearsay, State Farm will still bear the burden of \nauthenticating it. See Lyngaas , 992 F.3d at 431. Milia has not  show n that it would be impossible \n \n4 CoreLogic, Wind Verification Reports (2015), https://www.wvs.corelogic.com/pdfs/wind -verification -\nreport -datasheet.pdf.  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 10 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>11 \n for State Farm to produce proof at trial “sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the \nproponent claims it is.” Fed. R.  Evid. 901(a). As such, the Court declines to exclude the CoreLogic Report in  assessing State Farm’s Motion for Summary Judgment. \niii. Insurance Policy Recitation  \nState Farm included the relevant policy provisions  in its s tatement of undisputed facts. \n(ECF No. 51- 2, 3.) Milia objects to this recitation under the best evidence rule. (ECF No. 52- 2, 3.) \nThe best evidence rule provides that “[a]n original writing, recording, or photograph is required in order to prove its content unless these rules or a federal statute provides otherwise.” Fed. R. Evid. 1002. “The purpose of the best evidence rule is to pr event fraud and encourage accuracy.” Slocum \nv. Bear , No. 1:18 -CV-423, 2021 WL 3683873, at *4 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 26, 2021), report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 1:18- CV-423, 2021 WL 3683353 (S.D. Ohio Aug. 19, 2021) \n(citations omitted). It is unclear why Milia takes issue with State Farm’s recitation of the relevant Policy section. As Milia acknowledges, State Farm also provided an admissible duplicate of the \nPolicy in Exhibit C. (ECF No. 51- 5, 7- 47.) The Court declines  to exclude State Farm’s policy \nrecitation under the best evidence rule.  \nB. Coverage and Exclusions  \nState Farm argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Milia’s breach of contract \nclaim because Milia’s claimed loss is  not covered under the Policy. (ECF No. 51- 1, 9.) State Farm \ncontends that it was not required to cover the claimed loss because (1) the exclusions contained in the Policy, including those for “wear and tear,” “deterioration,” “continuous or repeated seepage, discharge or leakage of water… that occurs ove r a period of 14 days or more,” and “faulty, \ninadequate, or defective … workmanship” unequivocally preclude coverage for Milia’s claimed Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 11 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>12 \n loss; and (2) coverage is precluded under the loss in progress doctrine . (Id. at 7-8.) The Court \nhandles several interpretive issues before turning to these two substantive disputes. \ni. Policy Interpretation  \na. Principles of Interpretation  \nStandard contract interpretation principles apply to insurance policies. Hudson v. Liberty Mut. \nPers. Ins. Co., No. 2:23- CV-02060- TLP-CGC, 2024 WL 4101937, at *5 (W.D. Tenn. July 24, \n2024)  (citations omitted). “ Courts must give the insurance policy's terms their common, plain and \nordinary meaning. ” Id. (citations omitted). “ The plain and ordinary meaning is the meaning which \nthe average policy holder and insurer would attach to the policy language.” Id. (quoting Trust Ins. \nCo. v. Phillips , 474 S.W.3d 660, 667 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015)  (internal quotation marks omitted) . \nThe insurance contract “must be read as a layman” would read it . S. Trust Ins. Co., 474 S.W.3d at  \n667 (quoting Paul v. Ins. Co. of N. Am ., 675 S.W.2d 481, 484 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1984)). C ourts \nshould consider the contract “as a whole, ‘for one clause may modify, limit or illuminate another.’” \nId. at 670 (citation omitted).  \nWhen a Tennessee court interprets contract language, it first decides whether the language is \nambiguous. Id. (citing Planters Gin Co. v. Fed. Compress Warehouse Co., 78 S.W.3d 885, 890 \n(Tenn. 2002)) . “If ambiguous language limits coverage, the language must be strictly construed in \nfavor of the insured.” Hudson, 2024 WL 4101937, at *5 (citation omitted).  \nb. Definition and Interpretation of Undefined Phrases  \nHere, the issue of whether the cited Policy exclusions apply is directly dependent upon the \nmeaning of two specific phrases. The Policy excludes coverage for losses “consisting of” or \n“directly and immediately caused by” certain events. ( See, e.g., ECF No. 51- 5, 13- 14.) Neither Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 12 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>13 \n phrase is defined in the Policy, and the briefings do not define them.5 (See ECF No. 51- 1, 11.) The \nonly hint is that the two cannot mean the same thing, since numerous paragraphs exclude coverage  \nfor losses “consisting of” or “directly and immediately caused by” some occurrence. ( See id .)   \n Without a supplied technical definition, the Court turns to the dictionary and its sister courts. \nMerriam -Webster provides that the phrasal verb “consist of” means “to  be formed or made up of \n(specified things or people) .”6  \nAs for “direct and immediate cause,”  another court grappling with  a similar State Farm policy \nthoroughly examined the caselaw and dictionary entries, before concluding that “[w]hen there is a \nchain of events leading to a loss, as here, a direct and immediate cause has been defined as the one \nnearest in time to the specific event at issue.” W inders v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 359 F. Supp. \n3d 1274, 1279 (N.D. Ga. 2018) (providing a textual analysis and collecting cases). Keep in mind \nthat a cause nearest i n time to an event is not necessarily the same as a proximate cause, which \nrefers to the primary or reasonably foreseeable cause of an injury.  \nii. Do the Exclusions Apply?  \nState Farm contends that there does not exist a genuine dispute of material fact and that it is \nentitled to judgment as a matter of law on Milia’s breach of contract claim because the Policy \nexcludes coverage for damage caused by or resulting from wear and tear; rust or other corrosion, \ndecay, deterioration, hidden or latent defect or any quality in property that causes it to damage or \ndestroy itself; settling, cracking, shrinking or expansion; continuous or r epeated discharge or \nleakage of water, or the pr esence of condensation of humidity, moisture or vapor, that occurs over \n \n5 In its brief , State Farm claims that the Policy “does not provide coverage for damage caused by or \nresulting from  wear and tear . . . .” (ECF No. 51 -1, 11 (emphasis added).) While this paraphrasing of the Paragraph 2 \nExclusion suggests that State Farm believes the phrases mean “caused by or resulting from,” nothing in the record \nsupports that interpretation.  \n6 Consist of, Merriam -Webster.com (last visited June 16, 2025).  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 13 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>14 \n a period of 14 days or more ;  or faulty, inadequate or defective workmanship, repair, construction, \nor maintenance. (ECF No. 51- 1, 12.)  \nA review of the disputed and undisputed facts relevant to these exclusions guides this inquiry.  \nFirst, the roof was  in poor condition before Milia purchased the Premises. The National  Property \nInspections ’ December 2, 2021 Pre-Purchase  Inspection Report  provides  that: the sealant on the \njoints was deteriorated, wrinkles in the material permitted pooling of water, unsecured roofing \nmaterials would permit water intrusion , and there was evidence of water intrusion on Unit 123. \n(ECF No.  51-2, 2.) Milia has not  shown that this fact is in dispute. \nSecond, it cannot be genuinely disputed that  winds  did not exceed 40 MPH  and hail did not \nfall at the Premises  on the date of  the claimed  loss.7  Milia’s claims that the Premises were battered \nby “large circumference hail” and “high velocity wind of up to Sixty (60) MPH” on that date are without support in the record. (ECF No. 1-2, 8.) Milia’s own experts support the Court’s \nconclusion. ( See ECF No s. 51-4, 6 & 51- 2, 8.)  \nYet Milia points out that State Farm’s expert, ABS,  confirmed its experts’ findings that wind  \ndamaged the roofing system. (ECF No. 52- 1, 3.) ABS’s report acknowledge s the “failure/peel back \nof the roof covering,” but states that it occurred at “relatively low wind speeds and is attributed to poor installation and to the deteriorated condition of the roof.”  (ECF No. 51- 5, 245.) State Farm  \nnever responded to Milia’s point that its own expert observed that the roof  was damaged  by wind, \nalbeit  “at relatively low wind speeds .” (Id.) Nevertheless,  State Farm ’s position  seems to  be that \nthe excludable causes —wear and tear, deterioration, and poor maintenance of the roof —were \n \n7 The CoreLogic Wind Verification Report provides that  the “[d]ate of loss field  will ignore the normal \n[recording] threshold of 58 MPH within 3 miles, and  will report any wind speed down to  40 MPH.”  (ECF No. 51 -4, \n126.) Since the CoreLogic  Report s are the only measure of the windspeeds in the record,  and the Report provides that \n“[n]o wind greater than 40 MPH [was] detected” on March 23, 2022,  the Court treats the non- occurrence of winds \nexceeding 40 MPH on the date of claimed loss as fact in assessing this M otion. ( See id.  at 125.)  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 14 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>15 \n responsible for the claimed loss because otherwise, the relatively slow wind  speed  would not have \nbeen able to cause such severe damage.  Even so, the nexus between the roof’s condition before \nthe Policy period commenced and the wind damage to the roof is cabined to these  one-line \nconclusions  in ABS’s expert report. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Milia , \nthere remains a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether there exists a  causal  connection \nbetween the roof’s poor condition and th e damage it incurred during the storm .  \nAs explained below, it is not clear that the Policy exclusions apply e ven if it were undisputed \nthat the slow wind able to peel back the roof solely because of the roof’s poor condition. \na. Paragraph 2 Exclusions8         \nTwo Paragraph 2 exclusions are at issue. First is Paragraph 2 .l. which excludes coverage for \nlosses “consisting of” or “directly and immediately caused by” wear and tear, deterioration, and \npoor maintenance of the roof, among other things. (ECF No 51- 5, 13- 14.)  Second is Paragraph \n2.p. which relates to continuous or repeated seepage that occurs over a period of 14 days.9 (Id. at \n15.)  \nInterpreting Paragraph 2.l.  with the definition outlined above, the “consisting of” provision \ncover s scenarios  where the claimed loss itself is wear and tear,  deterioration, poor maintenance, or \nany of the other listed  causes . Here, the claimed loss “ consists of ” a peeled back roof and water \ninfiltration . Thus, by definition, the claimed loss itself is not one of the excludable grounds  set \nforth in Paragraph 2.l .     \n \n8 The denial letter refers to Paragraph 1 .j., an exclusion for losses involving fungi virus or bacteria growth, \nproliferation, spread or presence. (ECF No. 51- 5, 252- 53.) However, the Court cannot find any mention of fungi, \nvirus, or bacteria in the parties’ filings. The denial letter also references 2.k., an exclusion for losses involving neglect  \nof an insured to use all reasonable means to save and preserve property from further damage at and after the time of \nloss. ( Id.) Again, the parties’ briefings are silent on this exclusion . It is unclear why  either  exclusion was invoked. T he \nCourt finds, as a matter of law, that neither exclusion applies . \n9 The denial letter erroneously places this exclusion under Paragraph 3. ( See ECF No. 51 -5, 253- 54.)  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 15 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>16 \n State Farm appears  to be pursuing the other provision under this exclusion , that the loss was \n“directly and immediately caused by” wear and tear, deterioration, poor maintenance or one of the \nother excluded causes . State Farm fares no better under this provision for two reasons .  \nFirst, the record demonstrates at minimum a factual dispute as to whether wind caused the \nclaimed loss. And  while a jury may find that the proximate cause of the roof’s failure/peel back  \nwas its poor condition, State Farm must show that the roof’s poor condition was “the cause nearest \nin time ” to the  roof’s peel back. See Winders , 359 F. Supp. 3d at  1279. Viewing the evidence in \nthe light most favorable to Milia, the nearest cause in time to the roof’s peel back was the wind.  \nHence, exclusion 2.l. may not apply to the roof failure/peel back under the  “directly and \nimmediately caused by” provision.  \nSecond, it seems that the Policy itself requires State Farm to cover the loss under the exact \ntheory it presses in its brief. The Policy provides that if an excluded cause of loss in Paragraphs \n(1) through (7) under “ l. Other Types of Loss” “results in an accidental direct physical loss by any \nof  the  ‘specified causes of loss ’ or by building glass breakage, we will pay for the loss caused by \nthat  specified cause of loss ’. . . .” (ECF No. 51- 5, 14.) The Policy provides that “[s]pecified causes \nof loss” means, among other things, windstorms. ( Id. at 29.) Neither the Policy nor the parties \nexplain what qualifies as a windstorm . The Tennessee Supreme Court’s preferred definition, “the \naspect of a storm [ ] that is an outburst of  tumultuous force [,]” is not particularly helpful either. \nLunn v. Indiana Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co., 184 Tenn. 584, 591 (1947)  (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting 29 American Jurisprudence, page 792, Section 1052). What’s important here is that the classification of a weather event as a windstorm does not appear to require that winds exceed 40 MPH —the slowest  windspeed that the CoreLogic Report would record—or that winds  \nexceed any speed at all. Thus, the exception to this exclusion seems to obligate  State Farm to cover Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 16 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>17 \n the claimed loss if wear and tear and deterioration resulted in a windstorm being able to peel back \nthe roof , allowing for water infiltration . \nAs for the loss pertaining to water infiltration, the Court cannot determine whether the water \ninfiltration occurred due to the roof peeling back, or if it occurred due to the unsecured roofing material  (which would likely satisfy one of the roof condition- related exclusions) . Nothing in the \nrecord  points to either conclusion. State Farm has therefore not met its burden in showing that the \nParagraph 2 .l. exclusion bars coverage for the water infiltration.  \nTurning to 2.p., the exclusion cited as grounds for  denying coverage for the water infiltration \ndamage, the Court cannot find anything in the record that establishes that seepage, discharge or leakage of water occurred over a period of 14 days or more. (ECF No. 51- 1, 15.) Perhaps State \nFarm is referring to the pooling of water on the roof. Even so, it is unclear how long that water was pooling, and i f that pooling of water relates to the claimed water infiltration damage. The \nrecord is insufficient for the Court to determine if this exclusion applies . \n To summarize, State Farm’s M otion is DENIED with respect to its arguments that \nexclusions 1.j., 2.k., 2.l., and 2.p apply and bar coverage. The Court concludes that exclusions 1.j. \nand 2.k. do not apply as a matter of law . State Farm’s defenses under exclusions 2.l. and 2.p. can \nbe renewed at trial.  \nb. Paragraph 3 Exclusions  \nThe relevance of  the Paragraph 3 exclusions is unclear . In its July 6, 2022 letter, State Farm \nrelied on 3.c., which excludes coverage for any loss “ consisting of ” faulty, inadequate, or defective \nworkmanship, repair, materials, and maintenance, among other things. (ECF No. 51- 5, 253- 54.)  \nRegarding 3.c., as established previously, the claimed losses themselves were not faulty, \ninadequate or defective work. T he claimed loss es “consist of” a peeled back roof and water Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 17 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>18 \n infiltration. This means that the  claimed losses  did not “consist of” anything excluded in 3.c. So, \n3.c. cannot be a ground for denying coverage.  \nParagraph 3 also contains an exclusion for weather conditions . Neither party discussed this \nexclusion, but it seems to bear directly on this case ’s facts . This exclusion, 3.a. , precludes coverage \nfor losses “consisting of” weather conditions but only if weather  conditions contribute in any way \nwith a cause or event excluded in paragraphs 1 and 2 to produce the loss. (ECF No. 51- 1, 15.) The  \nCourt cannot make sense of this exclusion. What kind of claimed loss is “formed or made up of” \nweather conditions?  \nThe more pressing point  is that Paragraph 3 .a. provides that if “direct physical loss results \nfrom items 3.a., 3.b., or 3.c.,” then State Farm will “pay for the resulting loss unless the loss itself is one of the losses not insured in SECTION I.” ( Id.) As stated before, the direct and immediate \ncause of the roof peel back appears to be the wind. Regardless of whether the wind speed  was \nsevere  or “relatively low ,” wind speed is a weather event. It would seem the Policy’s plain terms \nprovide coverage.   \n State Farm’s M otion is DENIED with respect to its argument  that Paragraph  3.c. applies \nand bars coverage. State Farm’s defense under this exclusion can be renewed at trial.  \niii. Does the Loss in Progress Doctrine Preclude Coverage?  \nNotwithstanding the applicability of the exclusions, State Farm argues that the claimed loss is \nnot covered under the Policy because the loss in progress doctrine  applies.  (ECF No. 51- 1, 10.)  \nIn short, the loss in progress doctrine  precludes coverage where “the insured is aware of a \nthreat of loss so immediate that it might fairly be said that the loss was in progress and that the insured knew it at the time the policy was issued or applied for.” Inland Waters Pollution Control, \nInc. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co., 997 F.2d 172, 178–79 (6th Cir. 1993). As the Sixth Circuit has Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 18 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>19 \n explained, the loss in progress doctrine embodies “the principle that losses which exist at the time \nof the insuring agreement, or which are so probable or imminent that there is insufficient ‘risk’ being transferred between the insured and the insurer, are not proper subjects of insurance.”  Am. \n& Foreign Ins. Co. v. Sequatchie Concrete Servs., Inc., 441 F.3d 341, 345 (6th Cir. 2006)  (quoting \n7 Couch on Insurance § 102.8) . “[T]he doctrine is properly invoked when the insured knows about \nthe claimed loss bef ore the policy is purchased.”  Union Univ. v. Evanston Ins. Co., No. \n120CV01254JDBJAY, 2022 WL 507666, at *10 (W.D. Tenn. Feb. 19, 2022)  (quoting State Auto. \nMut. Ins. Co. v. R.H.L., Inc ., No. 07- 1197, 2010 WL 909073, at *4 (W.D. Tenn. Mar. 12, 2010) ).  \nThe two Sixth Circuit cases  above  illustrate the sort of foreknowledge an insured must have \nfor the rule to apply. Inland Waters  involved a disposal com pany employed to remove and dispose \nof hundreds of drums containing waste paint material. 997 F.2d at 173. The  company crushed the \ndrums on the customer’s property and discovered that the drums contained liquids were soaking \ninto the soil. Id.  Six years later , investigations of the property determined that the se liquids \ncontaminated the soil and groundwater. Id. The relevant insurance policy’s coverage period \ncommenced after the company crushed the drums, but before the discovery of the soil and groundwater contamination. Id. at 174. At issue was whether the loss in progress doctrine \nprecluded coverage for the disposal company’s liability relating to the contamination.  Id. The Sixth \nCircuit did not reach a conclusion, but directed the district court to consider on remand whether \n“the disposal company knew or should have known at the time it obtained insurance coverage . . . that the  spill would result in damage to the groundwater or that the spill posed an immediate threat \nof damage to the groundwater.” Id. at 179.  \nIn Sequatchie Concrete Services , a general contractor was supposed to provide waterproof \nblocks for a hotel’s construction. 441 F.3d at 342. During construction, the hotel complained that Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 19 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>20 \n the blocks  were not waterproof, and leaks were occurring. Id. at 342. The contractor advised that \nthis was normal until the building was  completed and sealed. Id. at 343. The building continued to \nleak when sealed, and the hotel informed the contractor that it expected that the costs associated \nwith the problem would be paid for. Id. The contractor referred the matter to its corporate counsel \nwho informed the hotel that the contractor was not liable. Id. Afterwards, an insurance company \nissued a policy to t he contractor. Id.  The hotel then sued the contractor. Id. The contractor sought \ncoverage for the loss —legal liability for providing the ineffective waterproof blocks . Id. The Sixth \nCircuit concluded that the loss in progress doctrine precluded coverage  because the contractor was \naware of the threat of los s before the coverage period began. Id.  at 346.   \nState Farm contends that the loss in progress doctrine  precludes coverage here because the Pre-\nPurchase Inspection Report issued before the Policy’s inception put Milia on notice that roof was in poor condition and that some water infiltration had already occurred. (ECF No. 51- 1, 13.) Milia \nresponds that it had no knowledge that a windstorm would lift the roofing system and cause water infiltration on the property. (ECF No. 52- 1, 7.)  \nState Farm urges  that the doctrine’s  applicability  does not hinge on whether Milia had \nknowledge that a windstorm would cause the claimed loss. (ECF No. 53, 5.)  State Farm is right in \na sense. For the doctrine  to preclude coverage here, it must be shown that Milia knew that the \nroof’s condition prior to the coverage period (1)  made the roof’s failure/peel back imminent or \nhighly probable , and (2) made water infiltration imminent or highly probable. See Inland Waters , \n997 F.2d at 179. State Farm has not offe red any evidence in support  of either of these conclusions. \nThe Court concludes that a  reasonable jury could determine that although Milia knew  that the roof \nwas not in good condition before the coverage period , it did not know that either of the two \nscenarios described above were imminent or highly probable.  Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 20 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>21 \n  State Farm’s invocation of the l oss in progress doctrine  does not entitle it to judgment as a \nmatter of law  on this basis . The  Motion is DENIED with respect to this defense. However, State \nFarm can renew the  defense at trial.  \nC. Punitive Damages  \nLast, State Farm contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law  on Milia’s claim for \npunitive damages notwithstanding the Court’s decision as to the merits of Milia’s breach of \ncontract claim because Milia has not produced any evidence that would suggest that it has acted \nintentionally, fraudulently, or recklessly in denying coverage.   \nTennessee law permits  awarding  punitive damages in only “the most egregious”  breach of \ncontract cases where “there is clear and convincing proof that the defendant has acted either \nintentionally, fraudulently, maliciously, or recklessly.”  LBC Assocs. Chattanooga #1 v. Allied \nProp. & Cas. Ins. Co., No. 220CV02650SHLTMP, 2021 WL 5154245, at *6 (W.D. Tenn. Aug. 23, 2021)  (internal  quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nIs this  one of  the most egregious breach of contract cases ?  Milia urges that State Farm’s \ncancellation of the February 17, 2022–February 17, 2023 policy on May 20, 2022, two months \nafter the March 23, 2022 claimed date of loss, amounts to malicious, willful, intentional, or fraudulent conduct. (ECF Nos. 52- 1, 9 & 52- 4, 2.)  The Court does not agree .  \nFirst, Milia’s response is devoid of any evidence demonstrating or even suggesting that State \nFarm acted intentionally, fraudulently, maliciously, or recklessly in denying coverage. A reasonable jury could not find for Milia on its bare, unsupported, and conclusory claim that it is \nentitled to punitive damages.  \nSecond, Milia’s demand for punitive damages appears to arise from allegations that are \nunrelated to its breach of contract claim. In its Complaint, Milia sought punitive damages based Case 2:23-cv-02005-JTF-cgc     Document 55     Filed 07/03/25     Page 21 of 22 \nPageID <pageID>22 \n on State Farm’s conduct in denying coverage. (ECF No. 1- 2, 10- 11.) That denial of coverage \nundergirds the breach of contract claim. Now, Milia claims to be seeking punitive damages for \nState Farm’s premature cancellation of the P olicy. (ECF No. 52 -1, 9.) Milia makes no attempt to \nexplain how the policy cancellation is constitutive of the breach of contract claim. There being no allegation that State Farm is liable for canceling the policy, Milia cannot sustain its claim for punitive damages arising out of t hat cancellation.  State Farm’s Motion for Summary Judgment on \nMilia’s claim for punitive damages is GRANTED. \nIV. CONCLUSION \nConsistent with the foregoing, State Farm’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED \nwith respect to Milia’s claim for punitive damages but DENIED with respect to all other claims.  \nThe Court concludes that exclusions 1.j. and 2.k. do not apply as a matter of law. The merits of all other claims and defenses will be decided at trial.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 3\nrd day of July 2025.  \n \n           s/John T. Fowlkes, Jr.  \n   `     JOHN T.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Anthony Bressi was charged with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute controlled substances. Over the course of five years, several pretrial motions were filed by Bressi, including challenges to evidence and the indictment itself. The court denied most of his motions, addressing issues from the alleged breach of an immunity agreement to the destruction of evidence and constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, while delaying judgment on the misuse of grand jury subpoenas. The case does not involve artificial intelligence or automated systems.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The main legal issues center around whether evidence should be suppressed due to alleged government misconduct, including breaches of agreements, improper use of grand jury subpoenas, illegal search and seizure, and if the indictment should be dismissed based on these grounds and challenges to the Controlled Substances Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied all of Bressi's motions except for reserving judgment on the misuse of grand jury subpoenas, highlighting a lack of evidence supporting Bressi's claims and emphasizing procedural correctness in the government’s actions.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're a kid who got caught breaking a rule and you think the evidence collected against you was mishandled or unfair. You argue that the people in charge didn't play by the rules either. Much like a referee listening to complaints, the judge hears your side and the side of the people who caught you. In this story, the judge thinks that the complaints aren't convincing enough to change the outcome and decides everything but waits to decide on one tricky part involving how you were investigated. In simpler terms, the judge said, \"Most of what you're saying doesn't change what you did wrong, but I'll think more about this one thing before the final decision.\"",

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nOn June 27, 2019, a grand jury indict ed Defendant Anthony Bressi charging \nhim with conspiracy to manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute \ncontrolled substances, and with possession with the intent to distribute controlled \nsubstances.1 In the five years since Bressi entered a plea of not guilty,2 he has filed \na litany of pretrial motions, including several motions to suppress evidence.3 On \nFebruary 28, 2023, the Court denied each of those Motions.4 In July 2023, Bressi’s \nco-Defendant filed a Daubert Motion which Bressi joined.5 Over the next year, the \nparties litigated that issue, including multiple attempts from the Government to \n \n1  Indictment, Doc. 16. Also indicted were co-Defendants Damonico Henderson and Terry \nHarris, who have since pleaded guilty to  the conspiracy count.

The Court was finally able to \nresolve those issues on July 3, 2024.6 Under the impression  that the matter was \nfinally ready for trial, the Court scheduled  a status conference for July 19, 2024 for \nthe purpose of setting a trial date.7 \nBressi had other ideas. The morning of the status conference,  Bressi filed an \nomnibus Motion seeking to suppress certain evidence, dismiss the indictment, limit \nthe testimony of Government expert Re becca Patrick, and compel discovery.8 \nBressi’s Motion is ripe for disposition and,  for the reasons below, is denied in its \nentirety except as to Bressi’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Seized via Grand Jury \nSubpoena.9 \nII. MOTIONS TO DISMISS \nBressi argues three bases to dismiss the Indictment: 1) the Government’s \nfailure to honor an immunity agreement; 2) the Government’s destruction of crucial \nevidence; and 3) the unconsti tutionality of the Controlled Substances Act. The Court \naddresses each in turn. \n  \n \n6  July 3, 2024 Mem. Op. and Ord., Docs. 350-51. \n7  July 3 Ord. ¶ 5; July 9, 2024 Ord., Doc. 352. \n8  Doc. 356. \n9  See id.  ¶¶ 11-17 (requesting suppression of evidence “due to the misuse of the grand jury \nsubpoena power for general investigative purposes ”); Doc. 362, at 6-11 (arguing that “Agent \nO’Malley’s use of the grand jury’s subpoena power was integral to the investigation,” \nwarranting dismissal of the Indictment or, in th e alternative, suppression of evidence resulting \nfrom O’Malley’s search warrants). The Court reserv es judgment as to this  issue pending further \nbriefing and a hearing, whic h will be scheduled by separate Order of Court. Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 2 of 243 A. Immunity Agreement \nBressi alleges that his prosecution is  a breach of an im munity agreement \nbetween him and the Government: \nOn or about June 8, 2019, while his business premises were being \nsearched, Defendant spoke with law enforcement agents and ultimately \nagreed to deliver a counterfeit controlled substance as part of an \nimmunity agreement. Said agreemen t included terms that he would not \nbe prosecuted, that his employees would be left alone and not \nprosecuted[.]10 \nBressi acknowledges that “there was no formal writ ten agreement,” but that \nhe had reason to believe such an agreement existed. He suggests that belief was \nreasonable because 1) when he was previ ously prosecuted in an explosives case, \nnobody else was charged, including the purchasers of the explosives and the \nindividual who arranged the dea l; and 2) while in federal prison, Bressi had “heard \nof numerous situations in which pressure  was placed on family members to force \nsomeone to confess, cooperate  or turn themselves in.” 11  \nFirst, there are any number of reasons th at others may not have been charged \nin the prior case. Second, whether there are situations where law enforcement may \nhave placed pressure on fam ily members of an individual to secure that individual’s \nconfession or cooperation says  nothing about whether that happened here, nor is it \nevidence of an immunity  agreement if it did. \n \n10  Doc. 356, at 41. \n11  Doc. 362, at 15. Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 3 of 244 Bressi also asserts it would be illogical for a seasoned criminal like himself to \nadmit to committing the crime of manuf acturing and distributing hundreds of \nkilograms of controlled substances  absent an immunity agreement.12 It could also be \nsaid that it would be illogical for a person who recently finished a lengthy prison \nsentence, particularly a person who was on supervised release, to immediately \nengage in further criminal activity. Neve rtheless, as evidenced by this Court’s \ncriminal docket and Bressi’s own actions, such things happen all the time.13 \nTo the extent that Bressi observes that  such courses of action are illogical or \nfoolish, the Court agrees. However, Bressi ’s conclusory argument that he is not a \nfool or that he did not engage in  foolish behavior is insufficient.14 Bressi’s Motion \nto Dismiss the Indictment for breach of  an immunity agreement is denied. \nB. Destruction of Evidence \n Dismissal of an indictment for the failure to preserve potentially useful \nevidence is an extreme sanction, only appropriate where the Government engages in \n“shocking, outrageous, and clearly intolerable” conduct which renders the trial \nfundamentally unfair.15 Bressi argues that dismissal of  the Indictment is warranted \n \n12  Id. \n13  The Court notes that this is true even if Bressi is innocent of these charges. Bressi was \npreviously arrested and convicted for Manu facturing Explosives Without a License. United \nStates v. Bressi , No. 4:95-CR-252 (M.D. Pa.). He was la ter convicted of Conspiracy to \nManufacture a Controlled Substance while on pret rial release awaiting trial on the explosives \ncharge. United States v. Bressi , No. 4:96-CR-238 (M.D. Pa.). \n14  See U.S. v. Thompson, 25 F.3d 1558, 1562-63 (11th Cir. 1994)  (conclusory statement that \nimmunity agreement existed insufficient). \n15  U.S. v. Henry , 842 Fed. Appx. 809, 815 (3d Cir. 2021) (collecting cases). Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 4 of 245 because the Government “engaged in the destruction of crucial evidence in this \ncase.”16 Such evidence includes 1) substances  which were not sa mpled or tested by \nthe Pennsylvania State Police drug lab;17 2) office equipment, files, and other \ndocumentation including evidence of SHIVA’s consulting work;18 3) Bressi’s \nemails;19 and 4) surveillance footage.20 The Court addresses each in turn. \nFirst , as discussed in its Memorandum  Opinion regarding Bressi’s Daubert \nMotion, the failure to test or preserve full, unopened containers  was not a ground to \nexclude an expert opinion.21 Similarly, it is not a basis upon which to dismiss an \nindictment. Rebecca Patrick te stified that it would have been impossible to store all \nthe chemicals at her laboratory.22 “[D]estruction of evidence  in accordance with an \nestablished procedure precludes a finding of bad faith absent other compelling \nevidence.”23 As the Court noted in its prior Opini on, Bressi can argue at trial that the \nsealed containers did not contain the substances advertised on their labels.24 He can \nalso cross-examine Patrick and other Gove rnment witnesses regarding their practice \nof disposing of these substances. But Bre ssi has not carried his burden to show bad \nfaith, much less that the destr oyed evidence is exculpatory. \n \n16  Doc. 356 ¶ 45. \n17  Id. ¶ 45. \n18  Id. ¶ 46. \n19  Id. ¶¶ 47-48. \n20  Id. ¶ 49. \n21  July 3, 2024 Mem.

Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 5 of 246 Second, the Government has indicated th at it has not destroyed any other \nevidence recovered from SHIVA or Bressi’s home.25 Rather, it has preserved all of \nthe evidence it recovered— absent the chemicals discussed above—which remains \navailable for Bressi to inspect. Files, equi pment, or other persona l effects which were \nnot recovered by the Government  were left at the premises, which Bressi had been \nrenting. Disposition of the properties was then  left to the landlords . Bressi apparently \nfaults the Government for not taking cust ody of and preserving the entirety of his \npossessions. However, the Government has no such obligation. \nThird , Bressi avers that he “repeatedly offered the Government access to his \nemail accounts, as well as SHIVA’s, yet the Government declined that access and \nfailed to preserve those emails which are now irretrievably lost.”26 Within this \nallegation is an admission that Bressi hims elf had access to these emails; he could \nnot have offered the Government access to something he did not himself possess. \nFurther, “email by its nature, has a sender and a recipient. If [Bressi] wished, he might seek copies of any important email from the counterparty.”\n27 Finally, as above, \nthe Government is under no obligation to seize and preserve Bressi’s emails. \nFourth , the Government notes that “[n]othing of evidentiary value was \nrecovered [from the surveillance footage], as it appeared th at the surveillance system \n \n25  Doc. 365, at 8-10. \n26  Doc. 356, ¶ 47. \n27  U.S. v. Lattanzio , No. CR 15-446 (KM), 2017 WL 3297510, at *7 n.11 (D.N.J. Aug. 1, 2017). Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 6 of 247 continued to record and overwrite from June 8, 2019 through August when it was \nrecovered.”28 Contrary to Bressi’s assertion,  the surveillance system was not \ndestroyed, but remains availa ble to Bressi for inspection upon request, as it has been \nfor the last five years.29 \nFurther, Bressi overstates the extent to which the refere nced evidence would \nbe exculpatory. Throughout this case, Br essi has maintained that SHIVA was a \nlegitimate business engaged in the de velopment of “some world-changing \ntechnologies in fields as diverse as en ergy, medicine, bevera ges, communications, \nentertainment, aerospace, transportation, chemistry, robotics, artificial intelligence, \nand defense.”30 Even if all of that is true, it would have little bearing on the \nGovernment’s allegations that, whatever  else SHIVA was doing, it was also \nmanufacturing and distributing controlled substances. Bressi misunderstands the \nGovernment’s burden. It need not prove  beyond a reasonable doub t that Bressi was \nnot producing “Dazzle coating”—a coating to protect aircraft, drones, rockets, and other vehicles from laser directed energy weapons. Rather, the Government simply \nmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Bressi was manufacturing and distributing controlled substances. \n \n28  Doc. 365, at 10. \n29  Id. \n30  Doc. 271, at 5.

Controlled Substances Act \nIn the half century sin ce the enactment of the C ontrolled Substances Act \ncourts have rejected countle ss challenges to its constituti onality. Bressi’s challenges \nfare no better. The CSA does not violate the Ninth Amendment.31 It does not violate \nthe Commerce Clause,32 and therefore is not an unconstitutional exercise of the \npolice power.33 The delegation to the DEA, through the Attorney General, of the \nscheduling of substances under the CS A is constitutionally permissible.34 \nBressi suggests that the Controlled Substances Act burdens his First \nAmendment right to practice his religion as a Tantrist.35 Bressi avers that Hindus—\nTantra is a sect of Hinduism—have a l ong history of using marihuana, which is \nrestricted by the CSA.36 Assuming arguendo  that the CSA’s prohibition on the use, \n \n31  See Montana Caregivers Ass'n, LLC v. U.S. , 526 F. App’x 756, 758-59 (9th Cir. 2013) \n(rejecting a Ninth Amendment challenge to th e CSA on the basis that it “does not exceed a \nspecific limitation” on Congressional power); Raich v.

MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS \nBressi’s omnibus motion includes fi ve motions to suppress, seeking \nsuppression of 1) financial records,38 2) evidence seized via grand jury subpoena,39 \n3) evidence seized pursuant to defective warrant applications,40 4) evidence seized \nvia post-indictment misuse of the grand jury,41 and 5) fruits of FBI Special Agent \nTimothy O’Malley’s improper coercion of Bressi.42 As noted above, the Court will \nreserve judgment on Bressi’s Motion to S uppress Evidence Seized via Grand Jury \n \n37  Doc. 1, at ¶¶ 1, 5. See Kiczenski v. Gonzales , 237 Fed.

Ward,  989 F.2d 1015, 1017 (9th Cir.1992 )). Bressi’s conclusory \nsubstitution of “psychoactive substances” in place of marihuana is insufficient to carry his \nburden.

Financial Records \nAs Bressi notes, his “financial record s were initially provided to the FBI by \nfinancial institutions through Bank Suspicious Activity Reports (BSARs) and \nCurrency Transaction Reports (CTRs).”44 Arguing that his financial records are \nprotected by the Fourth Amendment, Bressi simply rehashes an argument that this \nCourt already rejected when it deni ed Bressi’s last suppression motion.45 Bressi \neffectively asks the Court to reconsider its prior decision, but offers no new evidence or intervening change in the la w that would warrant doing so.\n46 Bressi’s suggestion \nthat suppression is warranted under the Fifth Amendment is similarly meritless.47 \nB. Improper Grand Jury Subpoenas \nBressi argues that certain evidence should be excluded based on what he \nperceives to be misuse of the grand jury.48 He notes that 56 subpoenas were issued \nafter Bressi and his co-Defendants we re indicted.

Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 10 of 2411 indictments were issued, he reasons that  the dozens of post-indictment subpoenas \n“appear to have been issued for the principal purpose of preparing this case for \ntrial.”49 However, as the Government notes, “it is perfectly reasonable for the grand \njury to continue to investigate” Bressi and his co-Defendants, particularly where \nevidence gained from the Defendants themse lves suggested that additional charges \nmay have been appropriate.50 Bressi’s conclusory suggestion that it “appears” that \nthe Government misused the grand jury is in sufficient for him to  meet his burden to \nshow that “the Government’s use of the grand jury was improperly motivated.”51 \nC. Deficient Warrants \nBressi’s omnibus motion also includes a request for a hearing pursuant to \nFranks v. Delaware,52 and suppression of evidence seized from warrants issued on \nor after June 18, 2018.53 But Bressi already requested a Franks hearing in his prior \nomnibus motion, filed in April 2022, whic h this court denied in February 2023.54  \nBressi’s motion either rehashes argume nts this Court already rejected, makes \nallegations unrelated to Franks , or makes allegations wh ich are both unsupported by \n \n49  Id. ¶ 33. \n50  Doc. 365, at 6. \n51  U.S. v.

So Bressi’s second request for \na Franks hearing is denied. \nIn Franks v. Delaware , the Supreme Court of the United States set out the \nallegations necessary to ma ndate an evidentiary heari ng to challenge a search \nwarrant’s veracity.55 Because there is “a presumption of validity with respect to an \naffidavit supporting [a] search warrant,”56 “Franks requires a demanding \npreliminary showing before a hearing is even granted.”57 \n“To obtain a Franks hearing, a defendant must es tablish (1) that a warrant \napplication contained false statements made  with reckless disregard for the truth and \n(2) that the remaining truthful statements , standing alone, do not establish probable \ncause.”58 “[O]missions are made with reckless di sregard for the truth when an officer \nreckless omits facts that any reasonable person would want to know,” whereas \n“assertions are made with reckless disreg ard for the truth when an officer has \nobvious reasons to doubt the truth of what he or she is asserting.”59  \n“There must be a ‘substantial prelim inary showing’ that the affidavit \ncontained a false statement, which was ma de knowingly or with reckless disregard \nfor the truth, which is material to the finding of probable cause.”60 “In order to make \n \n55  Franks , 438 U.S. at 171-72. \n56  Id. at 155-56. \n57  U.S. v.

Bressi does not point to a specific search \nwarrant he claims was obtained through Agent O’Malley’s intentional or reckless \ndisregard for the truth. He only gestures va guely to the “warrant applications,” the \n“initial warrant applications ,” and “later warrants.”62 As Bressi’s subsequent filing \ndemonstrates, many search warrant s were executed in this case.63 Bressi himself \nseems to acknowledge that his allegations apply to differe nt sections of different \nwarrants. But this C ourt cannot apply the Franks test by babbling about falsehoods \nin the abstract. Instead, as  the Supreme Court of the Un ited States has instructed, \nBressi has a burden to “point out specifically  the portion of the warrant affidavit that \nis claimed to be false.”64 There is a good reason for this burden. For any falsehood \nthat Bressi has satisfied his substantial preliminary showing on, this Court must \n \n61  Id. (citing Franks, 438 U.S. at 171). \n62  Doc. 356 ¶¶ 28-31. \n63  See Exh.

So more specificity is required to \nenable the analysis Bressi is requesting from  this Court. If Bressi expects this Court \nto comb through these e xhibits and litigate the Franks motion on his behalf, that \nexpectation is misplaced. \nSecondly, this Court would never reach the warrant -reconstruction phase for \nBressi’s request because none of his false statements or om issions have been \nsupported through a substantial preliminary showing.  \nIn his initial motion, Bressi argued that Agent O’Malley omitted information \nindicating that SHIVA may have operate d for licit purposes, including Bressi’s \npatent applications, SHIVA’s purchases of non-drug-precursor chemicals, and \nSHIVA’s expenditure of money on supplies and equipment unconnected with the \nproduction of trafficking in contro lled substances or  money laundering.66 This Court \nrejected the argument that these omissions were made with intentional or reckless \ndisregard for the truth becau se such facts showed no contradiction, and therefore \nwere extraneous, rather than facts that  “any reasonable person would have known \nthat . . . the judge would wish to know.”67  Bressi now states that O’Malley was \n \n65  See Wilson , 212 F.3d at 789; Dempsey v. Bucknell Univ. , 834 F.3d 457, 470 (3d Cir. 2016) \n(“[W]hen a court determines that information was asserted or omitted in an affidavit of \nprobable cause with at least r eckless disregard for the truth, it must perform a word-by-word \nreconstruction of the affidavit.”). \n66  Doc. 191 at 14. \n67  Memorandum Opinion, Doc. 271 at 32-33.

It shows that he is doing \nhis job.  \nBressi also states that, as demonstr ated by subsequent testimony, Joesph \nBozenko “was not an individual who was aw are of research lab practices but was \nable only to provide information as to whether there were illicit purposes of these \npurported purchases.”72 First, Bressi has failed to demonstrate that O’Malley was \n \n68  Doc. 356 ¶¶ 24, 26-27. \n69  Id. ¶¶ 19-21 (citing Doc. 297-1 at 12-13). \n70  Doc. 297-1 at 13. \n71  Doc. 356 ¶ 21. \n72  Doc. 356 ¶¶ 22, 26. Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 15 of 2416 aware of any limited expertise on Bozenko’ s part which would have clouded his \nview of whether “SHIVA was doing leg itimate research and development of \nproducts.”73 Any subsequent testimony woul d have no bearing upon O’Malley’s \ntruthfulness when he authored his affidavit.74 Secondly, Bressi ha s failed to cite to \nthe testimony proving the allegation that  Bozenko’s expertise was somehow limited, \nand if so, what impact these limitations had on the affidavit.75 Thirdly, it is not \napparent that a judge would want to know this allegedly omitted information, \nbecause it does not impact Bozenko’s opinion that Bressi’s purchases were for illicit \npurposes. And if there is a nywhere in the 900 plus pages of warrant affidavits and \napplications that O’Malley has cited Boze nko for such expertise, Bressi has failed \nto fulfill his burden to “point out specifically  the portion of the wa rrant affidavit that \nis claimed to be false.”76 So this objection fails three times over to support a \n“substantial preliminary showing” of an intentional or reckless omission. \nBressi’s original omnibus motion also re ferenced information that he alleges \nundermines the confidential witnesses’ credibility: both CW-1 and CW-2 were \n \n73  Id. ¶ 28. \n74  See Thompson v.

Bressi repeats these \nallegations in his supplemental motion.78 This argument, too, is rejected for the same \nreason now as it was rejected in February 2023. \nBressi also claims that Agent O’Malle y withheld various information from \nBozenko.79 But Bozenko is not a magistrate j udge; he was not as ked to evaluate \nprobable cause, but rather to answer a specific question about whether some of \nBressi and SHIVA’s purchases were cons istent with manufacturing controlled \nsubstances. For the same reason, this information would be extraneous to a \nmagistrate reviewing any of O’Malley’s warrant applications. So this has no \nrelevance to Bressi’s Franks motion.  \n \n77  Doc. 191 at 15. \n78  Doc. 356 ¶ 31. See also United States v.

As the Court has explained, the Government is under no \nobligation to either disprove or help Bressi prove his theo ry of the case. As to the \nformer, it can be true th at Bressi was both manufacturing illicit substances and \noperating a legitimate business. As to the la tter, that burden falls entirely on Bressi. \nWhile he can certainly use the evidence the Government does present at trial to prove \nhis case, the Government is under no obligati on to introduce eviden ce for his benefit. \nOf course, Bressi need not prove anythi ng. He need not testify or present any \nevidence at all. However, the nature of Br essi’s filings and arguments to date suggest \nthat he may seek to demonstrate his innoc ence at trial by proving that SHIVA was a \nlegitimate business. To that end, the Cour t notes that, while Br essi has opposed the \nGovernment’s forensic chemis t expert witnesses, he ha s not disclosed any expert \nwitnesses of his own. The Court therefore briefly addresses two issues that it foresees \nas potential areas of concern as trial approaches. \nFirst, Bressi has previously suggested that the Government’s untimely \ndisclosures have precluded him from engaging his own experts.93 Insofar as Bressi \nintends to make a similar argument regarding the evidence which is the subject of \nhis Motion to Compel, discussed below, it is without merit. Bres si cannot circumvent \nthe deadlines for expert disclosures by faili ng to request the evidence that he seeks \nto have an expert review. Where Bressi ha s failed to request that certain evidence is \n \n93  See, e.g., Doc. 348, at 4 (suggesting that Government ’s untimely expert di sclosures prevented \nhim from reviewing evidence with his own expert). Case 4:19-cr-00207-MWB     Document 368     Filed 09/06/24     Page 21 of 2422 made available for inspection until the eleven th hour, he has waiv ed the opportunity \nto have that evidence analyzed by an expert. \nSecond, and related to th e above, Bressi himself ca nnot offer such expert \ntestimony. The right to testify in one’s defense “is not without limit.”94 Bressi “does \nnot have an unfettered right to  offer testimony that is . . . inadmissible under standard \nrules of evidence.”95 Bressi has not disclosed himsel f as an expert, identified any \nsuch expert testimony he ma y provide, nor is there any ev idence in the record that \nhe is quailed to offer such testimony. \nThe Court emphasizes that the Court’s Opinion and ruling does not preclude \nBressi from testifying or introducing evidence in his defense.96 Bressi may still \nattempt to prove that SH IVA was a legitimate busine ss through the Government’s \nevidence or by offering his own non-expert evidence, including his own non-expert \ntestimony.97 The Court does not mean to dissuade Bressi from testifying or otherwise \noffering such evidence. Rather, it is the Cour t’s intention is to provide clarity as the \nparties, in particular Bressi, prepare for trial. \n  \n \n94  Jones v. Davis, 8 F.4th 1027, 1036 (9th Cir. 2021). \n95  Id.

MOTION TO COMPEL \nFinally, Bressi’s omnibus Motion include s a Motion to Compel discovery of \na laundry list of evidence.98 In his brief in support, Br essi advises the Court that \n“[d]efense will endeavor to resolve the[] discovery issues” with the Government and \n“is seeking court assistance in the event th at any of the requested evidence is not \nmade available by the Government.”99 For its part, the Government avers that \nBressi’s Motion is “the first time he has sought additional discovery from the \nGovernment” in the five years this case has been pending.100 The Government then \ngoes through the list of discovery requested  by Bressi, clarifying that the evidence \nhe seeks has been provided previously,101 was provided concurrent with the service \nof the Government’s opposition,102 is available for inspection at Bressi’s request,103 \nor does not exist.104 \n \n98  Doc. 356, Section IV. \n99  Doc. 362, at 29.  \n100  Doc. 365, at 10-11. \n101  Id.

From the Court’s perspective, an intermediate step of an Order \nrequiring the U.S.M.S. to confirm that the bag was,  in fact, not seized wi th any contents, seems \nproper. Bressi may then, within one week of re ceipt of the Marshal’s response, file, a formal \nMotion to Compel production of the bag by the Ma rshal Service. Bressi is advised that any \nsuch Motion shall explain why pr oduction of the bag is necessary. Cf. id. (arguing that the bag \nor its purported contents would have no probative value).

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   The case involves the State of Arkansas suing TikTok Inc., among others, for allegedly violating the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act by deceiving users about the potential access and exploitation of their data by the Chinese government. The main issue is whether the case should be heard in federal court or returned to state court. The federal court determined there was no substantial federal question involved and granted the State’s motion to remand the case back to state court. Although the case involves AI through data usage concerns with TikTok, the decision focused on jurisdiction rather than the AI implications.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   Whether the case should remain in federal court or be remanded to state court, focusing on whether there is a substantial federal question justifying federal jurisdiction.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The court held that the case does not fall under federal jurisdiction because it does not involve a substantial federal question, and thus granted the State's motion to remand the case to the Circuit Court of Union County, Arkansas.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you are explaining this to a child: Arkansas told TikTok, \"You're not telling the truth about what you do with people's secrets.\" TikTok wanted the case to be handled by the bigger, federal court, but the judge decided it wasn't a big enough federal issue, so it sent the case back to a local court where it started.",

BACKGROUND \nOn March 28, 2023, the State filed the instant action in the Circuit Court of Union County, \nArkansas.  ECF No. 3.  The State brings seven (7) claims, all of which arise under the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act .  ECF No. 3.  More specifically, the State alleges that TikTok \nviolat ed the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act by:  \n• “[D]eceiving Arkansas consumers  . . . about the risk of the Chinese Government \nand Communist Part accessing and exploiting their data” ( Count I );  \n Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 1 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>2 \n • “[K]nowingly paint[ing] a false and deceptive picture for Arkansas consumers, \nnamely that there is little to no risk of the Chinese Governm ent or Communist Party \n. . . accessing and exploiting their data” ( Count II );  \n \n• “[F]ailing to ‘ alert Arkansas consumers to the fact that it may share their data with \nentities and individuals in China , who are subject to Chinese Law,’”  in its privacy \npolicy ( Count III);  \n \n• “[N]ot disclosing to consumers in TikTok’s recent or current U.S. privacy \npolicy, . . . the fact that it may share their data with entities and individuals in China, \nwho are subject to Chinese Law” ( Count IV );  \n \n• Not alerting “ Arkansas  consumers to the fact that it may share their data with \nentities and individuals in China , who are subject to Chinese laws that expose their \ndata to the Chinese government and communist party” ( Count V );  \n \n• “[N]ot disclosing to consumers in its recent or current  U.S. privacy policy, . . . that \nit may share their data with entities and individuals in China” ( Count VI ); and  \n \n• Claiming that Separate Defendant TikTok is independent from Separate Defendant \nByteDance “when any reasonable person would understand . . . ByteDance’s influence and direction over TikTok hiring[] employees, and management shows that ByteDance exercises significant control over TikTok” ( Count VII ).   \n \nECF No. 3, at 54- 60.  The State seeks a declaration “that TikTok’s actions are deceptive and \nunconscionable,” an injunction preventing TikTok “from continuing to treat Arkansas consumers \nunconscionably and deceptively,” and an award of “civil penalties of  not more than ten thousand \ndollars per violation” and “costs incurred in inv estigating and pursuing this action.”  ECF No. 3, \nat 61.   \nOn May 9 , 2023, TikTok  removed the action to the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Arkansas.  ECF No. 2.  TikTok  then filed a motion for a stay .  See  ECF No. 6.  \nTikTok expla ined that the State would file a motion to remand and request ed additional time to \nanswer the State’s complaint pending resolution of that remand motion.  ECF No. 6.  On May 15, 2023, the Court granted TikTok’s  motion to stay, requiring the State to f ile any motion seeking \nremand on or before Thursday, June 8, 2023, and providing that “if the Court denies [the State’s]  Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 2 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>3 \n motion for remand, then [the State]  will have thirty (30) days to amend its complaint, and [TikTok]  \nwill then have thirty (30) days aft er the filing of any amended complaint to file [its]  responsive \npleadings.”  ECF No. 7, at 2.   \nOn June 8, 2023, the State timely filed the instant motion to remand.  ECF No. 23.   The  \nState contends th at remand to the Circuit Court of Union County is appropriate because its claims \narise exclusively under Arkansas law.  In the State’s view,  the only issue is “whether the Arkansas \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act allows TikTok to continue lying to Arkansas consumers about what \nhappens with their data.”  ECF No. 24, at 8.   T he State argues that “how the federal government \naddresses the security risks posed by the disclosure of Americans’ private data to the Chinese Government has no bearing on the question of  whether an American company’s statements about \nsuch disclosure violate the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.”  ECF No. 24, at 11.   \nTikTok responds, arguing that the matter is properly in federal court.  ECF No. 25.  TikTok \nemphasizes  the current relationship between Separate Defendant Tik Tok, Separate Defendant \nByteDance, China, and the United States and argues that because the State’s claims touch upon matters of national importance  (namely,  national security and foreign relations), remand is  not \nappropriate .  See  ECF No. 25, at 8 (arguing that the instant action is “an extraordinary attempt by \nthe State to regulate sensitive issues of national security and foreign affairs”).  TikTok provides the Court with a detailed history of the relationship between TikTok and the United States, citing  \nrecent litigation  and executive orders, as well as  negotiations that either occurred in the recent past \nor that are ongoing.  TikTok  identifies the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \n(CFIUS ), which has, while ac ting on behalf of the executive branch, been investigating TikTok’s \nuse of American data and TikTok’s relationship with China .  See 50 U.S.C. § 4565 (establishing \nCFIUS).  For example, TikTok explains that in 2017, Defendant ByteDance acquired Musical.ly, Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 3 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>4 \n which TikTok describes as “a China -headquartered company that distributed a video- sharing \napplication also called Musical.ly.”  ECF No. 25, at 10.  Since then, “the federal government has \nbeen conducting a years -long investigation of the purported risk of Chinese access to U.S. TikTok \nuser dat a through the [CFIUS].”   See ECF No. 25, at 10.  According to TikTok, it has “proposed a \nnumber of strategies  [to the United States government]  to mitigate any purported national security \nrisks,” and negotiations be tween TikTok and the United States government regarding possible \nmitigation strategies are ongoing.  ECF No. 25, at 10- 11. 0F1   \nThe State has replied .  See  ECF No. 31.  T he State argues that federal jurisdiction, when \nnot based on diversity jur isdiction, re quires a question of federal law, which TikTok has not \nidentified.   The question that is  identified by TikTok—“whether TikTok has deceived consumers \nabout the risk that the Chinese  Government will access their personal information” —is one of fact, \nnot law.  See ECF No. 31, at 5.  The State also disagrees with TikTok’s contention that this action \nconstitutes a collateral attack on ongoing federal court proceedings .  ECF No. 31, at 10 (“This suit \nis also not a ‘collateral attack on the federal court proceedings resulting from President Trump’s \n[International Emergency Economic Powers Act] order,’ which was previously enjoined.”  ECF No. 31, at 10 (citation omit ted)).   Specifically, the State maintains  that the proceedings in the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia , which TikTok reference s in its response, \nhave since been dismissed.  ECF No. 31, at 10 ( noting that the executive branch has wi thdrawn \n \n1According to TikTok, former President Donald Trump ordered Defendant ByteDance to divest itself of Defendant \nTikTok, and that order is currently “subject to a pending petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, wh ich has original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear challenges to CFIUS proceedings \nand orders.”  ECF No. 25, at 11.  TikTok further represents that  former President Trump signed an executive order \ndated August 6, 2020 which prohibited transactions between any person in the United States’s jurisdiction and \nDefendant ByteDance or its subsidiaries.  Later that year, the United States Secretary of Commerce issued a document \nimplementing the August 6 executive order and prohibiting transactions between persons in the United States and \nDefendant ByteDance or its subsidiaries.  TikTok explains that the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia has since “entered two preliminary injunctions preventing those prohibitions from going into effect.”  ECF  \nNo. 25, at 12.   \n Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 4 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>5 \n President Trump’s order and the corresponding federal court suits have been dismissed by \nstipulation).  The State states that it is not  asking the Court “to manage relations between China \nand the United States or to ‘second- guess the federal govern ment’s assessment of the nature and \ndegree of any national security threat from China via -a-vis TikTok.’ ”  ECF No. 31, at 5.  Instead, \nit is asking for relief which would require  TikTok to “provid[e] truthful information to Arkansas \nconsumers.”  ECF No. 31, at 10. 1F2  Both parties request a hearing  on the matter of remand.  ECF \nNos. 26, 28. \nII. MOTION TO REMAND  \nThe parties have provided the Court with extensive briefing on the matter, and their \narguments are supported by extensive caselaw.  Despite this, the question before the Court is a \nnovel and difficult one.  Upon careful consideration and for the following reasons, the Court finds \nthat remand is appropriate.   \nFederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.  See Dakota, Minn. & E. R.R. Corp. v. \nSchieffer , 715 F.3d 712, 712 (8th Cir. 2013).  “Subject -matter jurisdiction is a threshold \nrequirement which mus t be assured in every federal case.”  Kronholm v. Fed.  Deposit Ins. Corp., \n915 F.2d 1171, 1174 (8th Cir. 1990) .  “[A] defendant may remove a case filed in state court to \nfederal court .”  In re Cotter Corp., 22 F.4th 788, 791- 92 (8th Cir. 2022).  The burden of \nestablishing federal subject matter jurisdiction rests on the removing party.  Bowler v. Alliedbarton \nSec. Servs. , LLC, 123 F. Supp. 3d 1152, 1155 (E.D. Mo. Aug. 12, 2015).  Here, TikTok cited 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 in its notice of removal, which provides t hat “district courts shall have original \njurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.”   \n \n2The State contends that the United States government “could continue investigating the risks of the Chinese \nGovernment’s access to TikTok’s U.S. -user data and negotiating with TikTok for protections of U.S. -user data, both \nwhile this ac tion proceeds and after TikTok is enjoined from deceiving Arkansas consumers.”  ECF No. 31, at 10 n.1.   Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 5 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>6 \n Following removal, a plaintiff may then “file ‘a motion to remand the case on the basis of \nany defect.’”  In re Cotter Corp., 22 F.4th 788, 791- 92 (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c)).  “ Removal \nstatutes are strictly construed in favor of state court jurisdiction ,” meaning that the Court “must \nresolve all doubts concerning removal in favor of remand.”  Stone v. Baxter Int’t, Inc. , No. \n4:08- cv-3201, 2009 WL 236116, at *5 (D. Neb. Jan. 30, 2009).   \nA. Well -Pleaded Complaint Rule  \nPursuant to the well -pleaded complaint rule, “federal jurisdiction exists only when a federal \nquestion is presented on the face of the pla intiff’s properly pleaded complaint.”  Caterpillar Inc. \nv. Williams , 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987).  “[A] case will not be removable if the complaint does not \naffirmatively allege a federal claim.”  James Valley Coop. Tel. Co. v. S.D. Network, LLC , 292 F. \nSupp. 3d 938, 944 (D.S.D. Nov. 13, 2017) (quoting Beneficial Nat’l Bank v. Anderson, 539 U.S. \n1, 6 (2003)).  Instead, “‘only those cases in which a well -pleaded complaint establishes either that \nfederal law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff’s ri ght to relief necessarily depends on \nresolution of a substantial question of federal law,’ in that ‘federal law is a necessary element of \none of the well -pleaded . . . claims’” will a case be removable.  EFCO Corp. v. Iowa Ass’n of Bus.  \n& Indus., 447 F. Supp. 2d 985, 992- 93 (S.D. Iowa Aug. 23, 2006) (alteration in original) (citation \nomitted) ; see Empire Healthchoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547 U.S. 677, 690 (2006) \n(considering the language of § 1331 and explaining that the phrase “arising under” means that the \n“well -pleaded complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the \nplaintiff’s right to relief necessarily d epends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law ’” \n(citations omitted) ).   \n“[T]he plaintiff is master of his claim and may avoid federal removal jurisdiction by \nexclusive reliance on state law.”  Moore v. Kansas City Pub. Schs., 828 F.3d 687, 692 (8th Cir. Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 6 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>7 \n 2016) (alteration in original) (citation omitted); cf. Minn. by Ellison v. Am. Petroleum Inst., 63 \nF.4th 703, 709 (8th Cir. 2023) (“But ‘a plaintiff may not defeat removal by omitting to plead \nnecessary federal questions.’” (citation omit ted)); Chaganti & Assocs., P.C. v. Nowotny , 470 F.3d \n1215, 1220 (8th Cir. 2006) (“[C]ourts will not permit plaintiff to use artful pleading to close off defendant’s right to a federal forum . . . .” (alteration in original) (citation omitted)).  The Eighth  \nCircuit, relying on Supreme Court precedent, has explained that:  \nBecause this well -pleaded complaint rule “makes the plaintiff the master of the \nclaim[, the plaintiff] may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state \nlaw.” Defendants are “not  permitted to inject a federal question into an otherwise \nstate-law claim and thereby transform the action into one arising under federal law.”  \nIt is firmly established that a federal defense, including a preemption defense, does not provide a basis for r emoval, “even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiff’s \ncomplaint, and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue in the case.”  \n \nCent.  Iowa Power Co- op v. Midwest Indep. Transmission Sys.  Operator, Inc., 561 F.3d 904, 912 \n(8th Cir. 2009) (alteration in original) (citations omitted).   \nThe Court begins with the plain text of the State’s complaint, the obvious starting point \nunder the well -pleaded complaint rule.   See Caterpillar Inc. , 482 U.S. at 392.  The State’s \ncomplaint is sixty -two (62) pages in length, with only seven (7) of those pages setting  forth the \nState’s claims against TikTok.  The other fifty -five (55) pages ar e ostensibly what inspired TikTok \nto remove this action to federal court, as the State dedicates much of its complaint to highlighting \nthe alleged national importance of this action.  For example, the State asserts that “[t]here is a very real and serious bipartisan concern across the U.S. government and in many states that the Chinese Government and/or Communist Party may access TikTok’s U.S. content and user data.”  ECF No. 3, at 25.  Although TikTok seizes upon language like this in support of its argume nt that the matter \nis properly in federal court , the State’s posturing does not necessarily mean that this Court has Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 7 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>8 \n subject matter jurisdiction. 2F3 \nSetting aside the State’s primarily political arguments  regarding the national  “bipartisan \nconcern,” the Court finds that the complaint does not contain any claim  “arising under the \nConstitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.”  See 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  Each of the State’s \nclaims are carefully pled pursuant to Arkansas law, and the State specifically disclaims any \ncontention that its claims are brought pursuant to federal law.  See  ECF No. 3.  Pleading its claims \nin this manner is within the State’s prerogative, as the State  is the master of its own complaint.  \nMoore , 828 F.3d at 692 (citation omitted).  Therefore, because the face of the State’s complaint \ndoes not expressly bring any cause of action under federal law, the Court must turn to TikTok’s \narguments that federal jurisdiction is nevertheless appropriate. 3F4 \nB. Grable  Doctrine  \n The heart of the parties’ disagreement is whether the Grable  doctrine applies.  The Supreme \nCourt has recognized an exception to the well -pleaded complaint rule in which federal -question \njurisdiction may exist despite the fact that the face of the plaintiff ’s complaint contains only \nstate-law claims, as the state law claims “nonetheless turn on substantial questions of federal law.”  \nMinn. By Ellison, 63 F.4th at 711 (quoting Grable and Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng’g & \nMfg., 545 U.S. 308, 312 (2005)).  This exception, commonly referred to as the Grable  doctrine, \nallows a federal court to “treat the claims as arising under federal law even though state law creates the cause of action.”  Id.   However, this exception is only applicable in limited circumstances.  See, \n \n3Much like here, in  Indiana v. TikTok, Inc. , the district court distinguished between political posturing and th e \nsubstantive claims asserted .  See 2023 WL 3596360, at *1.  The district court found that remand to state court was \nappropriate, stating  in part that “[h]a d [the state -plaintiff] filed [a] short and plain statement of its claim, this case \nwould have stayed in [state court] where it was filed.  But since more than 90% of the complaint was devoted to \nirrelevant posturing, [TikTok] removed the cas e . . . .”  Id.   \n \n4To the extent that TikTok argues that the face of the State’s complaint contains claims arising under  federal law , that \nargument  is weak at best and absent at worst.  The parties seem to agree that the complaint, on its face, contains only \nstate-law claims.   Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 8 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>9 \n e.g., Empire Healthchoice Assurance , Inc., 547 U.S. at 699 (referring to a “special and small \ncategory” of cases); Cooper Clinic, P.A. v. Mercy Clinic Fort Smith Cmtys., No. 2:14- cv-02233, \n2015 WL 437571, at *1 (W.D. Ark. Feb. 3, 2015) (ref erring to a “‘slim category’ of federal \njurisdiction” with “unruly” case law (citation omitted)).   \nGrable  set forth a four- element test, which asks whether “a federal issue is: (1) necessarily \nraised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capabl e of resolution in federal court without \ndisrupting the federal -state balance approved by Congress.’”  Minn. by Ellison , 63 F.4th at 711 \n(quoting Gunn v. Minton, 568 U.S. 251, 258 (2013)).  The Eighth Circuit recently explained that \na claim is “necessarily  raised” (and the first Grable  element is satisfied) “when it ‘is a necessary \nelement of one of the well -pleaded state claims’ in the plaintiffs’ complaint.”  Id.   If all four \nelements are satisfied, then “the case is removable although no federal question appears on the \nface of the complaint.”  Id. at 709.  The Grable  analysis requires precision, and “[a] removing \ndefendant ‘should be able to point to the specific  elements of [the plaintiff’s] state law claims’ that \nrequire proof under federal law.”  Id.  at 711 (alteration in original) (citation omitted).  \nAccording to the Eighth Circuit, “[t]he best example” of when Grable  is applicable “is \nGrable  itself.”  Id.   In Grable , the plaintiff filed a quiet title claim in state court following the IRS’s \nseizure and sale of the plaintiff’s property.  In his complaint, the plaintiff “pled a purely state -law \nclaim,” but the determinative question before the district court wa s “whether the IRS had valid \ntitle over the property,” a question which “depended entirely on whether the IRS followed . . . federal notice requirements.”  Id.  at 711; see also Grable , 545 U.S. at 315- 16.  In finding that \nfederal subject matter jurisdictio n existed, the Supreme Court noted that Grable’s outcome would \nhave far -reaching consequences, settling a legal question “once and for all” and “thereafter . . . \ngovern[ing] numerous tax sale cases.”  Empire Healthchoice Assurance, I nc., 547 U.S. at 700 Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 9 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>10 \n (citation omitted).  Grable  does not encompass actions in which the United States simply has an \ninterest in that action.  See id. at 701 (recognizing that although “[t]he United States no doubt \n‘ha[d] an overwhelming interest’” in the subject matter being li tigated, “it takes more than a federal \nelement ‘to open the “arising under” door’” (citation omitted)).  In sum , the Court must determine \nwhether the State’s claims, which are brought pursuant to state law, “nonetheless turn on \nsubstantial questions  of fed eral law.”  Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 711 (quoting Grable , 545 U.S. \nat 312).    Because the State brings its claims pursuant to the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices \nAct, the Court looks to that statute to ascertain what the State is required to prove.  “The Arkansas \nDeceptive Trade Practices Act . . . focuses on consumer protection in connection with trade practices.  The Act makes ‘[e]ngaging in any . . . unconscionable , false, or deceptive act or practice \nin business, commerce, or trade . . .’ unlawful.”  Independence Cnty. v . Pfizer, Inc., 534 F. Supp. \n2d 882, 886 (E.D. Ark. Feb. 11, 2008) ( second, third, and fourth alterations in original) (citation \nomitted).  The Act ’s purpose is to “protect[] consumers from unfair ways of doing business.”  Id.  \nat 887.  “Enforcement rests largely with the Attorney General, Ark. Code Ann. § 4- 88-113(a) -(e).”  \nLeato v. W.  Union Holdings, Inc., No. 5:19- cv-05029, 2019 WL 1051190, at *3 ( W.D. Ark. Mar. \n5, 2019).  To succeed on its claims, the State must demonstrate the following: “(1) a deceptive \nconsumer -oriented act or practice which is misleading in a material respect; and (2) injury resulting \nfrom such act.”  Forever Green Athletic Fields, Inc. v. Lasiter Constr., Inc., 384 S.W.3d 540, 552  \n(Ark. Ct. App. May 11, 2011).   \nTikTok alleges that Grable  applies here because the State will, as an essential element of \nits claims, need to prove “the falsity of [TikTok’s] alleged statements about the Chinese Government’s ability to access and exploit TikTok user data.”  ECF No. 25, at 13.  However, Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 10 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>11 \n TikTok does not direct  the Court to a  specific element of the State’s claims that “turn [s] on \nsubstantial questions of federal law.”  Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 711 (quoting Grable , 545 U.S. \nat 312).  Stated differently, although TikTok asserts variations of the  argument that “federal \njurisdiction is necessary to ensure that a state cannot use its laws and courts to supplant or \nsupplement this country’s national security and foreign policy determinations,” ECF No. 25, at 20, TikTok never identifies which  federal law is at play here.  Simply alleging that “this country’s \nnational security and foreign policy determinations” are at -issue is not suffi cient to warrant the \napplication of Grable .  The Court makes this determination with the understanding that Grable  \napplies in rare circumstances, Empire Healthchoice Assurance , Inc. , 547 U.S. at 699, and that the \nCourt “must resolve all doubts concerning removal in favor of remand,” Stone , 2009 WL 236116, \nat *5.   \nBefore concluding, the Court looks to guidance from other f ederal courts.  In support of its \nmotion to remand, t he State relies extensively on Indiana v. TikTok Inc.   See 2023 WL 3596360.  \nAlthough Indiana v. Tik Tok, Inc. is not binding on this Court, it is factually similar, and the Court \nfinds that it is persuasive here.  In that case, t he State of Indiana brought state-law consumer \nprotection claims against TikTok and sought  an injunction like  that which the State seeks here.  \nAfter TikTok removed the action to federal court, the State of Indiana filed a moti on seeking \nremand.  In support of its argument that the action was properly in federal court, TikTok “claim[ed] that a federal issue [was] necessarily stated and disputed” due to the issue of “the Chinese \nGovernment’s access to TikTok user data and ability to exploit that user data .”  Id. at *2.\n4F5  TikTok \nfurther argued that any state -court proceeding would disrupt CFIUS’s ongoing investigation and \n \n5More speci fically, TikTok argued that “the Court would need to determine whether the Chinese Government will \n‘access and exploit’ user information to ‘help develop artificial intelligence technologies and assist Chinas in \nespionage efforts.”  Id.  at *4.  Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 11 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>12 \n negotiations.   \nThe district court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction and granted remand.  The \ndistrict court disagreed “that potential es pionage has anything to do with [the State of] Indiana’s \nclaim ” because  “the State of Indiana needed only “prove that [TikTok] committed ‘an unfair, \nabusive, or deceptive act, omission, or practice in connection with a consumer transaction’ as that \nis defined i n Indiana Code.”  Id. at *4; Ind. Code § 24- 5-0.5-3(a).  It further found that the State of \nIndiana’s claims did not constitute a collateral attack on CFIUS’s actions.  The district court “fail[ed] to see how anything determined [in the matter] could affec t the outcome of the CFIUS \nproceedings” because those proceedings are “forward- looking,” meaning that “they will address \nhow [TikTok] can mitigate national security issues going forward, while t he State of Indiana’s \nclaims sought “to address alleged misrep resentations that have already occurred.”  Indiana v. \nTikTok, Inc., 2023 WL 3596360, at *4.  Finally, the district court stated that “‘[a] judicial determination that [TikTok Inc.] failed to make a complete disclosure of their data handling \npractices, or t hat they did fully disclose those practices . . . ‘will be neither here nor there to \nCFIUS’s  evaluation of the privacy risks posed by the TikTok app.’ ”  ECF No. 31, at 7 (alteration \nin original) (quoting Indiana v. TikTok, Inc. , 2023 WL 3596360, at *4).   \nNumerous other federal courts have found that Grable  does not apply where the party \nadvocating for federal court jurisdiction simply identified a generalized federal interest.  For \nexample, in Stout v. Novartis Pharm aceutical Corp., the district cou rt found that Grable  was \ninapplicable because the defendants  merely  recognized  “some generalized dispute” touching upon \nfederal law rather than “ identify[ing] any actual dispute respecting the interpretation of federal \nlaw.”  See Nos. 08- 856, 07- 2774, 09- 0095, 09- 916, 07- 1657, 07- 655, 2009 WL 4576130, at *4 \n(D.N.J. Nov. 30, 2009) .  In Pennsylvania v. Eli Lilly & Co. , the district court found that Grable  Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 12 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>13 \n was inapplicable where “liability under the state law claims pres ented . . . [did] not depend on the \nviolation of any federal standard or statute,” despite the fact the state statute incorporated a  \nfederally created definition.  See 511 F. Supp. 2d 576, 581 (E.D. Penn. June 27, 2007).  It is helpful \nto contrast these de cisions with instances in which Grable  did apply, like in Wullschleger v. Royal \nCanine U.S.A., Inc.   See  953 F.3d 519, 522 (8th Cir. 2020)  (finding Grable  applicable where \n“plaintiffs explicitly claim[ed]  that defendants violated the [ Food Drug and Cosmetic Act ], were \nnon-compliant with [United State s Food and Drug A dministration  (FDA)] guidance, and that [the \ndefendants’]  refusal to submit the prescription pet food to FDA  review was improper ”). \nHere, TikTok cites several  generalized  interests that the federal government allegedly has \nin TikTok’s relat ionship with the United States and its citizens.  H owever,  this is insufficient to \nwarrant the application of Grable .  See, e.g., Stout , 2009 WL 4576130, at *4.  TikTok ’s liability \nunder the Arkansas D eceptive Trade and Practices Act does not depend  on any federal standard or \nstatute.   Stated differently, no federal issue is necessarily raised by the State’s claims, and the first \nelem ent of Grable  is not satisfied.  See  Minn . by Ellison , 63 F.4th at 711.  For these reasons, the \nCourt finds that Grable  is inapplicable here.  \nC. Federal Common Law  \n TikTok alternatively argues that this Court has jurisdiction because the State’s claims arise \nunder federal common law.   That is, because the federal government has an interest in uniformity \non matters of foreign affairs and national security and because the federal government has \nexclusive control over national security, the State’s claims are of t he sort appropriate for a federal \ncourt’s consideration.  See  ECF No. 25, at 25 -29.   \nIn addition to cases arising under federal positive law, federal courts also have jurisdiction \nover ‘claims founded upon federal common law.’”  Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 709 (citation Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 13 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>14 \n omitted).  “[A]bsent some congressional authorization to formulate s ubstantive rules of decision, \nfederal common law exists only in such narrow areas as those concerned with the rights and \nobligations of the United States, interstate and international disputes implicating the conflicting rights of States or our relations w ith foreign nations, and admiralty cases.”  Texas In dus., Inc. v. \nRadcliff Materials, Inc. , 451 U.S. 630, 641 (1981).   \nAlthough TikTok does not characterize it as such, TikTok’s  federal common law argument  \nis, essentially, a  complete preemption argument.  See Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 709- 10 \n(considering “federal common law” within the context of complete preemption).  That is, where \nCongress intends for federal law to “preempt a field of law so completely,” then any corresponding “state law claims are considered to be converted into federal causes of action.” Gaming Corp. of \nAm. v. Dorsey & Whitney , 88 F.3d 536, 543 (8th Cir. 1996).\n5F6  Where “[t]here is no substitute \nfederal cause of action for the state- law causes of action [that the state- plaintiff]  brings, . . . [the \nEighth Circuit] appl[ies] the strong presumption against  complete preemption.”  Minn. by Ellison, \n63 F.4th at 710 (emphasis added) .   \nHere, as discussed  above, TikTok does not  direct the Court to any federal law on which the \nState ’s claims turn .  See supra Secti on II.B.  It follows that TikTok also does not identify any are a \nof federal law that covers the subject matter of the State’s claims  “so completely ” that those  claims \nmust be “conver ted into federal causes of action. ”  See Gaming Corp. of Am. , 88 F.3d at 543.  This \nis fatal to TikTok ’s federal common law argument .  See Minn. by Ellison, 63 F.4th at 710 \n(“Because Congress has not acted, the presence of federal common law here does not express \nCongressional intent of any kind—much less intent to completely displace any particular state -law \n \n6The doctrine of preemption is extensive and complex, and the Court need not wade into its murky waters , especially \nwhere the party advocating for its application —here, TikTok—does not discuss the doctrine of preemption at all.  \nAccordingly , the Court simply note s that  the nature of TikTok’s argument is one of preemption.  Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 14 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>15 \n claim. ”).   \nThe Court again considers Indiana v. TikTok, Inc.   See 2023 WL 3596369.  Ther e, the \ndistrict court rejected TikTok ’s argument that federal common law gave ri se to fed eral juris diction, \nexplain ing that because “the Court [could find]  no fundamental federal issue”  at play, the State of \nIndiana’s consumer protection claims did not “implicate[] any of the ‘ narrow  areas ’ in which \nfederal common law exists .”  Id.  Similarly, here, TikTok provides nothing demo nstrating that the  \nState ’s claims fall within one “of the ‘ narrow areas ’ in which  federal common law exists. ”  Id.  \nAccordin gly, the Court declines to exercise subject matter jurisdiction based on TikTok’s federal \ncommon law argument.   \nIII. MOTION FOR ORAL ARGUMENT  \nFinally, th e Court chooses to resolve the State’s motion to remand on the parties’ briefing, \nand oral arguments at a motion’ s hearing is unnecessary.  See  Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b) (“ By rule or \norder, the court may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral \nhearings.”) ; see also Rouse v. Caruso, No. 06 -10961, 2007 WL 5528385, at *1 (E.D. Mich. Apr. \n17, 2007) (“ [T]here is no requirement that the Court . . . hold oral arguments on motions.”).  \nAccordingly, the Court finds that TikTok’s motion for oral argument (ECF No. 26) should be \ndenied.  \n \n     Case 1:23-cv-01038-SOH     Document 32      Filed 07/25/23     Page 15 of 16 PageID #:\n<pageID>16 \n IV. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the State’s motion to remand (ECF No. 23) \nshould be and hereby is GRANTED.  Having resolved the State’s remand motion on the parties’ \nbriefings, TikTok’s motion for leave to present oral argument (ECF  No. 26) is DENIED.  This \nmatter is immediately REMANDED to the Circuit Court of Union County, Arkansas.   \nIT IS SO ORDERED, this 25th  day of July, 2023. \n/s/ Susan O. Hickey                       \nSusan O.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In United States v. Juan Carlos Reynoso, the court granted the government's motion for Reynoso's detention pending trial due to a serious risk of flight. Reynoso is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering related to a cryptocurrency scheme that raised $650 million. The case involves AI and automated systems with regard to the defendant's alleged involvement in business ventures utilizing commission-based marketing plans and cryptocurrency transactions, which include dealings with companies like Thrive99X that have AI components.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether there are any conditions of pretrial release that would reasonably assure Mr. Reynoso's appearance in court and the safety of the community.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court found that no conditions of release could reasonably assure Reynoso's appearance due to his significant financial resources, international ties, dual citizenship, and previous conduct, and therefore ordered his detention pending trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Juan Reynoso is in big trouble for allegedly tricking people into a bad cryptocurrency deal. The court decided he should stay in jail until his trial because they worry he might run away to another country, thanks to his passports and lots of money hidden online.

ARIAS-MARXUACH, United States District Judge  \nPending before the Court is the Government’s Motion for \nDetention Pending Trial (“Motion”). (Docket No. 6). For the reasons \nset forth below, the Court GRANTS the Government’s Motion. \nI. BACKGROUND \nOn June 25, 2025, a federal Indictment was filed against \nDefendant Juan Carlos Reynoso (“Mr. Reynoso” or “Defendant”) and \nanother defendant, charging them with one count of conspiracy to \ncommit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, and one count \nof conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h). (Docket No. 3). The Indictment was issued due to \nDefendant’s involvement in OmegaPro, a cryptocurrency investment scheme that allegedly raised over $650 million from thousands of \ninvestors between July 2019 and November 2022 before its collapse and subsequent loss of all investment funds. (Docket Nos. 3 and 6 at 4). An arrest warrant was issued the same day, and Mr. Reynoso Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 1 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 2 \n \nwas arrested in the Southern District of Florida on July 1, 2025. \n(Docket Nos. 5 and 6). \nOn July 2, 2025, the Government filed the Motion  requesting \nthat Mr. Reynoso be detained pending trial because he poses a \nserious risk of flight. (Docket No. 6). Namely, the Government \nargues that his history of violating a court order, substantial \ntime he spends abroad, and his access to sizable funds overseas \nwould enable Mr. Reynoso to live overseas rather than remain in the United States and face his ongoing criminal case. Id. at 2. On \nJuly 3, 2025, the United States filed an Emergency Motion to Stay Release after a Magistrate Judge in the Southern District of \nFlorida set conditions of release allowing Mr. Reynoso to travel to Puerto Rico on his own accord. (Docket No. 7). The Court granted \nthe stay the same day. (Docket No. 8). A de novo detention hearing \nwas held before this Court on July 23, 2025, with both Defendant and the Government appearing. (Docket No. 37). \nII. FINDINGS OF FACT \nThe Bail Reform Act directs the judicial officer to include \nwritten findings of fact in a detention order. See 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3142(i)(1). The below findings of fact are drawn only from the information, exhibits, and testimony presented at the de novo \nhearing conducted on July 23, 2025, as well as accompanying court documents. These findings of fact have been made solely for the \npurpose of deciding the pending Motion. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j). Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 2 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 3 \n \nA. Proffer by the Government \n \nThe Government proffered that Mr. Reynoso poses both a risk \nof flight and a danger to the community. In support of its \narguments, the Government presented various exhibits, including \nthe following: \n1. A series of screenshots of Instagram posts by a company called Thrive99X. One post discusses a recent company event in June \n2025 in Panama and was liked by an account associated with Mr. Reynoso. Another post includes a group photograph with a \nman who appears to be Mr. Reynoso. \n2. A series of screenshots of Thrive99X’s website, which advertises itself as “an escape plan to freedom” offering \nvarious educational opportunities and artificial intelligence \nsection through a commission-based multilevel marketing \nbusiness plan that offers daily pay-outs to participants. The \nfront page of the website also claims that Thrive99X has been featured on CNN, the New York Times, BBC, Entrepreneur, USA Today, and Forbes; the Government asserts it has found no \nmention of Thrive99X on any of these websites. There is no \ncontact information for Thrive99X. \n3. A printout of a real estate website showing Mr. Reynoso’s Miami property listed for sale and a composite of Google real \nestate listings that appear when the property’s address is \nsearched, including a listing that states “seller motivated.” Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 3 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 4 \n \n4. A series of financial statements involving payments between \nReyFer Digital (“ReyFer”), a company owned by Mr. Reynoso, \nand various third parties. The statements show that Mr. \nReynoso sent money to third parties, then billed third parties \nthrough ReyFer, who later paid Mr. Reynoso that same amount. For example, a series of February 2025 transactions show: (i) \nReyFer billing a Mexican construction company for $35,000; \n(ii) Mr. Reynoso sending the construction company $35,534; (iii) the construction company sending the money to Conduit \nFinancial; (iv) Conduit Financial sending $35,000 to ReyFer; \nand (v) Mr. Reynoso billing ReyFer Digital, who then pays Mr. \nReynoso that same amount. \nFirst, Government argued Mr. Reynoso presents a financial \ndanger to the community because Mr. Reynoso is engaging in similar \nactivities as those that are the subject of the Indictment. Both \nThrive99X and OmegaPro used affiliate-based marketing models, \ninvolved recruitment-based commissions, promised significant \nreturns on investments, and had marketing materials in both English \nand Spanish. Given the similarities between Thrive99X and OmegaPro \nand Mr. Reynoso’s apparent involvement in both companies, the \nGovernment asserts that Mr. Reynoso is willing and able to defraud \nothers through his participation in Thrive99X. The Government also \npoints to Mr. Reynoso’s involvement in AirBit Club, a Ponzi scheme \nthat promised investors returns on cryptocurrency investments; Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 4 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 5 \n \nCrypto World Evolution, “which allegedly used a trading bot linked \nto [a] cyptocurrency exchange that went out of business; IcomTech, \na Ponzi scheme that promised profits from cryptocurrency trading \nand mining; and “a scheme called T-Minor.” All of these schemes \nwere active within the last decade, and Mr. Reynoso has \nacknowledged that both AirBit Club and IcomTech were Ponzi Schemes. \nThe Government argues his pattern of involvement in these types of \nenterprises signals a willingness to continue similar behavior in the future, such as through Thrive99X. As Thrive99X is a web-based \nbusiness, the Government believes that Mr. Reynoso can cause \nfinancial harm to others as long as he has access to the Internet, \neven if under home detention. Consequently, the Government asserts \nMr. Reynoso poses a financial danger to the community that \njustifies continued detention. \nSecond, Government asserts that Mr. Reynoso poses a serious \nrisk of flight such that his appearance in court could not be \nguaranteed without continued detention.  \nAccording to the Government, Mr. Reynoso has continually \nshown a lack of candor to the Government during its investigation and to the Probation Office in his pretrial services report. In \nthe pretrial services report, he refused to disclose the amount of \ncryptocurrency he has access to. He also reported having only one \nbank account with the Bank of America, but he was arrested with a \ndebit card from the Spanish Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 5 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 6 \n \n(“BBVA”) and a debit card in someone else’s name from the \nPanamanian bank Banesco. He has a Peruvian bank account and his \ncompany, ReyFer, has an account at the South Korean KEB Hana Bank. \nReyFer is listed as Mr. Reynoso’s source of employment in the pretrial services report, but he does not disclose his involvement \nin Thrive99X, despite his appearances on social media promoting \nit. As described above, ReyFer has been involved in a serious of \nsuspect transactions involving Mr. Reynoso and various third \nparties that the Government characterizes as money laundering. \nConsequently, the Government argues that Mr. Reynoso has not \nprovided a legitimate source of income and instead showed a lack \nof candor as to his source income and business activities in his \npretrial services report. The Government is also concerned about \nthe extensive liquid and potential undisclosed assets Mr. Reynoso holds. Mr. Reynoso has access to significant liquid assets, as \nbetween February 2021 and December 2023, more than $21.4 million \nwas deposited into Mr. Reynoso’s Binance account. The Government \nnotes that Mr. Reynoso has noncustodial cryptocurrency wallets \nthat only he has the private keys for, meaning that no government \ncan access or evaluate any assets held in those wallets. \nThe Government next points to Mr. Reynoso’s status as a dual \nnational with extensive foreign travel and ties outside the United \nStates. Mr. Reynoso previously listed his Florida property on the \nmarket; at least one real estate listing for the property states Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 6 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 7 \n \n“seller motivated.” The only other property he holds equity in is \na Peruvian house that he has 20 percent interest in. The remaining \ninterest in the house is held by his family members in Peru. Mr. Reynoso holds a Peruvian passport and has family in Peru, including \na sibling. Between 2020 and June 2025, he has taken sixty-eight \ntrips to twenty-one unique destinations, some months spending more \ntime outside the United States than within. Mr. Reynoso has also \nengaged with human smugglers to transport a girlfriend from the Bahamas into the United States.  \nThe Government notes that there is an ongoing civil contempt \nproceeding against Mr. Reynoso in the District of Puerto Rico for \nhis failure to comply with another District Court Judge’s order \nissued March 4, 2025. (See Misc. Case No. 25-0068, Docket No. 20). \nDefendant was held in civil contempt for violating a warrant to \nseize property subject to forfeiture (the “Warrant”) in the amount \nof 119.65 Bitcoin (BTC)\n1 and was ordered to turn over the 119.65 \nBTC to the Government. Mr. Reynoso been fined $10,000.00 for each day he violates the seizure warrant after March 4, 2024; as of the \nde novo hearing, he owed more than $1.4 million in fines. Id. While \nthe contempt ruling is on appeal, the Government argues that Mr. \nReynoso’s failure to comply with the order shows a lack of respect \n \n1 At the time the order in Misc. Case No. 25- 0068 was issued, 119.65 BTC was \nworth approximately $12,650,785.94 USD. The Government and Defendant refer to  \n124 BTC at the de novo hearing, not 119.65 BTC. The Court proceeds using the \n119.65 BTC figure, as was used by the District Judge in Misc. Case No. 25- 0068. Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 7 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 8 \n \nfor court rulings and indicates Mr. Reynoso may refuse to comply \nwith future court orders. \nThe Government’s argument is bolstered by Mr. Reynoso’s \nconduct that resulted in the contempt ruling: the Warrant was \nserved to Mr. Reynoso’s lawyer during the afternoon of Friday, \nJanuary 31, 2025, after the Government called the lawyer to see if \nhe would accept service on behalf of Defendant. The lawyer claimed \nthat he did not open the Warrant or give it to Mr. Reynoso until Sunday, February 2, 2025, but within two hours of the Warrant being \nserved to his counsel, Mr. Reynoso transferred the 119.65 BTC \nsubject to the Warrant to another Bitcoin wallet. (See Misc. Case \nNo. 25-0068, Docket No. 20 at 6-8). Within twenty-four hours, Mr. \nReynoso had moved the Bitcoin into five different wallets. Id. at \n7. The Government argues this indicates Mr. Reynoso deliberately \ndisregarded the Warrant by moving the subject assets out of the \nGovernment’s reach. The Government moved to hold Mr. Reynoso in \ncontempt on February 7, 2025, but Defendant did not move to quash the warrant until February 18, 2025— over two weeks after the \nWarrant was served and the Bitcoin dissipated. Id. At the de novo \nhearing, the Government stated that less than $2 million of Mr. \nReynoso’s Bitcoin has been recovered by the Government, leaving \nmillions of dollars outstanding. \nThird, considering the potential danger to the community and \nrisk of flight posed by Defendant, the Government argues no Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 8 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 9 \n \nconditions of release could protect the community and ensure Mr. \nReynoso’s appearance before the Court. Requiring Mr. Reynoso to \nremain at his house and submit to electronic monitoring would not \nstop him from continuing to engage in business ventures such as \nThrive99X, potentially harming customers and investors. The \nGovernment —and other governments— lack the ability to control and \nmonitor cryptocurrency, making it difficult to know how many assets Mr. Reynoso has and how he is interacting with them. This is shown \nby the millions of dollars from OmegaPro investments that remain \nhidden from the Government. \nB. Proffer by Defendant \n \nMr. Reynoso’s counsel argued that  no statutory presumption of \ndetention applies, Defendant does not pose a serious risk of flight \nor danger to the community, and adequate conditions for his release \ncan be fashioned. \nFirst, Mr. Reynoso disputed the Government’s arguments that \nhe poses a flight risk, arguing he has strong ties to the United \nStates. He is fifty-seven years old and has lived in the United \nStates without a criminal record  since he was twenty, virtually \nthe entirety of his adult life. His four children live in the \nUnited States and are American citizens, as are his grandchildren. \nMr. Reynoso maintains close ties with these family members. While \nhe has travelled extensively for his job, he has always returned \nto the United States. This was true even when he was aware that Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 9 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 10 \n \nthe Government was investigating OmegaPro and that he was a target \nof that investigation; during that period, he entered the United \nStates ten different times. While Mr. Reynoso does hold a Peruvian \npassport, he is willing to surrender it while on release. His \nprevious refusals to disclose his cryptocurrency assets were made \non the advice of his attorney and were not meant to show a lack of \ncounsel to the Court. \nDefendant notes that Mr. Reynoso’s Florida property was taken \noff the market upon request of the Magistrate Judge in the Southern \nDistrict of Florida, but at least some of the listings have \nremained up due to the sheer number of realtors interested in \nselling the property. The property had originally been purchased \nfor Mr. Reynoso, his wife, and his two youngest daughters to live \nin; however, as the daughters ultimately remained in New Jersey, \nthe house did not become a family home and Mr. Reynoso has been \ntrying to sell it for some time. He is also willing to provide the \nhouse to the Court as collateral to demonstrate he will remain in the United States. The Peruvian house is a family home and only \nworth $300,000, so there is no indication Mr. Reynoso would flee Peru or otherwise rely on any Peruvian assets for support. \nMr. Reynoso notes that the contempt order against him is \ncurrently on appeal, and reiterated arguments made before the \nDistrict Judge that held him in contempt. Namely, he argues that \nhe was unaware of the Warrant when he moved the Bitcoin, the Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 10 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 11 \n \nWarrant was issued only after (and because) Bitcoins had started \nto move from the accounts, service of the Warrant was improper, \nthere is no indication he has control over those assets, and his \nprevious counsel that allegedly failed to timely check the contents \nof the Warrant has since been replaced with his current counsel. \nMr. Reynoso questioned whether the Government’s decision to seek \ncontinued detention was punitive due to the contempt ruling, and \nclaimed that he was not the principal in this case, merely the least culpable of the four individuals involved in managing \nOmegaPro. \nDefendant argues that his affiliation with human smugglers \nwas a one-time relationship he used to bring a girlfriend into the \nUnited States (purportedly “the flavor of the month”). He is \ncurrently a witness in the prosecution of those smugglers and has \nnot been indicted in that case. The different bank accounts and \ndebit cards he possesses are for family members and a girlfriend \nin Panama, and the South Korean bank account has been closed for an “extensive period” of time. \nSecond, Mr. Reynoso argues that he does not pose a risk of \ndanger to the community. Importantly, there is no evidence that \nThrive99X is illegal or involved in any type of illegal activity. \nMr. Reynoso’s role in the company is similar to an inspirational \nspeaker and as his social media ties him to Thrive99X, he is not \ntrying to hide his business activity. His previous Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 11 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 12 \n \nacknowledgements that prior business ventures were Ponzi schemes \nare immaterial here as he was not a principal in these matters nor \nwas he charged by the Government for his activities. Furthermore, \nMr. Reynoso’s activities with ReyFer were related to consulting \nactivities he engages in and do not show he participated in money \nlaundering. \nDefendant also noted that the Court has previously expressed \nskepticism that the Government can prove “clear and convincing \nevidence of dangerousness” through proffer and has not found \nsufficient indica of dangerousness in previous cases through \nproffer. Mr. Reynoso’s potential dangerousness was not brought up \nin proceedings in the Southern District of Florida and was not at \nissue until the instant de novo hearing. \nThird, Defendant’s daughter, Vivian Reynoso, appeared to \nspeak on his behalf. Ms. Reynoso is a fulltime student who also \nworks as a health and fitness coach and has obtained a degree of \nfinancial assistance from her father. She has one grandchild, and \nlives in New Jersey. She stated she is close with her siblings and \nthat her family is very close due to her father, as her siblings \nshare the same father, albeit different mothers. Ms. Reynoso is \nwilling to sign any bond issued for Mr. Reynoso, cares for and \ntrusts her father, and believes he would stay in the country if \ngranted release. She was unsure what her father did for a living \nor how much time he spends out of the country. Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 12 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 13 \n \nFourth, Defendant proposed various conditions of pretrial \nrelease. (Docket No. 42). His daughter and two other family members \nare willing to put up a $500,000 bond for him. He would surrender \nhis American and Peruvian passports and submit his Florida \nresidence as collateral. He would also be willing to submit to home detention, electronic monitoring, stop travelling, and \nrefrain from participating in any sort of cryptocurrency business. Mr. Reynoso argued that the amount of money he can access should not be held against him for purposes of release. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Standard of review for a detention or release order \n \nA district court reviews a magistrate judge's order of \ndetention or release under a de novo standard and “need not defer \nto the magistrate judge’s findings or give specific reasons for \nrejecting them.” United States v. Cidraz-Santiago, 18 F.Supp. 3d \n124, 126 (D.P.R. 2014) (citations omitted). A district court may “take additional evidence or conduct a new evidentiary hearing” when “the defendant has placed relevant facts at issue.” Id. \nB. The Bail Reform Act \n \nPursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984 (the “Act”), a \njudicial officer must determine whether a person charged with an offense shall be detained or released pending trial. See 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3142(a). Section 3142(e) of the Act provides that if, after conducting a hearing, “the judicial officer finds that no condition Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 13 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 14 \n \nor combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance \nof the person as required and the safety of any other person and \nthe community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of \nthe person before trial.” Id. § 3142(e). \nSection 3142(f) of the Act establishes the instances in which \nan accused individual is eligible for detention and therefore a \ndetention hearing is proper. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f). Specifically, \n§ 3142(f)(2)(A)-(B) authorizes the court to hold a detention \nhearing upon government motion or sua sponte in cases that involve \n“a serious risk that such person will flee” or “a serious risk \nthat such person will obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice, or \nthreaten, injure, or intimidate, or attempt to threaten, injure, \nor intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” \nThe standard of proof for detention due to dangerousness is \nclear and convincing evidence, while the standard of proof for \ndetention due to risk of flight is preponderance of the evidence. \nId.; see United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 793 (1st Cir. \n1991); United States v. Berríos-Aquino, Crim. No. 22-473, 2022 WL \n17075919, at *1 (D.P.R. Nov. 18, 2022). Clear and convincing \nevidence is “more than preponderance of the evidence but less than \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” United States v. Acevedo-Ramos, 600 \nF.Supp. 501, 509 (D.P.R. 1984) (citations omitted), aff’d, 744 F.2d 203 (1st Cir. 1985) (Breyer, J.). This standard requires “a \nhigh degree of certainty that the information presented supports Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 14 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 15 \n \nthe conclusion of dangerousness or risk to the obstruction of \njustice.” Id.  \nTo determine whether there are conditions of release that \nassure a defendant’s appearance and the safety of the community, \njudicial officers must consider the following factors: (1) the \nnature and circumstances of the offense charged; (2) the weight of \nthe evidence against the defendant; (3) the defendant’s personal \nhistory and characteristics; and (4) the nature and seriousness of \nthe danger to any person or the community that would be posed by \nthe defendant’s release. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g).  \nIV. DISCUSSION \nAfter considering the proffers of counsel, the arguments of \nthe parties, and the transcript of the de novo detention hearing, the Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance \nof the evidence that no conditions of release could reasonably \nassure Defendant’s appearance as required. \nA. The nature and circumstances of the offense charged \n \nAs stated above, Mr. Reynoso was charged with one count of \nconspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349, \nand one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h). (Docket No. 3). Both counts carry \na statutory maximum sentence of twenty years. See 18 U.S.C. §§ \n1343, 1956(a). Both offenses are serious, particularly given the \nsignificant amount of money at stake: $650 million, over half a Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 15 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 16 \n \nbillion dollars. A significant amount of these funds remains \nunrecovered, representing potentially devastating financial losses \nto middle class investors, pensioners, retirees, and public \nservice employees. The severity of the offenses favors detention. \nB. The weight of the evidence against Defendant \n \nIn addition to its Motion and proffer, the  Government \npresented various Exhibits throughout the de novo hearing that \nrelated to the charged offenses and his more recent activities. The Government establishes a detailed summary of Mr. Reynoso’s  \ninvolvement in OmegaPro, describing numerous claims he made about \nOmegaPro to potential investors, the flow of investor funds to Mr. \nReynoso’s accounts, his lavish lifestyle while at OmegaPro, his \nparticipation in other defunct cryptocurrency enterprises (some of \nwhich he admits to be Ponzi schemes), the outstanding civil contempt order against him, and his evasiveness and refusal to \nanswer or withhold information in response to various questions in \nhis pretrial services report. (Docket No. 6 at 7-20). It is \nindisputable that Mr. Reynoso was involved in OmegaPro prior to \nits collapse, and Government’s proffer and Motion ties Mr. Reynoso \nto the charged offenses. The Court concludes the weight of the evidence against Mr. Reynoso is strong and favors detention. \nRegardless of the import or weight of the evidence proffered \nby the Government, the Court is not concerned with \nMr. Reynoso’s guilt or innocence at this time. See 18 U.S.C. § Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 16 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 17 \n \n3142(j) (“Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying \nor limiting the presumption of innocence.”). The Court’s task is \nto assess whether there is a set of conditions that “will \nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c).  \nC. Defendant’s personal history and characteristics \n \nRelevant factors in assessing the risk of flight are that \nDefendant’s residence, family and community ties, employment, \nfinancial resources, and past conduct. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c); \nUnited States v. Torres-Rosario, 600 F.Supp. 2d 327, 335 (D.P.R. \n2009). Mr. Reynoso is a dual Peruvian-American citizen, holding \npassports from both countries. He has an extensive history of work-related foreign travel, such that his own children may not be aware \nwhen and for how long their father is out of the country. However, \nMr. Reynoso has always returned to the United States and has made \nhis home in United States for the past thirty-seven years. He owns \none property in Miami, Florida, albeit a house that he has tried to sell in the past. He also holds a 20 percent interest in a \nfamily home in Peru, providing Defendant with a potential place to \nstay outside the United States. \nThe bulk of Mr. Reynoso’s family have strong ties to the \nUnited States. Three of his children were born in the United States  \nand all four children are American citizens, as were his \ngrandchildren. His two youngest children are minors who have firmly Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 17 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 20 \n \ncarrying the equivalent of more than $5,000 USD in American and \nPeruvian currencies. Id. The Motion and proffer further detail \nvarious cryptocurrency and wire transfers involving Mr. Reynoso and ReyFer that appear to lack a legitimate financial purpose and, \nat the very least, hint at an effort to conceal of the relevant \nfunds. In short, Mr. Reynoso has sophisticated knowledge of various \ncryptocurrencies; the capability to rapidly transfer and access large amounts of money with minimal, if any, oversight; and a pattern of suspicious financial behavior. \nFinally, the Court turns to Mr. Reynoso’s past conduct, which \nis\n— in a word— concerning. Mr. Reynoso has accumulated over $1.4 \nmillion dollars in fines from a March 2025 contempt order issued by another District Judge after he failed to comply with the \nWarrant’s order that he turn millions of dollars in Bitcoin over to the Government. While Defendant later sought to quash the \nWarrant and disputes both the timing of the transfer and whether \nMr. Reynoso maintains control over the assets, the contempt order \nis still standing. The Government correctly notes that a party \ncannot choose to violate a court order instead of challenging it. \nRegardless of a party’s motives or righteousness of his cause, “no \nman can be the judge in his own case.” See Walker v. City of \nBirmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 321 (1967) (affirming a contempt \nconviction against petitioners who violated an injunction instead \nof challenging it). Furthermore, even assuming Mr. Reynoso’s Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 20 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 21 \n \nattorney did err by failing to timely open and inform Mr. Reynoso \nof the Warrant, “as a general rule an attorney’s blunder binds her \nclient.” Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. \n1998). In addition to the civil contempt order, Mr. Reynoso’s \nresponses to the pretrial services report are deficient, failing \nto disclose various bank accounts and his work at Thrive99X. He \nhas been in contact with human smugglers to bring his girlfriend \nand a cousin into the United States illegally. (Docket No. 6 at 2). He has also failed to disclose the extent of his cryptocurrency \nassets, alluding to a Fifth Amendment issue. Viewing Mr. Reynoso’s \npast conduct in its totality, the Court concludes Defendant has \ndemonstrated a marked lack of candor and respect for Court orders. \nHis personal history and characteristics are sufficient to show \nthat he poses a serious risk of flight to justify detention.  \nThe Court briefly reaches Defendant’s argument that Mr. \nReynoso’s wealth should not be held against him and used to justify\n \ncontinued detention. He points to this Court’s opinion in United \nStates v. Ramos-Domínguez to argue that Mr. Reynoso’s strong family \nties justify release even if he has access to significant financial assets. See 698 F.Supp. 3d 224 (D.P.R. 2023). In Ramos-Domínguez, \nmuch like Mr. Reynoso, the Defendant had access “to vast wealth” from his father’s business and his own drug trafficking, but strong \nfamily and business connections in Puerto Rico. Id. at 230. \nHowever, in that case, the Government’s argument about the Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 21 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 22 \n \ndefendant’s foreign contacts was underdeveloped, some of the \nDefendant’s wealth came from his family, and the Government had \npreviously acknowledged that an electronic monitoring device could \naddress concerns about the defendant’s risk of flight. Id. This \nstands in sharp contrast to Mr. Reynoso’s situation, where the extent of Defendant’s foreign travel is dizzying and the Government \nhas emphatically asserted that Mr. Reynoso poses a serious risk of \nflight such that detention is the only way to guarantee his appearance before the Court. Although Mr. Reynoso has strong family \nties to the United States, the Government has sufficiently \nestablished that Defendant has foreign contacts and significant \nassets that render him at risk of flight. Continued detention is \nnot justified only because of Mr. Reynoso’s financial resources, \nbut also because of his dual nationality status, history of international travel, family and property located outside the \nUnited States, previous conduct before the Court, and involvement \nwith human smugglers. \nD. The nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the \ncommunity that would be posed by Defendant’s release \n \nThere are no allegations or information indicating Mr. \nReynoso poses a physical danger to any person or community. The \nGovernment asserts that Mr. Reynoso still poses a financial danger \nto others due to his pattern of past behavior in cryptocurrency \nschemes and current work with ReyFer and Thrive99X. Ultimately, Case 3:25-cr-00284-RAM     Document 46     Filed 07/30/25     Page 22 of 24Criminal No. 25-284 (RAM) 23 \n \nthe Court does not find the Government’s arguments to be \nsufficiently developed as to show Mr. Reynoso poses a danger to \nany person or the community through clear and convincing evidence. There is insufficient evidence to show Thrive99X is engaged in \nillegal activity or that Mr. Reynoso’s work at Thrive99X or ReyFer \nthreatens the financial security of others. \nFurthermore, the Court reiterates its skepticism that 18 \nU.S.C. § 3142 entitles the Government to “establish dangerousness by clear and convincing evidence solely through a proffer” as the \nplain text of the Act “contains no language permitting prosecutors \nto proceed by proffer alone.” Ramos-Domínguez, 698 F.Supp. 3d at \n231. As the Government has not sufficiently established that Mr. \nReynoso poses a danger to any person or community, this factor \nfavors release. \nV. CONCLUSION \nDefendant offers various conditions of supervised release to \nensure his appearance before the Court. However, upon considering \nthe four § 3142(g) factors when reviewing the parties’ proffers, \nexhibits, and motions, the Court concludes that the Government has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Reynoso poses a \nrisk of flight such that no conditions proposed by the parties or \nweighed by the Court would be sufficient to reasonably assure Mr. \nReynoso’s appearance in future proceedings.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**:\n   The court case involved the Association of American Universities and other institutions challenging the National Science Foundation's (NSF) policy capping the reimbursement of indirect costs at 15% for grants awarded to Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs). The plaintiffs argued that this policy was unlawful as it undermined existing negotiated indirect cost rates that are often significantly higher than 15% and was arbitrary and capricious. The court sided with the plaintiffs, vacating the policy.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The main legal issue was whether the NSF's implementation of a 15% cap on indirect cost rates for new grants was lawful under existing statutes and regulations governing federal research grants.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that NSF's 15% Indirect Cost Rate policy was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, vacating the policy and declaring it invalid.\n\n4. **ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)**: Imagine you have a job babysitting where you agree to spend your paycheck on specific toys and snacks for the kids. Then someone suddenly tells you that you can't spend more than a very small limit on snacks, which makes it hard to buy enough snacks. The court told that someone they couldn't just change the rules like that because it wasn't fair or sensible under the agreed terms.",

For the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs ’ request for Summary Judgment is GRANTED , \nDefendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED , and Plaintiffs’  request for a \nPreliminary Injunction is DENIED as moot.  \nI. Background  \nA. The National Science Foundation and Grant -Supported Research  \nThe National Science Foundation Act of 1950, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1861, et seq. (“NSF Act”), \nestablished the National Science Foundation (“NSF”) . Congress has authorized and directed \nNSF: \nto initiate and support basic scientific research  and programs to strengthen scientific \nresearch potential and science education programs  at all levels in the mathematical, \nphysical, medical, biological, social, and other sciences , and to initiate and support \nresearch fundamental to the engineering process ” and programs to strengthen such \nresearch , by making contracts or other arrangements (including grants . . . ) to \nsupport such scientific, engineering, and educational activities  . . .  \n42 U.S.C. § 1862(a)(1). Congress has also specifically authorized NSF “ to initiate and support \nscientific and engineering research  . . . at academic . . . institutions. ” Id. § 1862( c). Almost \nseventy years later , Congress reaffirmed the essential nature of federal research grants , including \n“the sense of Congress that  . . . sustained, predictable Federal funding of basic research is \nessential to United States leadership in science and technology[ .]” American Innovation and \nCompetitiveness Act, Pub. L. No. 114- 329, § 101(a)(1) 130 Stat. 2969, 2970 (2017) . \n Under the NSF Act , NSF has statutory authority “ to enter into contracts or other \narrangements, or modifications thereof, for the carrying on, by organizations or individuals in the \nUnited States and foreign countries, . . . of such scientific or engineering activities as [NSF] deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter [.]” 42 U.S.C. § 1870(c). Further, “[i]n \nmaking contracts or other arrangements for scientific or engineering research,” Congress has directed NSF to:  Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 2 of 523 \n utilize appropriations available therefor in such manner as will in its discretion best \nrealize the objectives of (1) having the work performed by organizations, agencies, and institutions, or individuals in the United States or foreign countries, including Government agencies of the United States and of foreign countries, qualified by training and experience to achieve the results desired, (2) strengthening the research staff of organizations, particularly nonprofit organizations, in the United States, (3)  \nadding institutions, agencies, or organizations which, if aided, will advance scientific or engineering research, and (4) encouraging independent scientific or engineering research by individuals.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1873(e).  \nB. Statutory Provisions Related to Public Contracts  \n The relevant statutory scheme also includes a general ly-applicable  provision related to \npublic contracts, codified at Title 41 of the United States Code. Under 41 U.S.C. § 4708, “ [a] \ncost-type research and development contract (including a grant) with a university, college, or \nother educational institution may provide for payment of reimbursable indirect costs on the basis \nof predetermined fixed -percentage rates applied to the total o f the reimbursable direct costs \nincurred or to an element of the total of  the reimbursable direct costs incurred. ” \n According to the Senate Report accompanying the proposed legislation, the bill allow ed \nindirect cost rates to be set in advance as estimates of future costs , as had been the practice prior \nto a 1956 decision of the Comptroller General, rather than be retroactively adjusted after the fact \nbased on actual costs , as had been the practice following that decision. S. Rep. No. 87- 1826, at 1  \n(1962) .   \nC. The Regulatory Schem e for Federal Grants  \nUnder regulations promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”), \nagencies initiate a competitive grantmaking process by issuing a notice of funding opportunity (“NOFO”)  for a specific research program. See 2 C.F.R. § 200.204. The agency receives \napplications for a period specified in the NOFO , which is typically at least 60 days. Id. \n§ 200.204(b). The agency then conducts a “merit review process” to select grant recipients who Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 3 of 524 \n are “most likely to be successful in delivering results based on the program objectives  . . . .” Id. \n§ 200.205. After an agency selects a grant recipient, it issues a Notice of Award (“NOA”)  \nindicating the amount of funds awarded to the recipient. Id.  § 200.211(c)(1)(iv).  \nThe regulations provide for detailed cost accounting for grants. S ee 2 C.F.R. P t. 200, \nApp. III (“Indirect (F & A) Costs Identification and Assignment, and Rate Determination f or \nInstitutions Of Higher Education (IHEs)”) (“Appendix III to Part 200”); 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.1, \n200.414, 200.501(b), 200.504, 200.514. The regulations provide for two categories of costs: “allowable direct and allocable indirect costs [.]” 2 C.F.R. § 200.402.  \nDirect costs are those “that can be identified specifically with a particular final cost \nobjective, such as a Federal award . . . or that can be directly assigned to such activities relatively easily with a high degree of accuracy.” 200 C.F.R. § 200.413(a). Indirect cost s are those \n“incurred for a common or joint purpose benefit ting more than one cost objective and not readily \nassignable ” to a specific project.  2 C.F.R. § 200.1.  Indirect costs must be designated as either \n“facilities” or “administration .” 2 C.F.R. § 200.414. “‘ Facilities ’ is defined as depreciation on \nbuildings, equipment and capital improvements, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses. ” Id. \n“‘Administration ’ is defined as general administration and general expenses such as the \ndirector ’s office, accounting, personnel, and all other types of expenditures not listed speci fically \nunder one of the subcategories of ‘ Facilities .’” Id. Whether direct or indirect, to be reimbursed, \ncosts must “[b]e necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award” and must be adequately documented. 2 C.F.R. § 200.403. \n“The total cost of a [f]ederal award is the sum of the allowable direct and allocable \nindirect costs minus any applicable credits .” See 2 C.F.R. § 200.402. Generally, an institution  Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 4 of 525 \n negotiate s a pre-determined  indirect cost rate with a federal agency . 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III  \n(C)(4) ( “[N]egotiation of predetermined rates for indirect (F & A) costs for a period of two to \nfour years should be the norm . . . where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available \nare deemed sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect (F & A) costs during the ensuing accounting periods.”)  Federal \nregulations prescribe procedures and methodology for negotiating and determining the indirect cost rate.  See generally  2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III (C). An IHE negotiate s its indirect cost rate \nwith the Department of Health and Human Services ( “HHS ”) or the Department of Defense’ s \n(“DOD”) Office of Naval Research  (“ONR”) , normally depending on which of the two agencies \nhas provide d more funds directly to the educational institution for the most recent three years. 2 \nC.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III (C)(11)(a)(1).  Where neither HHS nor ONR  provides f ederal funding \ndirectly to an IHE, the cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment to that IHE  default s to \nHHS.  Id. IHEs do not negotiate indirect cost rates with NSF. \nNegotiated rates are effective for a specified period, often (but not always) between two \nand four years. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III  (C)(4). E ntities  that expend more than $1,000,000 \nin federal awards  must be audited. 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.501, 200.504, 200.514. An institution’s  \ncovered  indirect  costs  may be adjusted if an audit indicates that an institution has received \nfunding in excess of its actual costs. See 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III (C)(11)(d) (“ The cognizant \nagency for indirect costs must conduct any necessary negotiations with an educational institution regarding amounts questioned by audit that are due the Federal government related to costs covered by a negotiated agreement.”) . \nWhere an indirect cost rate has not been negotiated, an IHE may elect to cover indirect \ncosts by charging a de minimis  indirect cost rate of up to 15% . 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(f). The de Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 5 of 526 \n minim is rate does not require documentation by the IHE to justify the costs. Id.  Use of a de \nminimis rate for indirect costs is at the election of the IHE , and f ederal agencies “ may not require \nrecipients . . . to use a de minimis  rate lower than the negotiated indirect cost rate . . . unless \nrequired by Federal statute or regulation.” Id. \nThe regulations detail federal agency acceptance of negotiated cost rates. See 2 C.F.R. § \n200.414(c). Subsection (c)(1) provides first that “[n]egotiated indirect cost rates must  be \naccepted by all Federal agencies. ” (Emphasis added ). The regulation then allows federal agencies \ncertain deviations from the accepted, negotiated rates “ for either a class of Federal awards or a \nsingle Federal award ” in two circumstances: when a different rate is required by f ederal statute \nor regulation, or when the awarding f ederal agency approve s a different rate  in accordance with \nspecific procedures , see i d., as discussed in detail below.  \nD. NSF Awards  \nThe grant review process at NSF typically takes six months for technical review plus one \nmonth for final administrative review. Coughlin- Piester Decl. ¶  8 [Doc. No. 61]. Over 80% of \nNSF research grants are awarded to IHEs and about 5% are awarded to other nonprofit \norganizations. See id. ¶ 6 [Doc. No. 61] (stating NSF awarded approximately 9,400 of 11,000 \ncompetitive new and renewal grant awards to IHEs); Nat’l Ctr. for Sci. & Eng’g Statistics, Survey of Federal Funds for Research and Development (2023- 2024), Table 7, \nhttps://ncses.nsf.gov/surveys/federal -funds -research -development/2023- 2024# tableCtr13393 \n(last accessed June 20, 2025) .\n2 In Fiscal Year 2024, the average approval rate for grant proposals \n \n \n2 About 7% of funds are awarded to businesses, and less than 1% to state and local governments \nand non- U.S. performers. A pproximately 6% of funds are awarded to federal agencies and \nfederally -funded research and development centers. Id. Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 6 of 527 \n from Institutions of Higher Education (“IHE”)3 was 27%. Coughlin- Piester Decl. ¶  9. [Doc. No. \n61] \nNSF grant recipients generally do not receive lump sum funding. Instead, recipients first \nincur expenses and then, using cost -based accounting systems , recover their actual, documented \ncosts for conducting research. See id. ¶ 10 (explaining NSF grants “ reimburse . . . costs on an as -\nneeded basis based on costs a grantee incurs or expects to incur during a given period”). \nGenerally, NSF has paid indirect costs in grants to IHEs based on indirect cost rates that those institutions negotiate with ONR or HHS. See id. ¶  13; 2 C.F.R. Pt. 200, App. III (C)(11)(a)(1).  \nE. Plaintiffs and Member Institutions’  Federally- Funded Research  \nPlaintiffs are the Association of American Universities (“AAU”), the Association of \nPublic and Land -Grant Universities (“APLU”), the American Council on Education (“ACE ”) \n(collectively “Organizational Plaintiffs”), and 13 research universities: Arizona Board of Regents on behalf of Arizona State University (“A rizona S tate”), Brown University (“Brown”), \nCalifornia Institute of Technology (“Caltech”), The Regents of the University of California (“UC”), Carnegie Mellon University (“ Carnegie Mellon ”), Universit y of Chicago (“UChicago”), \nCornell University (“Cornell”), Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (“ Illinois ”), \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”), Regents of the University of Michigan (“Michigan”), Regents of the University of Minnesota (“Minnesota”), Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (“Penn”), and T he Trustees of Princeton University (“Princeton”)  (collectively \n“University Plaintiffs”).  \n \n \n3 Institutions of Higher Education are de fined at 2 C.F.R. § 200.1, with a reference to 20 U.S.C. \n1001.

NSF’s Indirect Cost Policies and the Policy Notice  \nNSF has included on its website its “Indirect Cost Rate Policies” explaining indirect \ncosts. See NSF’s Indirect Cost Rate Policies [Doc. No. 40- 42]. The website explains that indirect \ncosts are “those costs which are not readily identifiable with a particular cost objective . . . but \nnevertheless are necessary for the general operation of an organization.” Id. at 3–4. The website \nexplains further that “[o]rganizations generally charge indirect costs to federal awards by developing and applying an indirect c ost rate, which is used consistently across an organization’s \nawards.” Id. at 4. The website states further that “[a] predetermined indirect cost rate is a fixed \nrate established for a future fiscal period, based on the actual costs from a representative prior period.” Id. at 5. \nAdditionally , NSF’s Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide  specifies that “it \nis NSF policy that recipients are entitled to reimbursement from award funds for indirect costs ,” \nwhich is “ generally based upon a recipient’s current Federally negotiated indirect cost rate \nagreement.” NSF, Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide X -5 (effective May 20, \n2024), https://nsfgov- resources.nsf.gov/files/nsf24_1.pdf ? (“Award Guide”)  (last accessed June \n20, 2025) . Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 11 of 5212 \n On May 2, 2025, NSF issued its Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% Indirect \nCost Rate , NSF 25 -034.4 The Policy Notice’s subject is: “Adoption of Standard 15% Indirect \nCost Rate for NSF Grants and Cooperative Agreements awarded to Institutions of Higher \nEducation (IHEs).” Id. at 1. The Policy Notice states  that a 15 % cap on indirect costs w ill apply \nto new awards made to IHEs on or after May 5, 2025. Id.  The Policy Notice also assert s that \nNOFOs NSF issues after the effective date w ill include notice of the 15%  cap on indirect cost \nrates. Id. \nThe Policy Notice acknowledge s that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  is a change to NSF’s \npolicy regarding reimbursement of indirect costs, and state s that the change “is intended to \nstreamline funding practices, increase transparency, and ensure that more resources are directed toward direct scientific and engineering research activities.” Id. at 2. The Policy Notice state s \nthat it “serves as public notification of the policies, procedures and general decision- making \ncriteria that NSF has used to justify deviati on from negotiated rates for all awards[.]” Id. at 2. As \nthe rationale for the deviation, the Policy Notice state s that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  supports \nNSF’s commitment to efficiency, consistency, and effectiveness. Id. at 2. \nII. Procedural History  \nPlaintiffs filed this action against the NSF and its Acting Director Brian Stone on May 5, \n2025, challenging the Policy Notice and the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  under the APA.  See Compl. \n \n \n4 See https://www.nsf.gov/policies/document/indirect -cost-rate (accessed May 6, 2025, at 3:59 \np.m.). Plaintiffs state that a copy of this Policy Notice is attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint , \nsee Compl. ¶ 8 [Doc. No. 1], but the Complaint includes no Exhibit A. Defendants state that \nExhibit 1 to the Declaration of Janis Coughlin- Piester  [Doc. No. 61] is a true and correct copy of \nthe May 2, 2025 Policy Notice, s ee [Doc. No. 61 -1]. That version appears to have been accessed \nfrom the website on May 27, 2025, after the policy was stayed in connection with this lawsuit . \nSee id. at 1 ( noting that “NSF is temporarily pa using implementation of the [Policy Notice]” ).  Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 12 of 5213 \n ¶¶ 72–105 [Doc. No. 1]. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  violates \nauthorizing statutes (Count I), departs from negotiated indirect cost rates in violation of 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.414 (Count II), departs from cost recovery regulations (Count III), and is arbitrary and capricious (Count IV). Id. On May 8, Plaintiffs filed a combined Motion for a Preliminary \nInjunction and for Summary Judgment  [Doc. No. 40] supported by declarations from \nrepresentatives of the Organizational Plaintiffs  and their members,  and from the University \nPlaintiffs.  \nDefendants subsequently filed their own Motion for Summary Judgment  [Doc. No. 60] , \narguing that Plaintiffs have not demonstrated standing to sue, that this court lacks jurisdiction because NSF’s grant -related decisions are committed to agency discretion by law and are not \nreviewable under the APA, and that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  is authorized by statute and \nsupported by reasoned explanation. Defendants’ Motion is supported by a declaration from the \nNSF’s Chief Financial Officer and Head of the Office of  Budget, Finance, and Award \nManagement . \nDefendants have agreed to voluntar ily stay  implementation of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  \nthrough June 20, 2025. See Defs. ’ Notice [Doc. No. 50]; Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 42 n.30 [Doc. \nNo. 62].  \nIII. Standard of Review  \nIn the administrative law context, a motion for summary judgment is “ simply a vehicle to \ntee up a case for judicial review .” Bos. Redevelopment Auth. v. Nat ’l Park Serv. , 838 F.3d 42, \n47 (1st Cir. 2016) . Therefore, “ an inquiring court must review an agency action not to determine \nwhether a dispute of fact remains but, rather, to determine whether the agency action was arbitrary and capricious ” or otherwise unlawful. Id.; see Associated Fisheries of Maine, Inc. v. \nDaley , 127 F.3d 104, 109  (1st Cir. 1997)  (explaining court’s task on summary judgment in Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 13 of 5214 \n administrative law context “is only to determine” whether agency’s action was “consonant with \n[its] statutory powers, reasoned, and supported by substantial evidence in the record”).  \nIV. Discussion  \nA. Jurisdiction  \n1. Standing \nDefendant s argue that Plaintiffs lack standing because they have not established that any \nPlaintiff has suffered an injury in fact. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 12 [Doc. No. 62]. Defendants \ncontend that because the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  applies only to new awards, any injury \nPlaintiffs can identify stems from potentially being offered a grant award at the 15%  indirect cost \nrate (which they would have discretion to accept or reject), submitting proposals at that rate in the future, or deciding not to submit grant proposals at that rate. Id. at 13. Defendants assert that \nclaims concerning hypothetical, future grants that Plaintiffs may or may not receive constitute \ngeneralized grievances about NSF’s policy, which are not sufficient to confer standing. Id. \nThe doctrine of standing is rooted in Article III of the Constitution, which confines \nfederal courts to the adjudication of actual “cases” and “controversies.” See  U.S. Const. a rt. III, § \n2, cl. 1; TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , 594 U.S. 413, 423 (2021) . “For a legal dispute to qualify \nas a genuine case or controversy, at least one plaintiff must have standing to sue.” Dep ’t of Com. \nv. New York , 588 U.S. 752, 766 (2019) .  \nEstablish ing standing requires a showing that a plaintiff “ has suffered, or will suffer, an \ninjury that is ‘[1] concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; [2] fairly traceable to the challenged action; and [3] redressable by a favorable ruling.’ ” Murthy v. Missouri , 603 U.S. 43, \n57 (2024)  (quoting Clapper v. Amnesty Int ’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 409 (2013) ).  \n“[A]n association may have standing solely as the representative of its members even in \nthe absence of injury to itself [.]” Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 14 of 5215 \n Goods Corp., 799 F.2d 6,  10 (1st Cir. 1986) . “[A] n association has standing to bring suit on \nbehalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own \nright; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization ’s purpose; and (c) \nneither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit. ” Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advert. Comm ’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 \n(1977) ; see also  Warth v. Seldin , 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975) (“The association must allege that its \nmembers, or any one of them, are suffering immediate or threatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves brought suit.” ). \nWhether an association has standing to sue  on behalf of its members “ depends in \nsubstantial measure on the nature of the relief sought.”  Int’l Union, United Auto., Aerospace & \nAgr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 287 (1986)  (quoting Warth , 422 U.S. at  \n515). Actions seeking  prospective relief are generally “ particularly suited to group \nrepresentation .” Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst. , 799 F.2d at 12.  \nTo establish the first element of standing, an injury- in-fact, a plaintiff must demonstrate \n“an invasion of a legally protected interest” that is “not conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan  v. \nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) . “[A] person exposed to a risk of future harm \nmay pursue forward -looking, injunctive relief to prevent the harm from occurring, at least so \nlong as the risk of harm is sufficiently imminent and substantial .” TransUnion, 594 U.S. at 435.  \nHere, P laintiffs have  sufficiently  demonstrated that University Plaintiffs  and the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs have standing based on an imminent and substantial future injury to \nIHEs . Qualifying for less federal funding is a “future injur[y]” that is sufficient to confer \nstanding where “t he threatened injury is certainly impending, or there is a substantial risk that the Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 15 of 5216 \n harm will occur .” Dep ’t of Com ., 588 U.S. at 767; accord  New Jersey v. Trump, 131 F.4th 27, 37 \n(1st Cir. 2025) ; cf. Sherley v. Sebelius , 610 F.3d 69, 74 (D.C. Cir. 2010)  (concluding plaintiffs \nhad standing where agency action increased competition for federal grants such that plaintiffs \n“face[d] a substantial enough probability [of losing funding] to deem the injury to them \nimminent”) . Under the 15% Indirect Cost Rate , Organizational Plaintiffs  and member \ninstitutions , including the University Plaintiffs, w ill have to cover a significant portion of their \nindirect costs for NSF research  despite ONR  and HHS’s recognition of thos e actual,  indirect \ncosts, as reflected in the negotiated indirect  cost rates. Defendants  provide an example that  \nillustrates: If NSF awards $100 in direct costs to an institution with whom ONR  or HHS has \nnegotiated a 30 % indirect cost rate, the total award is $130. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 29 [Doc. No. \n62]. But if NSF caps  the indirect cost rate at 15 %, the institution can only receive $15 in indirect \ncosts  from the same grant award , for a total award of $115, with the institution responsible for \ncovering the remaining $15. See id. \nPlaintiffs  have also demonstrated that this  injury is sufficiently imminent. Even though \nthe 15% Indirect Cost Rate  only c uts indirect costs as to future grants that NSF has not yet \nawarded , any IHE that has negotiated an indirect cost rate with HHS or ONR  above 15% \nbecomes eligible  for less federal funding if NSF implements  the 15% Indirect Cost Rate .  \nNor is  it merely hypothetical that at least some University Plaintiffs and members of the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs institutions will receive less indirect cost funding from NSF under the 15% Indirect Cost Rate . Although no university is guaranteed to receive any grant award for \nwhich it applies, some University Plaintiffs (who are also members of the Organizational Plaintiffs ) each have dozens of proposals pending, and NSFs average approval rate for grant \nproposals from IHEs was 27% . Coughlin- Piester Decl.  ¶ 9 [Doc. No. 61]. Such institutions are Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 16 of 5217 \n highly likely to receive at least a portion of the awards for which they have applied. Further, \nwhere members of the Organizational Plaintiffs received approximately $14.4 billion in awards in 2023, and where IHEs have received 80% of grants historically, the suggestion that no University Plaintiff or member of an Organizational Plaintiff would be awarded any grant  in the \nfuture is fanciful. Indeed, Defendants themselves point out that “[r]eview of awards from 2024 \ncan illustrate the impact of the policy on  future awards . . . . If indirect  costs had been limited to \n15% for IHEs in FY24, then, at the time of award, the budgeted indirect costs would have been $432,298,644 less.” Id. ¶ 18. Given the magnitude of awards to members of the Organizational \nPlaintiffs, it is highly likely that some members would be among the institutions affected.  \nFurther , Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  will cause  a host of \nadditional injuries, beginning with a disruption to ongoing research. Although the 15% Indirect Cost Rate  does not affect existing or continuing grant awards, Plaintiffs and member institutions \ncollectively have thousands of proposals pending before NSF, which they submitted in reliance on their negotiated indirect cost rates.

These grants are forthcoming to IHEs because, unless the \nDOE intends to stop funding this type of research, they must be. The [15% Indirect \nCost Rate]  itself manife sts an intent on the [agency’s]  part to continue funding \nIHEs; all that has changed is that the [agency]  now wants IHEs to foot more of the \nbill, without regard to the individual circumstances and overhead costs of each IHE, which Plaintiffs have adequately established they cannot do.  \nDep’t of E nergy, 2025 WL 1414135, at *19. Here, Plaintiffs and member institutions have \nlongstanding funding relationships with NSF, and the agency has long accepted their negotiated \nindirect cost rates. IHEs have made long -term financial commitments, developed research \ninfrastructure, a nd engaged in multi -year budgeting processes in reliance on that relationship. \nSee, e.g., Caltech Decl. ¶  17 [Doc. No. 40- 8]; Dartmouth Decl. ¶  10 [Doc. No. 40- 15]; Florida \nDecl. ¶  17 [Doc. No. 40 -16]; UIC Decl. ¶  18 [ Doc. No. 40- 17]; Michigan Decl. ¶  16 [Doc. No. \n40-20]; UNR Decl. ¶  17 [Doc. No. 40- 22]; UNH Decl. ¶  16 [Doc. No. 40- 23]. Given that NSF \nhas long accepted IHEs’ negotiated indirect cost rates, it is reasonable for Plaintiffs and member institutions to rely on that policy in research planning and development. And because those institutions have developed infrastructure to support NSF res earch, they can expect to receive \nNSF funding in the future, even if they are not guaranteed a particular award.  \nNor are Plaintiffs’ injuries merely “downstream consequences ” of the 15% Indirect Cost \nRate. See Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot . 38 [Doc. No. 62]. Instead, the lost opportunities and disruption \noccurs with the implementation of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate. Plaintiffs have thus demonstrated irreparable harm without an adequate remedy at law.   \nPlaintiffs have also shown that the balance of hardships and the public interest weigh in \nfavor of awarding equitable relief. Plaintiffs and member institutions engage in research aimed at improving human health and quality of life in addition to advancing this country’s energy, Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 48 of 5249 \n economic, and national security. See, e.g. , AAU Decl. ¶  4 [Doc. No. 40 -1]; ACE Decl. ¶  7 [Doc. \nNo. 40- 2]; APLU Decl. ¶  6 [Doc. No. 40- 3]. Whatever the Executive’s views may be about what  \nsort of research advances the United States’ economic or national security interests, Defendants \ndo not suggest that diminishing or discontinuing NSF -funded research at IHEs is in the public \ninterest, particularly where the 15% Indirect Cost Rate’s stated  goals to “[i]ncreas[e] the \nproportion of federal funds allocated to direct research costs” and allow “NSF and its awardees to focus more on scientific progress [.]” NSF Policy Notice: Implementation of Standard 15% \nIndirect Cost Rate , NSF 25 -034. And where IHEs —through their NSF -funded research —impact \ntheir local and regional communities via employment and innovation that attracts additional spending and investment, halting or disrupting such research will have negative impacts on those communities. See, e.g. , APLU Decl. ¶  14 [Doc. No. 40- 3]; UC Decl. ¶  15 [Doc. No. 40- 7]; \nMinnesota Decl. ¶  19 [Doc. No. 40- 21]; Vanderbilt Decl. ¶  17 [Doc. No. 40- 37].  \nDefendants argue that injunctive relief is not in the public interest where an injunction \nwould force the United States to pay out funds that it may not be able to recover. Mem. ISO Defs.’ Mot. 42 [Doc. No. 62]. Defendants cite Department of Education v. California , which \nconcerned a temporary restraining order enjoining the government from terminating grants and requiring it to pay out past -due grant obligations. 604 U.S. __, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025) . In \ncontrast, where the court’s determination is a fin al judgment, not a preliminary injunction, and \nwhere NSF has not terminated or reduced the amount of any existing or continuing grants, equitable relief merely prevents NSF from continuing an unlawful policy. “T here is generally no \npublic interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.” League of Women Voters of \nUnited States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) . Relatedly, “[i] t is well established that \nthe Government ‘ cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.’” Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 49 of 5250 \n See C.G.B. v. Wolf , 464 F. Supp. 3d 174, 218 (D.D.C. 2020)  (quoting Open Cmties. Alliance v. \nCarson , 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. 2017) ). Accordingly, the public interest and balance \nof hardships favor equitable relief.  \nMoreover, nationwide relief is necessary. Associations may pursue relief that “will inure \nto the benefit of those members of the association actually injured[ .]”Int’l Union, United Auto., \nAerospace & Agr. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 288 (1986)  (quoting \nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515 (1975) ). Where two of the Organizational Plaintiffs represent \ninstitutions in every state, APLU Decl. ¶ ¶ 3, 5 [Doc. No. 40- 3]; ACE Decl. ¶  3 [Doc. No. 40 -2], \nnationwide relief is necessary to prevent mem ber institutions from suffering harm. Relatedly, \nwhere Plaintiffs and member institutions are dispersed throughout the United States, nationwide \nrelief avoids the “‘ chaos and confusion’ of a patchwork of [relief],” which impacts NSF as well \nas IHEs. See NIH , 770 F. Supp. 3d at 327 (quoting Florida v. Dep’ t of Health & Hum. Servs., 19 \nF.4th 1271, 1281–82 (11th Cir. 2021) ); id. at 328–29 (explaining a “ patchwork of injunctions \nwould cause administrability problems, not only for the institutions relying on consistency to prevent the harm discussed above but also for NIH as it attempts to comply with varying injunctions across the country”) . \nNonetheless, Plaintiffs have not established that injunctive relief is necessary. “ An \ninjunction is a drastic and extraordinary remedy, which should not be granted as a matter of course. ” Monsanto, 561 U.S. 139 at  166 (citations omitted). “If a less drastic remedy (such as \npartial or complete . . . vacatur of [the agency’s ] decision) [is] sufficient to redress respondents’ \ninjury, no recourse to the additional and extraordinary relief of an injunction [is] warranted.” Id. \n165–66 (internal citations omitted) . Case 1:25-cv-11231-IT     Document 77     Filed 06/20/25     Page 50 of 5251 \n Here, vacatur of the 15% Indirect Cost Rate and a judgment declaring it unlawful will \nprovide the Plaintiffs complete relief.8 Where the 15% Indirect Cost Rate causes Plaintiffs to \nsuffer the harms described above, vacating the Policy redresses those injuries. See Action on \nSmoking & Health v. C.A.B., 713 F.2d 795, 797 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“ To ‘vacate []’ . . . means ‘ to \nannul; to cancel or rescind; to declare, to make, or to render, void; to defeat; to deprive of force; \nto make of no authority or validity; to set aside.’”) (quoting 91 C.J.S. Vacate (1955) ). And \nbecause vacatur voids and rescinds the Policy itself, it provides nationwide relief that redresses injuries suffered by members of the Organizational Plaintiffs. Enjoining Defendants from implementing or enforcing a policy that has been vacated would be duplicative.  \nA declaratory judgment obviates the need to enjoin defendants from reimplementing a \nsubstantively identical policy where a declaratory judgment declares the rights and obligations of the parties and has “the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201( a); \nUnion de Empleados de Muelles de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Int ’l Longshoremen’ s Ass’ n, 884 F.3d \n48, 58 (1st Cir. 2018)  (explaining purpose of declaratory judgment “ is to determine the rights \nand obligations of the parties so that they can act in accordance with the law ”). Indeed, \n“[b]ecause ‘[a] declaratory judgment is binding on the parties before the court and is res judicata \nin subsequent proceedings as to the matters declared,’  it can be used by a party to later obtain \nfurther relief. ” Id. (quoting Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Cardoza -Rodriguez , 133 F.3d 111, 122 n.11 (1st \nCir. 1998) ). To the extent Plaintiffs seek to ensure Defendants do not otherwise unlawfully \n \n \n8 To be clear, a permanent injunction would be warranted, if despite foregoing the argument \nhere, Defendants successfully contend on appeal that vacatur is not available under the APA.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In \"United States v. Santos Rene Soto and Santos Moises Soto,\" the defendants, involved with AI company GoldenSpear and its subsidiary AI Health, were charged with multiple fraud schemes, including wire fraud and bank fraud, related to false representations about their companies. They attempted to dismiss or sever charges, arguing violations like duplicity (distinct offenses charged in a single count) and vagueness, and sought severance of certain counts for separate trials. The court mostly denied their motions except to strike vague language from one count, emphasizing that the charges could be construed as a single conspiracy related to AI and healthcare false claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the indictment's fraud-related charges are appropriately joined as part of a single conspiracy without being impermissibly duplicative or vague, and whether certain counts should be severed for trial fairness.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied most of the defendants' motions, upholding the indictment's structure as suitable for trial, save for striking unspecified \"among other things\" terms for lack of clarity, indicating possible reconsideration on severance closer to trial.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine two people run companies that make a big deal about developing cool AI tech for fashion and healthcare but are really just faking it to get money from investors and banks. They are caught and say the charges against them are unfair because they mix up different schemes and aren't clear enough. The judge mostly disagrees, saying the charges are fine to try together because it's all really one big fake scheme story, but does tell the government to be clearer on one part, and might let them re-address having separate trials later.",

They first move to dismiss Counts One and Two of  their indictment (the \n“Indictment”) because they believe these counts violate the Rule Against Duplicity  and are \nimpermissibly vague .  They also seek to strike the non -disclosure theory of fraud from Counts \nOne through Five of the Indictment on the basis that they are inadequately pleaded , and the \n“among other things” language in Count One for vagueness .  Finally, they seek to sever Counts \nSix and Seven from this case, as well as from each other, so that Santos Soto can provide \npotentially exculpatory testimony at Saints Soto’s trial.  \n The defendants ’ motions are DENIED , except for the motion to strike the “among other \nthings” language in Count One, which is GRANTED .  Their motion to dismiss claim fails because \nconspiracy charges are routinely found not to violate the Rule Against Duplicity.  The ir motion to \nstrike the non -disclosure theory of fraud similarly  fails, as the government provides enough facts \nin the Indictment to properly support their theory .  As for the motion to sever, I believe the record \nneeds to be further developed before deciding this matter.  I decline to sever the defendants’ \nclaims at this time but will reconsider this issue closer to trial .

Indictment (“Indict.”) [Dkt. No. 1] ¶ 1.  He is also the CEO of AI Health, “a \nsubsidiary of GoldenSpear that purports to be an AI technology company focused on healthcare \nand founded in approximately 2021.”  Id. ¶ 3.  Santos Soto is the father of Saints Soto and serves \non the board of directors for GoldenSpear.  Id. ¶ 2.  Both defendants hold “joint ownership of and \ncontrol over, and [are] signatories for,” bank accounts belonging to GoldenSpear and AI Health.  \nId. ¶¶ 4–5. \nThe government alleges that the Sotos conspired to defraud investors and banks by making \nfalse representations about their companies, resulting in three fraudulent events —the \n“GoldenSpear” incident, occurring from March 2017 to May 2019; the “AI Health” in cident, \noccurring from March 2021 to April 2022; and the “PPP loan” incident, occurring from April \n2020 to May 2020 (together, the “three schemes”).  See Indict. ¶¶ 34 –50. Counts One and Two of \nthe Indictment are related to all three schemes, while Counts Three through Seven are each only \nconnected to one of the three schemes.  See id.   The schem es as alleged in the Indictment are \nsummarized below.  \n1. The GoldenSpear Fraud  \nIn 2017, defendants told investors and potential investors that GoldenSpear was an “AI \ncompany with a focus on fashion and retail,” and that the company had created an “AI Fashion \nAssistant that used visual and textual algorithms to help retailers identify  specific fashion brands \nand types of clothing that potential customers might want to purchase .”  Id. ¶ 13 ( internal \nquotations omitted ).  To induce potential investors to finance GoldenSpear, Saints Soto allegedly \nmade misrepresentations that the company “entered into contracts with, had discussed investments \nfrom or acquisitions by, or was otherwise working with numerous established entities.”  Id. ¶ 14.  \nOne investor Saints Soto communicated with was “T.G.”  Id. ¶ 15.  In January 2018, Saints \nSoto told T.G. that “GoldenSpear was ‘selected’ by a prominent car manufacturer to power a \nglobal intelligent Dealership Network,” despite never having been selected to perform work for Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 2 of 23 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  the company.  Id. (cleaned up).  He also represented to T.G. that a “prominent financial firm” took \nGoldenSpear on a “roadshow” to meet with prominent technology companies, who offered to \ninvest in GoldenSpear.  Id. ¶ 16.  But the roadshow and offers were allegedly a lie made up by \nSaints Soto.  Id.  Influenced by these misrepresentations, T.G. invested approximately $300,000 in \nGoldenSpear between February 2018 and May 2019.  Id. ¶ 17.  \n2. The AI Health Fraud  \nWhen the COVID -19 pandemic exploded in March 2020, the “purported business model of \nGoldenSpear, which the defendants told investors involved brick -and-mortar stores, became \nuntenable.”  United States’ Opposition to Motions to Strike, Dismiss, and Sever (“ Oppo.”) [Dkt. \nNo. 83] at 6.  As a result, defendants “began to represent to potential investors that GoldenSpear \nwas moving from the fashion sector to the health sector.”  Indict. ¶ 18.  Such representations \nincluded that AI Health developed a “wearable de vice that, using artificial intelligence, could \ndetect the presence of the COVID -19 virus in the wearer of the device.”  Id. \nAround March 2021, Saints Soto sent to investor J.B. a presentation that stated AI Health \n“gifted” its technology to a high school in Los Angeles, California, despite never sending such \nitems.  Id. ¶ 19.  At the same time, Saints Soto told J.B. that a “prominent accounting and violation \nfirm had conducted a valuation of AI Health and . . . valued the company at more than $100 \nmillion.”  Id. (cleaned up).   He also represented that he was collaborating with a children’s \nhospital in Los Angeles to study patient health data in connection with the COVID -19 pandemic.  \nId.  Both of these claims were false.  Id.  Influenced by these misrepresentations, J.B. invested \napproximately $250,000 in AI Health in May 2021.   Id. ¶ 21.  \nSaints Soto made the same misrepresentations to potential investor E.C. in 2022, along \nwith new claims that AI Health entered a contract with a prominent medical device company to \nassist with a diabetes prevention study being conducted in Guam.  Id. ¶¶ 23 –24.  As a result, E.C. \ninvested approximately $2.67 million in AI Health.  Id. ¶ 25.  \n3. The PPP Loan Fraud  \nIn March 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security \n(“CARES”) Act, which created an emergency loan system called the Paycheck Protection Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 3 of 23 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Program (“PPP”).  Id. ¶ 7.  The PPP sought to provide $300 billion to “small businesses for job \nretention and certain other expenses” during the COVID -19 pandemic.  Id. ¶ 7.  To qualify for a \nPPP loan, businesses were required to submit a form application stating their (1) monthly payroll \nexpenses and (2) number of employees.  Id. ¶ 8.  Loans would then be calculated based on these \nnumbers, and proceeds were required to be spent on “certain permissible expenses,” including \n“payroll costs, interest on mortga ges, rent, and utilities.”  Id. ¶¶ 8, 11.  \nOn April 20, 2020, GoldenSpear applied for an PPP loan.  Id. ¶ 27.  On its application, \nGoldenSpear listed the person submitting the application as “Santos Soto.”1  Id. ¶ 28.  The form \nincluded Santos Soto’s email and home addresses but listed Saint s Soto’s social security number \nand birthdate.  Id. ¶¶ 28, 33.  In the application, defendants indicated that the monthly payroll for \nGoldenSpear was $267,899.16, and that GoldenSpear had thirty -three employees working in the \nUnited States.  Id. ¶ 29.  Defendants certified that the information they provided was true and \naccurate.  Id.  In reality, GoldenSpear only had seven or eight employees working in the United \nStates, and their average monthly payroll was between $57,000 to $67,000.  Id. ¶ 32.  Based on  the \nnumbers they provided, defendants received a loan for $669,700, which was later wired to the \nGoldenSpear bank account.  Id. ¶ 30. \nDefendants also stated in their application that the PPP loan would be used to pay \nGoldenSpear’s $18,000 per month commercial lease.  Id. ¶ 33.  However, the address the \ndefendants provided was Santos Sotos’ private residence; the loan was never used to pay for a \ncommercial lease.  Id.   \n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nOn September 28, 2022, the United States filed the Indictment against defendants in the \nNorthern District of California, bringing seven charges against them: (1) Conspiracy, in violation \nof 18 U.S.C. § 371; (2) Wire Fraud Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S .C. § 1349; (3) Wire Fraud, \nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (GoldenSpear fraud  with victim “T.G.”); (4) bank fraud under 18 \nU.S.C. § 1343 (AI Health fraud  with victim “J.B.”); (5) Wire Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § \n \n1 Because both defendants have “Santos Soto” in their names —Santos Moises Soto III and Santos \nRenee Soto —the Indictment does not identify which defendant submitted the application.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 4 of 23 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  1343 (AI Health fraud  with victim “E.C.”); (6) Bank Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344(2) \n(PPP Fraud); and (7) False Statement on a Loan Application, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 10104 \n(PPP Fraud).  See Indict.  \nIn response to the Indictment, defendants filed three motions.  Saints Soto filed a motion \nseeking to dismiss Counts One and Two of the Indictment for violating the Rule of Duplicity, or, \nin the alternative, a motion requesting a bill of particulars for Count Two.  See Defendant Soto \nIII’s Motion  to Dismiss Counts One and Two of Indictment, and as to Count Two in the \nAlternative for a Bill of Particulars (“Dismiss Mot.”) [Dkt. 72].2  He also  filed a second motion \nseeking to strike the “non -disclosure” theory of prosecution from Counts One through Five of the \nIndictment.  See Defendant Soto III’s Motion to Strike “Non -Disclosure” Theory of Prosecution \n(“Strike Mot.”) [Dkt. 73].  Santos Soto filed two motions , requesting that he be joined to Saints \nSoto’s respective motions.  See Dkt. Nos. 75, 76.  \nA few days later , Saints Soto filed a third motion to sever Counts Six and Seven  from th eo \nother counts , as well as from each other .  See Motion to Sever Defendant on Counts Six and Seven \nfrom Trial and All Other Counts (“Sever Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 79].  Santos Soto filed a declaration in \nsupport of Saints Soto’s motion to sever.  See Administrative Motion to File Under Seal (“Sealed \nMot.”) [Dkt. No. 78] Declaration of Santos Moises Soto, III (“Saints Soto Decl.”) [Dkt. No. 78 -1].  \nHe then filed a request to join Saints Soto’s severance motion .  See Dkt. No. 80.  \nThe United States responded to all three motions in a single opposition.  See Oppo.   \nDefendants subsequently filed three replies.  They filed two responses regarding the motion to \ndismiss and motion to strike claims.  See Defendants’ Reply on Motion to Dismiss (“Dismiss \nRepl.”) [Dkt. No. 86]; Defendants’ Reply on Motion to Strike (“Strike Repl.”) [Dkt. No. 87].  \nThree days later, they  filed their reply in support of the severance motion.  See Reply Brief in \nSupport of Motion to Sever Trial (“Sever Repl.”) [Dkt. No. 89].  \n \n \n \n2 Defendants withdrew their request for a bill of particulars at oral argument , as the government \nclarified that the scope of Count Two is the same as Count One.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 5 of 23 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  LEGAL STANDARD  \nMotion to Dismiss ; Motion to Strike  \nReview of an indictment on a motion to challenge the sufficiency of the pleading is \ngoverned by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c), which provides that an indictment must \ncontain a “plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts  constituting the \noffense charged.”  Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1).  In considering a motion to dismiss an indictment, \ndistrict courts are limited to the “four corners of the indictment ” in analyzing whether a cognizable \noffense has been charged.  United States  v. Boren , 278 F.3d 911, 914 (9th Cir. 2002).  An \nindictment “should be read in its entirety, construed according to common sense, and interpreted \nto include facts which are necessarily implied.”  United States v. Berger , 473 F.3d 1080, 1103 (9th \nCir. 2007) (quotation and citation omitted).   \n“Because it is a drastic step, dismissing an indictment is a disfavored remedy.”  United \nStates v. Rogers , 751 F.2d 1074, 1076 (9th Cir. 1985).  As a result, an indictment will withstand a \ndefendant’s motion to dismiss so long as it “contains the elements of the charged offense in \nsufficient detail (1) to enable the defendant to prepare his defense; (2) to en sure him that he is \nbeing prosecuted on the basis of the facts presented to the grand jury; (3) to enable him to plead \ndouble jeopardy; and (4) to info rm the court of the alleged facts so that it can determine the \nsufficiency of the charge.”  United States v. Rosi , 27 F.3d 409, 414 (9th Cir. 1994) (citation \nomitted).  \nMotion to Sever  \nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a), joinder of two or more offenses may occur \nwhen the offenses charged are “of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or \ntransaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common sch eme or plan.”  Fed. R. Crim. \nP. 8(a).  Only one of the three prongs must be met for joinder to be proper.  See id. ; United States \nv. Jawara , 474 F.3d 565, 578 (9th Cir. 2007).  That is because joinder “is the rule, severance the \nexception.”  United States v. Free , 841 F.2d 321, 324 n.1 (9th Cir. 1988).  But these factors are \n“not infinitely elastic,” and there must be a “valid basis for joinder . . . discernible from the face of \nthe indictment.”  Jawara , 474 F.3d at 473 (citing United States v. Randazzo , 80 F.3d 623, 627 (1st Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 6 of 23 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Cir. 1996) ). \nEven if joinder is proper under Rule 8(a), district courts may sever a claim or defendant if \njoinder “prejudice[s] a defendant or the government.”  Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(a).  In general, courts \nprefer that “defendants who are indicted together” are also trie d jointly.  Zafiro v. United States , \n506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993).  But severance is appropriate under Rule 14(a) “if there is a serious risk \nthat a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or [would] \nprevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.”  United States v. \nStinson , 647 F.3d 1196, 1205 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting Zafiro , 506 U.S. at 539).  “When the reason \nfor severance is the need for a codefendant’s testimony, the threshold showing required of the \ndefendant is (1) that he would call the defendant at a severed trial, (2) that the codefendant would \nin fact testify, and (3) that the t estimony would be favorable to the moving party.”  United States \nv. Reese , 2 F.3d 870, 892 (9th Cir. 1993) (cit ing United States v. Hernandez , 952 F.2d 1110, 1115 \n(9th Cir. 199 1), cert. denied , 506 U.S. 920 (1992)) (cleaned up).   \nDISCUSSION  \nI. MOTION TO DISMISS  \nDefendants seek to dismiss Counts One and Two on the grounds that they violate the Rule \nAgainst Duplicity and are impermissibly vague.   Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a), \nan indictment may charge a defendant with two or more offenses in a singular count only “if the \noffenses charged —whether felonies or misdemeanors or both —are of the same or similar \ncharacter, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a \ncommon scheme or plan.”  Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a ).  An indictment does not violate the Rule Against \nDuplicity if a one count charges a “conspiracy to commit more than one offense.”  United States v. \nSmith , 891 F.2d 703, 713 (9th Cir. 1989), as amended , 906 F.2d 385 (9th Cir. 1990) (citing \nBraverman v. United States , 317 U.S. 49, 54 (1942)).  But a conspiracy does violate the Rule if a \nsingle count charges multiple, distinct conspiracies.  See United States v. Gordon , 844 F.2d 1397, \n1401 (9th Cir. 1988).  \nThe parties primarily dispute whether the GoldenSpear, AI Health, and PPP loan schemes \nshould be considered as one conspiracy or three distinct conspiracies.  They agree that if the three Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 7 of 23 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  schemes are considered independent conspiracies, Counts One and Two would violate the Rule \nAgainst Duplicity.  Conversely, should I find that the schemes are part of one conspiracy, the Rule \nAgainst Duplicity would not apply, and Counts One and Two would b e properly alleged.  \na. Count One Does Not Violate the Rule Against Duplicity.  \nCount One charges the Sotos with conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371.  Indict. ¶¶ 34 –37.  \nSpecifically, the Indictment alleges:  \n35. Beginning no later than in or about March 2017, and continuing \nuntil at least in or about May 2022, in the Northern District of \nCalifornia and elsewhere, [defendants] did knowingly conspire to \ncommit offenses against the United States, namely devising and \nintending to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud as to a material \nmatter and to obtain money and property by means of materially \nfalse and fraudulent pretenses, representations, and promises, and \nby concealment of material facts, and, for the purpo se of executing \nsuch scheme and artifice and attempting to do so, did transmit and \ncause to be transmitted, by means of wire communication in \ninterstate and foreign commerce, certain writings, signs, signals, \npictures, and sounds, in violation of Title 18,  United States Code, \nSection 1343.  \n \n36. The objectives of the conspiracy were, among other things, (a) \nto obtain investment funds in GoldenSpear and AI Health from \ninvestors using false and misleading statements, and omissions of \nmaterial facts; (b) to obtain funds from a PPP loan to Lender 1 using \nfalse and misleading statements, and omissions of material facts.  \n \n37. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to effect the objects thereof, \nin the Northern District of California and elsewhere, [defendants] \nand others committed the following overt acts:  \n \na. On or about January 17, 2018, SAINTS SOTO wrote an \nemail to T.G. that contained false and misleading statements, \nincluding falsely stating that GoldenSpear had been “selected” by \nCar Manufacturer 1 to “power a global intelligent Dealership \nNetwork” and fal sely stat ing that Financial Firm 1 had taken \nGoldenSpear on a “roadshow” to meet prominent technology \ncompanies in 2017 and that many of the technology companies \n“made known their interest to make an acquisition and/or an \ninvestment.”  \n \nb. On or about April 20, 2020, SANTOS SOTO and SAINTS \nSOTO submitted a PPP loan application to Lender 1 that included \nfalse statements including, but not limited to, the number of Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 8 of 23 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  GoldenSpear employees based in the United States, how much \nGoldenSpear paid its United States -based employees, and \nGoldenSpear’s commercial office space expenditures.  \n \nc. On or about January 6, 2022, SANTOS SOTO wrote an \nemail to E.C. that contained false and misleading statements, \nincluding  providing  a contract purporting to be a finalized \nagreement between Medical Device Company 1 and AI Health that \nwas not.  \nId. ¶¶ 35 –37.   \nDefendants contend that the text and structure of Count One suggest that the three alleged \nschemes are independent conspiracies violating the Rule Against Duplicity.  See Dismiss Mot. at \n4.  They point out that Count One “expressly admits two distinct objectives” in Paragraph 36 —\nfirst, to “obtain investment funds in GoldenSpear and AI Health from investors”; and second, to \n“obtain funds from a PPP loan to Lender 1.”  See id. ; Indict. ¶ 36.  This, along with the \nincorporated introductory paragraphs “expressly distinguish[ing]” between the three schemes, \nsuggests to defendants that the Indictment understood these schemes as separate conspiracies.  \nDismiss Mot. at 4; see Indict. ¶¶ 13 –17 (discussing only the GoldenSpear incident); ¶¶ 18 –26 \n(discussing only the AI Health incident); ¶¶ 27 –33 (discussing only the PPP loan incident).  \nDefendants primarily rely on United States v. Gordon  to frame their analysis.  844 F.2d \n1397 (9th Cir. 1988).  In Gordon , the defendants were charged with one count of conspiracy to \ndefraud the United States  premised on two separate incidents —first, an agreement to “use inside \ninformation to secure government contracts . . . in return for payoffs”; and second, “to conceal, \ncover up; and obstruct an investigation . . . into that wrongdoing.”  844 F.2d at 1401.   The Ninth \nCircuit concluded that these two incidents were separate incidents, as no evidence suggested the \ndefendants “contemplated or discussed any plans for a coverup.”  Id.  Rather, it was only until one \nco-defendant was subpoenaed by a grand jury tha t the conspiracy to obstruct justice began.  See id.   \nIn so holding, the Ninth Circuit held that the “relevant factors in determining the existence of [one \nversus multiple circumstances] are [1] the nature of the scheme, [2] the identity of the participants, \n[3] the quality, frequency, and duration of each conspirator’s transactions, and [4] the \ncommonality of times and goals.”  Id. \nApplying Gordon ’s “relevant factors” analysis to this case, defendants assert  that Count Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 9 of 23 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  One is duplicative.  With respect to the “nature of the scheme” factor, they argue:  \n[I]t could not possibly have been anticipated at the time of the \ncommencement of the alleged GoldenSpear investor fraud scheme \nin March 2017 that three years later there would be a global COVID -\n19 pandemic starting in March 2020, let alone that a Paycheck \nProtection Program would subsequently be instituted to provide \nemergency financial assistance to those suffering the economic \neffects of that pandemic.  \nDismiss Mot. at 5.  They similarly assert that the “quality, frequency, and duration” and \n“commonality of time and goals” factors weigh against finding one single conspiracy, as each \nscheme involved “non -overlapping dates and distinct unrelated victims.”  Id. at 4–6.  Finally, \nwhile defendants were allegedly both involved in all three schemes, they claim this fact is \ninconclusive, as “involvement of identical conspirators in both conspiracies does not compel a \nfinding that a single conspiracy existed.”  Id. at 6 (citing United States v. Ziskin , 360 F.3d 934, 945 \n(9th Cir. 2003)).  \n Defendants’ reliance on Gordon  now is likely  misplaced.  As the  court  noted in United \nStates v. W.R. Grace : \nThe Gordon  court expressly stated that it was not considering an \nobjection to the form of the indictment, and made clear that \nobjections to the form were to be resolved pursuant to the “limited \nreview” test. Instead, the  Gordon  court was assessing whether the \ndefendants were subjected to the risk of a non -unanimous jury \nverdict. The relevant factors test it employed in making that \nassessment is markedly of a different character than the limited \nreview test associated with pretri al challenges for duplicity. This  \ndistinction is apparent from the  Gordon  court ’s application of the \nrelevant factors test, for which the court relied upon a review of the \nevidence at trial.  844 F.2d at 1401  (“The evidence does not show \nthat the parties contemplated or discussed any plans for a coverup.”). \nAt the pretrial stage, during which a challenge to the form of the \nindictment must be raised under  Rule 12(b)(2) , it is impossible for \nthe court to consider the evidence heard at trial.  \n429 F. Supp. 2d 1207, 1218 (D. Mont. 2006).  \n The “relevant factors” test, the court in W.R. Grace  concluded, applies in cases where the \ngovernment charges a single conspiracy but the defendant “alleges a variance between the charge \nand the proof at trial  because the proof has shown that the conduct charged constitutes more than Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 10 of 23 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  one conspiracy.”  Id. (emphasis added).  By contrast, the court in W.R. Grace  found that a “limited \nreview” test applies to duplicity challenges for indictments at the pre -trial stage.  See id.   This \n“limited review” test requires district courts to “solely . . . assess whether the indictment itself can \nbe read to charge only one violation in each count.”  Id. at 1219 (citing United States v. Martin , 4 \nF.3d 757, 759 (9th Cir. 1993)).  \n I agree with the W.R. Grace  court that a “limited review” test likely applies at this stage of \nthe proceeding.  The Gordon  test appears more applicable for post -trial considerations of the \nindictment, as more evidence has been presented and could be considered under the higher \nstandard of review.  At the pre -trial stage, however, less evidence is present for me to consider \nwhether the Indictment is duplicative .   \nApplying W.R. Grace to the Indictment , Count One would not be duplicative.  To start, the \nnamed conspirators remain the same in each overt act.  When “read in its entirety [and] construed \naccording to common sense,” the Indictment plausibly alleges that the COVID -19 pandemic did \nnot “discontinue [the conspiracy’s] initially agreed upon objective,” but rather allowed defendants \nto adapt the tools an d means by which they engaged in fraud.  Id.; Berger , 473 F.3d at 1103.  The \nIndictment explains defendants’ co nnections to GoldenSpear, as well as the purported incidents of \nfraud that spanned between 2017 and March 2020.  See Indict. ¶¶ 1 –4, 13 –17.  It then details how \n“after the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic, [defendants] began to represent to potential investors \nthat GoldenSpear was moving from the fashion sector to the health sector,” and created AI Health \nas a result.  See id.  ¶ 18.  Accordingly, the Indictment sufficiently tracks how the purported \nGoldenSpear fraud evolved into the AI Health scheme.  See id.  \n There also is a clear connection between the GoldenSpear and PPP loan incident s.  The \nIndictment explains that the PPP scheme was directly connected to GoldenSpear, as without the \ncompany, defendants could not apply for the loan.  See Indict. ¶¶ 27 –33.  By using false \ninformation about the state of GoldenSpear in 2020, defendants were able to successfully receive \n$669,770 in emergency loans that were ultimately wired to their jointly -held GoldenSpear bank \naccount.  Id. ¶ 31.  Count One then explains that d efendants are charged with a conspiracy to \ndefraud both investors and lenders due to their false representations and statements.  Id. ¶¶ 35 –37.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 11 of 23 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  With this information, the Indictment could reasonably be understood as charging only one \nconspiracy.  See Martin , 4 F.3d at 759.  \n Even assuming defendants are correct that Gordon  applies, Count One would not be \nduplicative .  Their  arguments are largely premised on the fact that the three schemes occurred in \ndistinct time periods and with distinct victims, and that defendants could not have anticipated the \nCOVID -19 pandemic —and thus the AI Health and PPP loan schemes —when entering t he \npurported GoldenSpear conspiracy in 2017.  See id.   I do not disagree that defendants could not \nhave anticipated the COVID -19 pandemic.  But a “single o verall agreement need not be \nmanifested by continuous activity,” and a “suspension of activities” does not necessarily “divide a \nconspiracy into more than one.”  United States v. Bloch , 696 F.2d 1213, 1215 (9th Cir. 1982) , \nabrogated on other grounds , United States v. Jimenez Recio , 537 U.S. 270, 277 (2003).   Rather, \nconspiracies are “presumed to continue unless there is affirmative evidence that the defendant \nabandoned, withdrew from, or disavowed the conspiracy or defeated its purpose.”  United States v. \nKrasn, 614 F.2d 1229, 1236 (9th Cir. 1980).  I agree with the government that the Indictment does \nnot suggest abandonment or withdrawal from the GoldenSpear conspiracy —rather, it shows \n“defendants were . . . committed to using misrepresentations about their bus iness enterprises to \nobtain money by means of wire communication.”  See Oppo. at 10.  While the tools and \ncircumstances admittedly changed, the “underlying objects of the agreement” plausibly appear to \nremain the same.  Id.  Accordingly, any temporal “ gaps” between the three schemes does not \nautomatically support finding duplicity.  \n Defendants also argue that the three schemes each had “different goals and distinct types of \ntransactions,” considering the GoldenSpear and AI Health schemes allegedly involved wire fraud, \nwhile the PPP loan scheme involved bank fraud.  Dismiss Mot. at 6;  see Indict. ¶ 36.  They claim \nthat this appears on the face of Count One, which divides the bank and wire fraud schemes into \n“two distinct objectives” of the conspiracy.  Dismiss Mot. at 4.  But again, while the means of the \nconspiracy may have differed o ver time, the overall goal —for defendants to obtain funds by using \nfalse and misleading statements about their companies —appears the same throughout the \nIndictment.  Count One can plausibly be read as alleging one conspiracy and is not duplicative.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 12 of 23 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  b. Count Two Does Not Violate the Rule Against Duplicity.  \nCount Two charges defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud.  See Indict. ¶¶ 38 –\n39.  Unlike Count One, Count Two provides a “bare -bones recitation of the charged statute” and \n“incorporates by reference” the introductory paragraphs and Count One.  See Dismiss Mot. at 8 –9.  \nBecause Count Two is largely coextensive with Count One, defendants conclude that if Count One \nis found duplicative, so must Count Two.  Id. at 9. \nAs explained above, the three alleged schemes are plausibly alleged as one conspiracy, \nmeaning Count One does not violate the Rule Against Duplicity.  Because Count Two directly \nincorporates Count One  and addresses the same scheme, it also does not violate the Rule Against \nDuplicity.  \n II.   MOTION TO STRIKE  \nA. Non-Disclosure Theory  \nDefendants request that I strike the “non -disclosure” theory of wire fraud from Counts One \nthrough Five of the Indictment.  I decline to do so.  The government has provided sufficient facts \nin their Indictment to support a prosecution under this theory.  \nTo begin, the parties agree that a wire fraud charge may be premised on either a theory of \naffirmative representation or of “non -disclosure.”  United States v. Shields , 844 F.3d 819, 822 (9th \nCir. 2016); see Strike Mot. at 2; Oppo. at 21.  They also agree that a “non -disclosure” theory can \nonly support a wire fraud charge “when there exists an independent duty that has been breached by \nthe person so charged.”  Eller v. Equi Trust Life Ins. Co. , 778 F.3d 1089, 1092 (9th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting United States v. Dowling , 739 F.2d 1445, 1449 (9th Cir. 1984), rev’d on other grounds , \n473 U.S. 207 (1985)).   Where the y disagree is whether the duty to disclose is an implied necessary \nelement of a wire fraud charge.   \nDefendants claim that when the government premises a wire fraud charge on a theory of \nnon-disclosure, it must include in the charges the “implied essential element of a duty to disclose.”  \nStrike Mot. at 1 –2; Eller , 778 F.3d at 1092.  T hey cite a string of cases striking down wire fraud \ncharges under a non -disclosure theory for a failure to plead a duty to disclose.  Id. at 2–3; see, e.g. , \nUnited States v. Lonich , No. 14 -cr-00139 -SI-1, 2016 WL 324039, at *6 –*8 (N.D. Cal. Jan. 27, Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 13 of 23 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2016); United States v. Sullivan , No. 20 -cr-0037 -WHO -1, 2022 WL 2317441, at *7 –*8 (N.D. Cal. \nJune 28, 2022); United States v. Galloway , No. CR 14 -607 PJH, 2016 WL 4269961, at *2 –*4 \n(N.D. Cal. Aug. 15, 2016).  And because the Indictment “fails to allege” this duty, defendants \nargue, charges under the non -disclosure theory must be dismissed.   Strike Mot. at 2; United States \nv. Du Bo , 186 F.3d 1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 1999).  \nIn response, the government claims that it is not necessary to allege a duty to disclose to \nprosecute a non -disclosure theory of wire fraud.  See Oppo. at 22 –23. They contend that the Ninth \nCircuit has not opined on the issue, and that defendants lack circuit authority supporting their \nclaim.  See id.   Assuming it is required, however, the government maintains that it has met its \nburden.  See id.  \nDefendants are correct that many courts require the government to assert a duty to disclose \nin wire fraud charges premised on a non -disclosure theory.  See Lonich , 2016 WL 324039, at *7 –\n*8.  In Lonich , for example, the defendants —the CEO and President of Sonoma Valley Bank \n(“SVB”), the Senior Vice President and Chief Loan Officer of SVB, and an attorney —were \naccused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud after convincing SVB to approve a loan that violated  \nthe bank’s legal lending limit.  Id. at *2.  The govern ment’s wire fraud claims were premised in \npart on a theory of non -disclosure.  See id.  at *7.  However, the “only specific omission alleged in \nthe indictment” was that the defendants “omitted the material fact” to SVB that the parties seeking \nthe loan were subjects of a criminal investigation.  Id.  Despite the specific allegations of non -\ndisclosure, the court concluded that the indictment failed to sufficiently allege that the defendants \nowed a duty to disclose information to the SVB.  See id.  at *8.  \nBut the government is also correct  that courts should construe indictments broadly when \ndetermining whether a duty to disclose has been included.  See United States v. Milovanovic , 678 \nF.3d 713, 723 –24 (9th Cir. 2012); United States v. Losch , 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103425, *7 (D. \nAriz. June 9, 2022); see also United States v. Shields , 844 F.3d 819, 822 –23 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(adopting Milovanovic to wire fraud charges).  In Losch , an indictment charging a CEO with wire \nfraud alleged that the defendant “was central to solicitation pitches,” “spoke directly and often \nwith potential investors,” and was “instrumental in soliciting investments into [his company].”  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 14 of 23 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103425, at *7  (cleaned up) .  Applying Milovanovic , the court  concluded \nthat these allegations alone were sufficient to support a duty to disclose theory, as the indictment \ndemonstrated  that the defendant had a “trusting relationship” with the victims, which caused them \nto “relax the care and vigilance [they] would ordinarily exercise.”  Id.3 \nAssuming that there is a duty to disclose, when reading the indictment “in its entirety, \nconstrued according to common sense, and interpreted to include facts which are necessarily \nimplied,” the government has met its burden.  United States v. Given s, 767 F.2d 574, 584 (9th Cir. \n1985).4  The Indictment alleges that defendants held influential positions within GoldenSpear and \nAI Health , just  like the CEO in Losch .  See Indict. ¶¶ 1, 3.  It also claims that the pair began using \ntheir statuses as “leaders in the company” to make false representations to multiple investors, who \nin turn relied on their claims as being “credible.”  Oppo. at 24; see Indict. ¶¶ 14 –26, 30 –32, 35, 39, \n41, 43, 45 –47.  As a result, the Indictment concludes that defendants built a “trusting relationship” \nwith the alleged victims, causing them to “relax the care and vigilance [they] would ordinarily \nexercise.”  See i d.; 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103425, at *6 (cleaned up).  Accordingly, under Losch \nand Milovanovic , the Indictment properly pleads enough facts to support a non -disclosure theory \nof wire fraud.  See id.   Defendants’ motion to strike the non -disclosure theory is DENIED.  \nc. “Among Other Things”  \nDefendants also request that I strike the “vague phrase ‘among other things’ from Count \nOne (paragraph 36) because it permits the prosecution to achieve a conviction based on facts and \n \n3 Defendants argue that Losch  is not controlling because it does “not cite authority from any \njurisdiction in support of its conclusion that the element of a duty to disclose need not be pleaded \nin an indictment charging wire fraud under a non -disclosure theory.”  Strike Repl. at 3 n. 3.  To the \ncontrary, Losch directly cites the holding in Milovanovic  that evidence of an informal, “trusting \nrelationship” where the defendant “induces the trusting party to relax the care and vigilance which \nit would ordinarily exercise” is enough to support a non -disclosure theory under Federal Rule of \nCriminal Procedure  7(c)(1).  See 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103425, at *6 –*7; 678 F.3d at 724; Fed. \nR. Crim. P. 7(c)(1).  \n  \n4 Defendants maintain that Givens  is superseded by United States v. Du Bo , which held that “an \nindictment’s complete failure to recite an essential element of the charged offense is not a minor or \ntechnical flaw subject to harmless error analysis, but a fatal flaw requiring dismissal of the \nindictment.”  See Strike Repl. at 2 n.2; 186 F.3d 1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 1999).  I do not read these \ncases to be mutually exclusive.  While Du Bo focuses on when  courts may dismiss an improperly \nalleged indictment, Givens  explains how an indictment should be read to determine the sufficiency \nof the claims.  Givens is good law and must be followed.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 15 of 23 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  theories not found by the grand jury, which would violate the Fifth Amendment.”  Dismiss  Mot. at \n8.  The government d id not squarely address this issue in its opposition.  \nTo support their argument, defendants  cite to Lonich , which concluded that the language \n“among other things” in an indictment “adds nothing to the charges, gives the defendants no \nfurther information with respect to them, and creates the danger that the prosecutor at trial may \nimpermissibly enlarge the char ges in the Indictment returned by the grand jury.”  2016 WL \n324039, at *6 (quoting United States v. DePalma , 461 F. Supp. 778, 798 –99 (S.D.N.Y. 1978)).   I \nagree with the defendants that Lonich  controls he re, and that the “among other things” language is \nsurplusage.  See id.   The government’s theory of conspiracy can reasonably be understood even \nwhen limiting the scope of the charge to the two listed objectives in Paragraph 36.  Therefore, \ndefendants’ motion to strike the “among other things” language is GRANTED.  \nIII. MOTION TO SEVER  \nDefendants finally request that Counts Six and Seven be severed from the remainder of the \nIndictment, and that those counts be tried separately as to each defendant.  I agree with the \ngovernment that joinder of the counts does not appear prejudicial.  Howe ver, with respect to \nseverance of the defendants’ trials, I do not currently have enough information to decide whether \nseverance is warranted.  As I explain below, there are significant concerns about both prejudice \nand judicial economy that remain unresol ved.  Accordingly, I DENY defendants’ motion at this \ntime but will reconsider this issue closer to trial . \nA.  Severance of Counts Six and Seven from the Indictment is Unnecessary.  \nUnder Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a), joinder of two or more offenses is proper \nwhen the offenses charged are “of the same or similar character, or are based on the same acts or \ntransaction, or are connected with or constitute parts of a common sc heme or plan.”  Fed. R. Crim. \nP. 8(a).  Only one of these three prongs must be found for joinder to be proper.  See United States \nv. Jawara , 474 F.3d 565, 578 (9th Cir. 2007).  This liberal standard applies because joinder “is the \nrule, severance the excep tion.”  United States v. Free , 841 F.2d 321, 324 n.1 (9th Cir. 1988).  But \nthese factors are “not infinitely elastic,” and there must be a “valid basis for joinder . . . discernible \nfrom the face of the indictment.”  Jawara , 474 F.3d at 473 (citing United States v. Randazzo , 80 Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 16 of 23 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  F.3d 623, 627 (1st Cir. 1996)).  \nHere, the government invokes two of the three bases for joinder —that Counts Six and \nSeven are “of the same or similar character” as the other counts, and that all seven counts are \n“connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.”  \ni. Same or Similar Character  \nBoth parties agree that Jawara  sets forth  the standard for determining whether two claims \nare of a “same or similar character” under Rule 8(a).  See Strike Mot. at 4; Oppo. at 15 –16.  In \nJawara , the Ninth Circuit held that in determining whether two or more claims are “same or \nsimilar in character,” district courts must consider “[1] the elements of the statutory offenses, [2] \nthe temporal proximity of the acts, [3] the likelihood and extent of evidentiary overlap, [4] the \nphysical location of the acts, [5]  the modus operandi of the crimes, and [6] the identity of the \nvictims.”  474 F.3d at 577.  \nDefendants maintain that none of the facts in Jawara  support joinder.  Sever Mot. at 10.  \nFirst, they point out that the victims in Counts Six and Seven —the United States —are different \nfrom the investor victims in Counts One through Five.  Id.  Each scheme also occurred at different \ntimes.  Id.  They further allege that the use of a computer in the PPP loan scheme, but “puffery” in \nthe GoldenSpear and AI Health schemes, suggests that the modus operandi of the crimes are \ndistinct.  Id.  And because the facts  defendants allegedly used to defraud in Counts Six and \nSeven —incorrect statistics about GoldenSpear’s payroll and number of U.S. -based workers —were \nnever used in Counts One through Five, no evidentiary overlap exists between the claims.  Id. \nThe government conversely argues that enough similarities exist between the claims to \nsupport joinder.  See Oppo. at 15 –16.  For example, Count Six (bank fraud) includes many of the \nsame elements as Counts Three through Five (wire fraud), such as “a materially false statement, an \nintent to defraud and intent to deceive and cheat, and the obtaining of money or property throu gh \nthe false statements.”  Id. at 16.  Similarly, the time frames of the schemes are “relatively close” to \neach other, despite not overl apping.  Id.  The “modus operandi” of each scheme revolves around \ndefendants making “materially false statements about the nature, operations, and technology of \nGoldenSpear and AI Health.”  Id.  And much of the evidence supporting Counts Six and Seven Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 17 of 23 \n19 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  F.2d 422, 429 (2d Cir. 1978) (citation modified)).  \nWith respect to this factor, defendants contend that Counts Six and Seven “allege an \nisolated wrongdoing,” and that the “sole connection” between these counts with the rest of the \nindictment is that GoldenSpear “is the entity that the PPP loan relates to.”   Sever Mot. at 7.  \nBecause the Indictment does not allege “any connection whatsoever [between] this loan \napplication and any of the Soto’s dealings with GoldenSpear or AI Health investors,” defendants \nconclude, no nexus exists to prove a common scheme or plan.  Id. \nTo support their argument, defendants cite United States v. Halper , 590 F.2d 422 (2d Cir. \n1978).  In Halper , the Second Circuit found that the defendant’s tax evasion and Medicaid fraud \ncharges were improperly joined because their connection was “entirely too speculative to justify \njoinder.”  590 F.2d at 429.  But Halper  is readily distinguishable.   It does not procedurally address \nthe issue in this case: whether joinder is proper under Rule 8(a).  See id. ; United States v. Krug , \n198 F. Supp. 3d 235, 249 n. 5 (W.D.N.Y. 2016).  Rather, “ Halper  concerned whether two \nindictments, each charging distinct conduct, were properly joined under Rule 13.”  Krug , 198 F. \nSupp. 3d at 24 8 n.5.5   \nMoreover , the facts of Halper  are distinguishable .  In Harper , the government alleged that \nthe defendant’s Medicaid fraud “produced the income” he later used to commit tax evasion, but it \nultimately conceded that it could not prove this connection.  See 590 F.2d at 429.  Here, by \ncontrast, Counts Six and Seven charge conduct so closely connected to that in Counts One through \nFive that they can be deemed part of the same scheme —“obtaining money through false \nrepresentations about the GoldenSpear business.”   See id. ; Oppo. at 17.  \nDefendants’ reliance on United States v. Sarkisian , 197 F.3d 966 (9th Cir. 1999), is also \nmisplaced.  In Sarkisian , the Ninth Circuit found that the joinder of an extortion and auto part \ntrafficking charge was improper because there were no “meaningful connections” between the \ncharges.  197 F.3d at 9 76.  However, joinder in Sarkisian  was challenged under Federal Rule of \n \n5 While Rule 13 is “informed by Rule 8,” the two rules apply different standards that may not \nalways reflect one another.  Id.; see, e.g. , Halper , 590 F.2d at 428 (“[E]ven if the offenses could \nhave been joined in a single indictment under Rule 8(a), the trial court is not automatically free to \norder the indictments tried together under Rule 13.”).  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 19 of 23 \n20 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Criminal Procedure 8(b) —governing joinder of multiple defendants —not Rule 8(a).  Id. at 975.  \nRule 8(b) contains no similar language concerning a “common scheme or plan,” making \ndefendants’ use of this case inapposite.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b).  \nFinding the case law cited by defendants unpersuasive, I turn again to Jawara .  For joinder \nto be proper under a “common scheme or plan,” the government must show  that the counts “grow \nout of related transactions.” Id. 474 F.3d at 574.  Such connections must go “beyond mere \nthematic similarity.”  Id. \nThe government has met its burden here.  First, as described above, the Indictment \nsufficiently alleges that the GoldenSpear and AI Health schemes were “logically and factually \nentwined, as AI Health is the direct offshoot of GoldenSpear.”  Oppo. at 17; see Indict. ¶ 18.  The \nIndictment similarly explains how the PPP loan scheme “gr[e]w out of” the GoldenSpear fraud, as \ndefendants provided false information about GoldenSpear in the PPP application and received \nimproper funding in GoldenSpear’s bank account.   Jawara , 474 F.3d at 574; see Indict. ¶¶ 29 –30.  \nFinally, the Indictment indicates that the AI Health and PPP loan schemes “gr[e]w out of related \ntransactions” because they reflect a shift by defendants to take advantage of the COVID -19 \npandemic to continue their original GoldenSpear conspiracy.  Jawara , 474 F.3d at 574; see Indict. \n¶¶ 18, 27.   \nThis evidence suggests more than a “mere thematic similarity” —it shows a detailed \nconspiracy connecting the three schemes together.  Jawara , 474 F.3d at 574.  Accordingly, a \n“common scheme or plan” can be inferred from the Indictment.  The claims were properly joined \nunder Rule 8(a).  \nB. It is Unclear Whether Severance Under Rule 14(a) is Warranted.  \nThe parties finally dispute whether severance of the defendants’ cases for Counts Six and \nSeven is required under Rule 14(a).  Sever Mot. at 11; see Reese , 2 F.3d at 892.  Defendants argue \nthat severance is necessary because “one of the defendants ( “Santos” ) is prepared to offer \nsubstantially exculpatory testimony on behalf of defendant Saints at a separate trial on Counts 6 -\n7.”  Sever Mot. at 11.  Without severance, they conclude, a joint trial on Counts Six and Seven \nwould be unfairly prejudicial.  See id . Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 20 of 23 \n21 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  To support their argument, defendants rely on United States v. Reese .  Id. at 2; 2 F.3d 870  \n(9th Cir. 1993).  In Reese , the Ninth Circuit affirmed that “[w]hen the reason for severance is the \nneed for a codefendant’s testimony,” the defendant must show “(1) that he would call the \n[co]defendant at a severed trial , (2) that the codefendant would in fact testify , and (3) that the \ntestimony would be favorable to the moving party.”  Id. at 892 (citing United States v. Hernandez , \n952 F.2d 1110, 1115 (9th Cir. 199 2), cert. denied , 506 U.S. 920 (1992)).  \nApplying Reese , defendants conclude that all three factors are met.  First, counsel for \ndefendants submitted a declaration confirming that she would, in fact, call Santos Soto as a \nwitness in Saints Soto’s trial, should they be severed.  See Declaration of Elizabeth Falk in \nSupport of Motion to Sever (“Falk Decl.”) [Dkt. No. 77] at 1.  Additionally , Santos Soto submitted \nhis own declaration which defendants claim contains evidence of “significant, substantial  and \nimportant exculpatory information” that should be heard at  Saints Soto’s severed trial.  See Sever \nMot. at 12 ; Declaration of Santos Rene Soto in Support of Motion to Sever (“Santos Soto Decl.”) \n[Dkt. No. 78 -1].6 \nIn response, the government calls defendants’ efforts to sever a prejudicial, “antagonistic \ndefense strategy.”  Oppo. at 17.  It claims that “Saints Soto plans to blame Santos Soto for the \ncrime, and Santos Soto wants to preserve his ability, at a separate trial, to argue that Saints Soto \nsubmitted the false application.”  Id.  This alone is insufficient to warrant severance, the \ngovernment argues —if it were, severance would be allowed whenever a defendant “raises the \npossibility that a co -defendant would t estify in a manner helpful to that defendant.”  Id. \nThe government maintains that join der of defendants’ trials may not be prejudicial under \nRule 14.  Rather than sever the cases, the government argues that “careful and frequent limiting \ninstructions to the jury, explaining how and against whom certain evidence may be considered,” \ncan reduce o r eliminate any possibility of prejudice from a joint trial.  Id. at 18; United States v. \nFernandez , 388 F.3d 1199, 124 3 (9th Cir. 2004), amended on other grounds , 425 F.3d 1248 (9th \nCir. 2005).  As an example, it point s to the Ninth Circuit model jury instructions.  See Oppo. at 18;  \n \n6 This information is currently filed ex parte and under seal; the government has not reviewed the \ndeclaration.  See Oppo. at 19.  Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 21 of 23 \n22 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Ninth Circuit Model Criminal Jury Instruction No. 6.11 (“A separate crime is charged against the \ndefendant in each count.  You must decide each count separately.  Your verdict on one count \nshould not control your verdict on any other count.”).  \nAfter reviewing Santos Soto’s declaration, I agree with defendants that the Reese  factors \nare met.  But this is not the end of my inquiry.  I must also consider the questions of judicial \neconomy and prejudice, which currently pull in opposite directions.  With respect to prejudice, it \nappears that the testimony Santos Soto seeks to present in a separate trial may be exculpatory; as a \nresult, it would be p rejudicial to exclude such testimony, should a joint trial occur.  This certainly \nweighs strongly in fav or of severance.  \nWhere I have difficulty is  how to evaluate  the question of judicial economy , which also \nimplicates prejudice to the government .  Defendants claim that the “costs of severed trials on the \nPPP allegations will be fairly modest as the factual and legal issues . . . are straightforward and \ndiscrete.”  Sever Mot. at 12.  They also argue  that the “documentary evidence regarding this single \nloan is not voluminous,” and that a separate trial on these issues “should only last a few days, at \nmost.”  Id. at 12 –13.  Finally, they cite to authority suggesting that judicial economy “cannot \nbecome a talisman in the severance analysis,” as “judicial economy will always weigh against a \nseverance because one trial is always more economical than two.”  Id. at 6 (citing United States v. \nMcCord , No. CR 16 -00984 -TUC -RM(EJM), 2016 WL 8669900, at * 8 (D. Ariz. Sept. 23, 2016)).  \nI need to better understand the evidence that will be presented at trial on this claim and the \neffect on the trial plan if I grant severance.  It would seem that at least three trials would be \nrequired  in that  event —one jointly trying Counts One through Five, one for Saints Soto on Counts \nSix and Seven, and one for Santos Soto on Counts Six and Seven.  Would the trials on Counts Six \nand Seven precede the trial on Counts One through Five?  How would the verdicts on Counts Six \nand Seven impact the trial on the other counts?  Or vice versa?  Is defendants’  current  \ncharacterization of the severed trials accurate?   Is there a risk of inconsistent verdicts if three trials \noccur?  \nThese questions were not discussed in the motion or at the hearing.  At this point, \ndiscovery has not concluded, and more  factual and legal questions may arise with respect to the Case 3:22-cr-00378-WHO     Document 93     Filed 10/30/25     Page 22 of 23 \n23 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  PPP loan applications.  What may seem to be a “straightforward and discrete” issue now may not \nbe in light of all the evidence .  See Sever Mot. at 12.  These are serious concerns, and I do not \nthink they are merely  a “talisman in the severance analysis.”  See Sever Mot. at 6.  \nBecause of these issues , I will not  resolve the Rule 14(a) issue until a more developed  \nrecord is available to weigh the prejudicial effects of joinder  versus the prejudicial effects and \ncomplications the severed trials would bring.  Defendants should raise this issue again when the \ntrial(s) schedule is discussed after discovery is complete.   \nCONCLUSION  \n Defendants’ motions to dismiss, sever, and strike the non -disclosure theory of fraud are \nDENIED .  Their motion to strike the “among other things” language in Count Two  is GRANTED.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  October 30, 2025  \n \n  \nWilliam H.

    "summary": "### 1. Summary\n\nThis court opinion pertains to a case where the plaintiffs allege that their due process rights were violated through the creation and implementation of the Michigan Integrated Data Automated System (MiDAS), an automated system used for unemployment claims processing. The opinion focuses on whether testimony from expert and non-retained witnesses regarding MiDAS should be admissible, evaluating procedural and substantive compliance with rules governing expert disclosures. The court ruled to exclude several testimonies that failed to comply with legal standards and allowed only factual testimony about the MiDAS system from certain witnesses.\n\n### 2. Key Legal Issue\n\nThe key legal issue in this case is whether the expert and non-retained expert disclosures by the defendants meet the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically concerning the admissibility of opinions related to MiDAS’s role in the alleged due process violations.\n\n### 3. Court's Holding\n\nThe court held that the majority of the testimony from non-retained experts could not be considered expert opinion testimony due to lack of compliance with procedural rules for expert disclosures. However, testimony related to factual descriptions of how MiDAS functioned and interacted with claims processing was deemed admissible. Specific expert opinions that amounted to legal conclusions were excluded, and CSG’s retained expert's testimony was limited.\n\n### 4. ELI5 Explanation\n\nImagine you're in a town where the local government uses a complicated machine to decide if people deserve tax refunds, but some residents believe this machine wrongfully labeled them as fraudsters, blocking their refunds. In a trial, the judge must decide who can explain how the machine works and whether it’s to blame. The judge says only the people who directly worked with this machine can describe what happened but can't give their opinions on whether it was fair unless they strictly follow the rules on who can share expert opinions.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN \nSOUTHERN DIVISION \n PATTI JO CAHOO, KRISTEN MENDYK, KHADIJA COLE, HYON PAK, and MICHELLE DAVISON,     Plaintiffs,    Case Number 17-10657 v.        Honorable David M. Lawson  FAST ENTERPRISES LLC, CSG GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS, STEPHEN GESKEY,  SHEMIN BLUNDELL, DORIS MITCHELL, DEBRA SINGLETON, and SHARON  MOFFET-MASSEY,     Defendants. __________________________________________/   \nOPINION AND ORDER GRANTING IN PART AND DENYING IN PART \nMOTIONS TO STRIKE EXPE RT WITNESS DISCLOSURES \nAND BAR EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY  \n \n The plaintiffs have filed two batches of mo tions challenging the admissibility of testimony \nfrom witnesses identified by the de fendants as experts.  One set of motions attacks the testimony \non procedural grounds under Federal Rules of Civ il Procedure 26(a)(2) and 37(c)(1).  The other \nset of motions question the substa nce of the testimony as  not measuring up to the strictures of \nEvidence Rule 702.  The defendants in turn have m oved to exclude the testimony of the plaintiffs’ \nrebuttal expert witness.  For reas ons explained below, the reports of  some of the defense witnesses \nare inadequate and those witnesses will not be pe rmitted to give opinion testimony.  One of the \nwitnesses intends to give expert  testimony amounting to legal opini ons, which is not permissible.  \nThe plaintiffs have not furnishe d a proper report for th eir putative rebuttal witness, but that is \nlargely inconsequential because th ere will be no allowable opinion testimony for him to rebut.  The Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 1 of 24-2- \n remaining witnesses targeted by the motions furnis hed reports describing in tended testimony that \nwill be admissible.  The motions will be granted in part and denied in part.   \nI. \n The identified witnesses all intend to give testimony on one or more aspects of the one \nremaining claim, which is that the plaintiffs’ right to due process of law was abridged by the \ncreation and implementation of the Michigan Integrated Data Automated System (MiDAS).  Many of the witnesses designated by the defendants are not  specially retained to give testimony in the \ncase.  They are employees of the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) or the \nrespective corporate defendants, w ho will describe the activities of their employers and explain \nwhat they found when they examin ed the plaintiffs’ claim files.   The various defendants have \nfurnished differing levels of detail  in their reports under Rule 26(a)(2)(C), whic h requires that the \nparty (not the witness) disclose “the subject ma tter,” the facts,” and “t he opinions” to which the \nwitness is expected to testify.   \nA. \n All the defendants named four UIA employees  who examined the claim files for one or \nmore of the plain tiffs: Mandy Brickel (a  UIA claims examiner who re viewed plaintiff Hyon Pak’s \nclaim file); Jessica Hart (plain tiff Michelle Davison’s claim file); Katherine Potter (plaintiff \nKristen Mendyk’s claim file); a nd Kevin Smith (plaintif fs Patti Jo Cahoo’s and Khadija Cole’s \nclaim files).  Defendant CSG’s disclosure for witness Mandy Br ickel mimics the disclosures for \nthe other file examiner s.  It described the subject matt er of her testimony as follows: \nMs. Brickel will testify regarding the inte rpretation of UIA’s claimant file for \nMr. Hyon Pak and UIA’s processing, revi ew, investigation, determinations, \nactions, communications, involvement, or  collection effort s relating to any \nunemployment claims or communications, submittals, proceedings, appeals, or \nadjudications related thereto in any wa y involving or relating to Mr. Hyon Pak. Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 2 of 24-3- \n CSG combined the description of Brickel’s facts and opinions:  \nMs. Brickel will testify that Mr. Pak’s re levant claim was adjudicated in October \n2012, before UIA even began using MiDAS. Ms.  Brickel will furt her testify that \nhuman claims examiners — rather than automated business rules — used their \nindependent judgment to adjudicate Mr. Pak as committing fraud. She will \nfurther testify that Mr. Pak chose to  Go Green, frequently logged into his \nMiWAM account, and that Mr. Pak could not have avoided seeing the numerous \nnotices UIA sent to him. Ms. Brickel also  will testify that the UIA had exclusive \nauthority to set the policies and proce dures of the UIA th at were programmed \ninto the MiDAS system and that UIA neve r delegated that authority to CSG.  \nCSG declared that Brickel “may also render addi tional opinions identified in documents,” but did \nnot specify what they will be.    FAST Enterprises similarly disclosed the expected testimony of the file examiners \nemployed by the UIA.  Again, the disc losure for Mandy Brickel was typical: \nBrickel will testify that, based on her revi ew of the UIA claim file for Pak, it is \nclear that Pak committed fraud in obtaining the payments from UIA at issue in this case.  Brickel will testify regarding what is indicated in UIA’s file for Pak \nrelating to his unemployment claims, a nd what information regarding Pak’s \nclaims were initiated in the legacy system  that predated MiDAS.  She is expected \nto testify that factfinding regarding Pa k’s fraud claim began before MiDAS was \nin place.  Brickel will testify that UI A personnel were involved in adjudicating \nthe fraud claims against Pak, and that MiDAS did not auto-a djudicate the fraud  \ndeterminations against Pak that is at i ssue here. She will testify that Pak chose \nthe “Go Green” option and received correspondence from UIA electronically, \nthrough the MiWAM portal.  Sh e will testify that Pak’s cl aim file indicates that \nnotices were properly and timely placed  in Pak’s MiWAM account.  She will \ntestify that Pak logged onto his Mi WAM account, including logging on multiple \ntimes shortly after his fra ud determinations were adj udicated and notices thereof \ndelivered to him.  She will testify th at Pak received notices relating to \nwithholding of taxes and garnishment of wa ges.  She will testify that Pak’s fraud \ndeterminations were affirmed as part of the Zynda review.  She will testify \nregarding the email and physic al addresses that were in  UIA’s file that were \nprovided by Pak.  Brickel will testify regarding her review of Gott’s claim file and her conclusion that Gott’s fraud de termination was not auto-adjudicated. \nBrickel will also testify that MiDAS is not a form of artificial intelligence, but rather just automates certain UIA rules and procedures.  Bric kel may also render \nadditional opinions identified in docu ments — including the interpretation of \nPak’s and Gott’s UIA claim files in general — and testimony disclosed to \nPlaintiffs in the instant case. Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 3 of 24-4- \n  Finally, the state defendants also  served disclosures for the file  examiners, but those reports \nwere considerably more cursory.  The di sclosure for Mandy Brickell was typical: \nMandy Brickell Subject matter: Inform ation related to the policies and \nprocedures regarding claims adjudi cation and Plaintiffs’ claims for \nunemployment benefits. Facts: Please refer to Ms. Brickell’s deposition testimony. Ms. Brickell will testify as to  the facts and contents regarding Hyon \nPak’s Unemployment Insurance Agency cl aims file, including  the procedures \nfollowed regarding same. \nIt is not clear, however, that the state defenda nts intend to elicit opinion testimony from the file \nexaminers.  They explain that they more likely will be called as fact witnesses, and that they \nfurnished reports under Rule 26(a)(2)(C) “out of an abundance of caution” should the witnesses \nhappen to provide opinion testimony.    The plaintiffs argue that these disclosure s do not satisfy Rule 26(a)(2)’s requirements \nbecause they do not identify any opinions that thes e witnesses will offer.  Instead, the plaintiffs \nfear that the file examiners will be identified as experts but offer only fact testimony.   \n A party seeking to rely on non-retained expe rt testimony must provide  an expert witness \ndisclosure that summarizes (1) “the subject matter on which the witness is expected to present \nevidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or  705,” (2) “the facts” “to which the witness \nis expected to testify,” and (3) “the opinions to which the witness is expected to testify.” Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 26(a)(2)(C).  The disclosure  need not be signed by the witness; counsel’s signature will do.  \nAnd the disclosures for non-retained experts under Rule 26(a)(2)(C) are “considerably less \nextensive than the report required by Rule 26(a) (2)(B).”  Fed R. Civ. P. 26, Advisory Committee \nNotes on 2010 Am. to Rule 26(a)(2)(C).  Courts are cautioned “against requiring undue detail, \nkeeping in mind that these witnesse s have not been specially retain ed and may not be as responsive \nto counsel as those who have.”  Ibid.  But counsel still must touch all the bases listed in Rule Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 4 of 24-5- \n 26(a)(2)(C) to fulfill the purpose of the disclosure requirement, wh ich is to prevent “surprise[s] as \nto the scope of testimony.” Fielden v. CSX Transp., Inc ., 482 F.3d 866, 871 (6th Cir. 2007).   \n One of the requirements, a summary of the witness’s opinions, “mea ns a brief account of \nthe main opinions of the expert”; “the opinions must state a view or j udgment regarding a matter \nthat affects the outcome of the case.   A mere statement of the topics of the opini ons is insufficient.”  \nLittle Hocking Water Ass’n, Inc. v.  E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co. , No. 09-1081, 2015 WL \n1105840, at *9 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 11, 2015).  Likewi se, a summary of the facts “means a brief \naccount of facts — only those on which the expert ac tually relied in for ming his or her opinions \n— that states the main points derived from a larg er body of information; me rely stating the topic \nmatters of facts relied  upon does not suffice.”  Ibid. \n Where an expert disclosure is itself not detailed, the opini ons and supporting facts of non-\nretained experts may be disclosed in other discovery responses .  See Owens-Hart v. Howard Univ. , \n317 F.R.D. 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2016) (123 pages of medical records produced in discovery helped satisfy \nRule 26(a)(2)(C)’s disclosure requirements rega rding treating physician’s facts and opinions).  \nHowever, the reference to other documents, or th e suggestion that the opponent read the witness’s \ndeposition, will not suffice.   \n Measured against this sta ndard, CSG’s disclosures pertai ning to the file examiners \nadequately describe the subject ma tter of the file examin ers’ testimony, and they  give some insight \ninto some opinions that they may offer.  Those opi nions appear to be that, based on the file reviews, \nhuman claims examiners — and not an au to-adjudication process — made the fraud \ndeterminations.  And those opini ons and their bases are describe d adequately e nough to satisfy \nRule 26(a)(2)(C).  But other opinions — that th e claimants could not have avoided seeing the \nemailed notices, and that the UIA never delegated the authority to  set policy to CSG — have no Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 5 of 24-6- \n factual underpinning, and the disclosures are not adequate.  CSG may elicit fact testimony from \nthese witnesses, but it may not elicit opinions beyond those that were described as derived from \nan examination of the re spective claim files.   \n FAST’s disclosures about the file examiners mainly recite fact testimony based on what \nthe examiners found when inspecting the respective claimants’ files.   The only opinion that can be \nderived from the disclosure is testimony that MiDAS is not a form  of artificial intelligence, but \nonly an automated application of the UIA’s rules and procedures.  But there is nothing that ties \nthat opinion to any of the facts recited in the disclosure, and ther e is no indication for the basis of \nthat opinion, or even th at the respective file exam iners are qualifie d to reach that conclusion.  FAST \nmay not elicit such an opini on from these witnesses.   \n The State defendants’ disclosures contain no opin ions at all.  They will be allowed to call \nthese witnesses to testify to what they found when  examining the claim file s, but they will not be \npermitted to offer opinion testimony within the meaning of Evidence Rule 702.    \nB. \n The other non-retained experts CSG named are Clayton Tierney, a UIA employee, and \nJohn Walsworth CSG’s chief executive  officer.  It disclosed that Tierney was expected to testify \n“about the roles and responsibilitie s of CSG as a project manager,  the implementation of MiDAS, \nhow that system functioned in the claims adjudication process,  and the review process under \nZynda .  The disclosure contains a “Facts and Opini ons” section that recites a fulsome list of the \ninformation Tierney is expected to impart, such as that “at no time did CSG ever establish the \npolicies or procedures of the UIA that were pr ogrammed into the MiDAS system”; and “that CSG \nnever had any responsibility at al l in determining the al gorithms or decision  trees that the UIA \nintended the MiDAS software to use in connection with potential claimant fraud.”  None of that Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 6 of 24-7- \n expected testimony, nor  the similar statements as cribed to Tierney, amount to opinions within the \nmeaning of Evidence Rule 702.  There is one statem ent, however, that may amount to an opinion: \nthat the responsibility to adjudicate or otherwis e deal with claims “was the exclusive statutory \nprovince of the UIA.”  That opi nion amounts to a legal conclusi on, which is not a proper subject \nfor expert testimony.  See Berry v. City of Detroit , 25 F.3d 1342, 1354 (6th Cir. 1994) (holding \nthat the Sixth Circuit “is in accord  with other circuits in requiri ng exclusion of expert testimony \nthat expresses a legal conclusion”) (citing Hygh v. Jacobs , 961 F.2d 359 (2d Cir. 1992)).  Beyond \nthat, the disclosure reveals no purported opinion te stimony.  As with the file examiners, Tierney \nmay testify as a fact witness only.    CSG stated that Walsworth “will testify re garding the function of a project management \noffice and its roles and responsibilities.”  Much  like the description of  Tierney’s anticipated \ntestimony, the disclosure identifies information that amounts to fact testimony.  One statement \nborders on opinion — that “a proj ect management office like CSG’ s project management office \nfor the UIA software implementation has no power to set government agency policy, establish any \nparticular algorithms in the soft ware that others are implementi ng, configure the software in any \nway, program the software in any way, or operate the software at any time (including after it goes \nlive)” — and likely requires some special knowl edge as a foundation.  In other motions, the \nplaintiffs do not challe nge Walsworth’s qualifications to give  such an opinion, a nd the disclosure \nsatisfies Rule 26(a)(2)(C)’s requirements.    FAST identified Tierney as a non-retained expe rt as well.  Its disclosure mirrored CSG’s, \nand most of Tierney’s expected  testimony will not encompass opi nion evidence.  However, one \ndisclosure, that in light of “the diffe rent rules and criteria employed in the Zynda  [settlement] \nprocess, Tierney will testify that it is incorrect to conclude that the process resulted in a reversal Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 7 of 24-8- \n rate of more than 90%; different rules and criteria were applied, so to refer to ‘reversal rate’ is \nmisleading and incorrect,” am ounts to an opinion that was disclosed adequately.   \n FAST also disclosed non-retain ed experts Jennifer T uvell and Jon Eads.  Tuvell is expected \nto “testify about the software produced and servi ces provided by FAST, as well as FAST’s role in \ncoding MiDAS for the UIA.”  The description of the substance of her testimony focuses on how \nMiDAS worked, which appears to be factual de scriptions with no opinions.  However, the \ninformation she intends to offe r no doubt requires special knowledge , and expert testimony is not \nlimited to opinions alone.  See Fed. R Evid. 702 (stating that a quali fied expert “may testify in the \nform of an opinion or otherwise ”) (emphasis added).  FAST acknow ledged in its disclosure that \n“Tuvell’s testimony will be primarily factual but may have some elements of expert testimony.”  \nAs so limited, the disclosure is adequate to prevent “surprise[s]  as to the scope of testimony.” \nFielden , 482 F.3d at 871.    \n FAST disclosed that the expected testimony of Jon Eads, another FAST employee, will be \n“about the software produced and services provid ed by FAST.”  It says that Eads “will explain \nhow users input data into MiDAS , how the system functions base d on the UIA’s ‘logic trees,’ and \nwhen, how, and where communications were sent to claimants or employe rs.”  Like Tuvell, \n“Eads’[s] testimony will pr imarily be factual but may have some  elements of expert testimony.”  \nAnd the description of that test imony follows along the same lines, with the same result here.  The \ndisclosure is adequate.     The state defendants identified Tierney a nd also Debra Patterson, another UIA employee \ndisclosing that they “will testify about the imple mentation and functionality of MiDAS.”   They \nidentified other UIA employees as well: Kristrina Kratz (a “UIA claims ex aminer who will testify \nabout the policies and procedures regarding cl aims adjudication and plaintiffs’ claims for Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 8 of 24-9- \n unemployment benefits”), Susan Easton (a “UIA employee who will testify about the policies and \nprocedures regarding claims adju dication and plaintiffs’ claims for unemployment benefits”), and \nTeresa Burns (another “UIA employee who will test ify about the federal requirements for claims \nadjudication, the state procedures enacted to meet  federal requirements, a nd audit and investigation \nresults”).  The disclosures as to those witne sses fail to do anything bu t vaguely identify the \noverarching subject matter of the expert testimony — they neither provide a summary of the facts \nnor the opinions sought to be elicited.  Not only did the defendants fail to provide “a brief account of facts . . . that states the ma in points derived from a larger body of inform ation” upon which they \nrelied, but some, like Tierney’s and Patterson’s, did not even “sta t[e] the topic matters of facts \nrelied upon” — they merely poi nted to the depositions of their respective witnesses.  Little Hocking \nWater , 2015 WL 1105840, at *9.  The testimony of these witnesses will be limited to their fact-\nbased statements.   \nIII. \n In separate motions, the plaintiffs also move to exclude the expert testimony of each of the \nproposed non-retained experts discussed above, and also challenge CSG’s retained expert, J. Todd \nTrivett.  Trivett is expected to testify about  CSG’s role in developing and managing MiDAS and \nthe functions, roles, and responsibilities of projec t management offices.  According to his report, \nTrivett holds an MBA from Duke University a nd serves as a professional consultant with \nDisputeSoft, an independent IT consulting firm in Maryland specializing in computer forensics \nand litigation support.  Over the past 14 years, he regularly serv ed as an expert witness for \nintellectual property, contract , business torts, and insura nce coverage issues.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 9 of 24-10- \n  Trivett’s report primarily focuses on the va rious forms of projec t management offices \n(supportive, controlling, and directive) as describe d by the Project Management Institute; it also \ndetails CSG’s involvement with MiDAS as a suppor tive project manager.   His opinion — that  \n“at no time did CSG have the responsibility or  authority to have committed the ‘wrongful \npractices’ alleged by the plaintiffs ” — is based on his “review and analysis  . . . of contract \ndocuments, testimony, and exhibits presented at the deposition of the State’s Project Manager, \nClayton Tierney.”  Trivett writes in his report: \nWith respect to system functionality, CSG’ s role was limited to the elicitation and \ndocumentation of the business rules, process flows, and decision trees dictated by \nthe State’s representatives.  In the li mited instances where CSG was asked to \nanalyze and investigate “best practices” and provide recommendations, the State \nhad the ultimate responsibility  and authority to heed - or choose not to heed - CSG’s \nrecommendations.  Furthermore, at no time did CSG recommend that the State \nadopt the “auto-adjudication”  procedures at the heart of the Plaintiffs’ Amended \nComplaint.  \n The plaintiffs argue that the defendants’ non-retained expert w itnesses should not be \nallowed to testify as experts because (1) the pr oposed testimony from those witnesses are improper \nsubjects of expert treatment be cause they concern factual matter s about which knowledgeable fact \nwitnesses may testify; and (2) the witnesses are unqualified to provide expert testimony.  The \nplaintiffs also argue that Todd Tr ivet should not be ab le to testify because  his testimony (1) is \nirrelevant; (2) mirrors the fact testimony of UIA employee Clayton Tier ney, and (3) contains \nimpermissible legal conclusions (CSG  lacked the responsibility or authority to have committed the \n“wrongful practices” allege d by the plaintiffs).   \nA. \n According to the disclosures discussed above, with few exceptions, the non-retained expert \nwitnesses are not expected to gi ve any opinion testimony that falls within th e ambit of Evidence Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 10 of 24-11- \n Rule 702.  Their testimony may touch on areas re quiring special knowledge, such as describing \nthe functionality of MiDAS and the claims proces sing protocols.  That special knowledge appears \nto be based on their experience, and by that measure the plaintiffs’ challenge to their qualifications \nfalls short.    “Rule 702 expressly contemplates that an expert may be qualified on the basis of \nexperience.”  Fed. R. Evid. 702, advisory commi ttee’s note, 2000 amend. The Sixth Circuit has \nexplained that the traditional Daubert  factors “cannot readily  be applied to meas ure the re liability \nof such testimony.”  Surles ex rel. Johnson v. Greyhound Lines, Inc ., 474 F.3d 288, 296 (6th Cir. \n2007).  Rather, experiential expert  testimony is appropriate wher e the expert “explain[s] how \nth[eir] experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the \nopinion, and how that ex perience is reliably ap plied to the facts.” Ibid. (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702, \nadvisory committee’s note, 2000 amend.) .  “In certain fields , experience is the predominant, if not \nsole, basis for a great deal of reliable expert testimony.” Fed. R.  Evid. 702, adviso ry committee’s \nnote, 2000 amend.; see, e.g., Wood v. Wal-Mart Stores E., LP , 576 F. App’x. 470, 472 (6th Cir. \n2014) (holding that there was “ample  reason” to conclude  that a non-scientific  expert’s testimony \nwas reliable and would assist the jury where wi tness had professional experience dealing with \nbuilding codes as a commercial architect); Surles ex rel. Johnson , 474 F.3d at 296 (holding that \ndistrict court properly admitted testimony from expert regardi ng experience designing driver’s \nenclosures for tr ansit buses).   \n Insofar as these witnesses will describe how  MiDAS worked, and how it was used (or not) \nin the fraud adjudications of these plaintiffs, th eir testimony fits within the permissible bounds of \nRule 702.  United States v. Garner  provides a helpful guide.  In th at case, the Sixth Circuit found \nthat the particular forensic software used by an IRS special agent to determine whether the Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 11 of 24-12- \n defendant altered or destroyed documents exceeded the knowledge  of laypersons and upheld the \ndistrict court’s decision that the testimony could be offered under Rule 702.  468 F.3d 920, 923, \n926 (6th  Cir. 2006).  The Court conclude d that “[t]he average laypers on today may be able to \ninterpret the outputs of p opular software programs [like Micros oft Word and Outl ook] as easily as \nhe or she interprets everyday vernac ular, but the interpretation [the expert witness] needed to apply \nto make sense of the software reports is more similar  to the specialized knowledge police officers \nuse to interpret slang and code words used by drug dealers.”  Id. at 926 (citing United States v. \nGarcia , 72 F.3d 130 (6th Cir. Dec. 4, 1995) (unpublished) (affirming a decision to allow a police \nofficer to give expert te stimony as to the me aning of certain code words)).  \n MiDAS is a complicated software-based syst em, the explanation of which requires special \nknowledge beyond that of a layperson, as demonstr ated by the hundreds — if  not thousands — of \npages of deposition testimony on the matter.   Here, the UIA file examiners have been disclosed \nas expert witnesses to testify about how each of th e plaintiff’s claims was adjudicated and the role \nMiDAS played in the process.  No opinions of  these witnesses were disclosed, but they are \nqualified by experience to describe the UIA’s pro cessing, review, investiga tions, and adjudications \nof the five named plain tiffs in the case.  This  testimony may well “help the trier of fact to \nunderstand the evidence or to determine a fact in  issue.”  Fed. R. Evid. 702.   Although most of \nthe expected testimony amounts to factual descri ptions, the subject matte r that the defendants’ \nwitnesses will relate is relevant  to the plaintiffs’ allegations and are necessary topics that the \ndefendants must present to defend themselves.  The witnesses are presented as individuals with \nspecial knowledge, based on their experience with  the Agency’s claim adjudication process and \nMiDAS.  Although most of the test imony is factual, these witnesse s may need to rely on their \nspecial knowledge to devel op those facts, and to that extent it  will exceed the knowledge base of Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 12 of 24-13- \n the average juror and enter the realm of Rule 702.  Because the witnesses’ experience qualifies \nthem to give that evidence, Rule 702 erects no barrier to such testimony.  See Garcia , 72 F.3d 130.  \n Similarly, the other UIA employees Clayton Tierney and Debra Patterson will testify about \nthe implementation of MiDAS, how th at system functioned in the cl aims adjudication process, and \nthe review process under Zynda .  Susan Easton will testify about the policies and procedures \nregarding claims adjudication in general and the plaintiffs’ cla ims for unemployment benefits.  \nTeresa Burns will testify about the federal re quirements for claims adjudication, the state \nprocedures enacted to meet federa l requirements, and audit and inve stigation results.  And Kristina \nKratz may help define what some of the jargon in the claim files mean.  See, e.g., Kratz Dep., ECF \nNo. 399-28, PageID.17628 (explaining the stages of Mi DAS adjudication, clarifying how to read \nclaim files, and defining jargon, like “batch,” wh ich indicates that MiDAS changed the st atus of a \nfraud case automatically).    FAST’s and CSG’s employees identified as n on-retained experts similarly will testify \nabout the operational and management functions of their respective employers  as they interacted \nwith the State in the rollout of MiDAS.  As with the file examiner s, these witnesses will not offer \nopinions, but they may use their sp ecial knowledge to elucidate their explanations.  That sort of \ntestimony traditionally has been allowed, ev en when it does not include “opinions.”  See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Johnson , 488 F.3d 690, 698 (6th Cir. 2007) (“Th ere are innumerable trades and \npractices that employ their uni que devices, feints, and codes that may mean nothing to the \nuntrained observer but may speak volumes to a maven qualified by experience or training.”).   \n This testimony is allowable.     Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 13 of 24-14- \n B. \n As a retained expert, J. Todd Trivett stands on a slightly different f ooting.  He does intend \nto give opinion testimony, which fa lls fully within the scope of Ev idence Rule 702.  Therefore, his \ntestimony must be grounded in  the actual facts of the case, must be valid according to the discipline \nthat furnished the base of special knowledge, and mu st appropriately “fit” the facts of the case into \nthe theories and methods he espou ses.  Fed. R. Evid. 702(a)-(d); Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., \nInc., 509 U.S. 579, 591-93(1993).   \n The plaintiffs contend that Trivett’s testimony a bout the role of pr oject managers and \nCSG’s compliance with the State’s contract is irrelevant because it has nothing to do with “the \nconstitutional requirements at issue” in this case.  However, Trivett does not intend to opine on \nwhether CSG performed its contractual obligations  adequately or met industry standards; his \ntestimony addresses CSG’s role under  the contract and the services it provided to the State.   \n The testimony is relevant to the issue of causation and whether CSG can be considered a \nstate actor.  Both issues are front and center in  the parties’ pending cross-motions for summary \njudgment.  See Martin v. Warren Cnty., Kentucky , 799 F. App’x 329, 337 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing \nPowers v. Hamilton Cnty. Pub. Defender Comm’n , 501 F.3d 592, 608 (6th Ci r. 2007) (plaintiffs \nmust show that defendants’ condu ct was both a cause in fact and a proximate cause of the alleged \ndue process violation); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co ., 457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982) (for liability to \nattach under section 1983, “the party charged with th e deprivation must be a person who may fairly \nbe said to be a state actor.”).  Trivett’s report addresses those issues and will aid the factfinder in understanding what CSG did in its role as a proj ect manager; i.e., the extent of its technical \noversight, administration of the system, and de velopment of the polic ies and logic trees.  See \nTrivett Report, ECF No. 380-1, PageID.16677-83, ¶¶ 17-25.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 14 of 24-15- \n  The plaintiffs argue that th e Court should exclude portions of Trivett’s testimony that \nmerely mirror Tierney’s anticipa ted testimony, referencing parts of Trivett’s report where he \nquotes Tierney’s deposition testimony to support his position.  Trivett Report, ECF No. 380-1, \nPageID.16683-85, ¶¶ 26, 29 (quoting seven ques tions and seven answers).  Relying on United \nStates v. Whyte , the plaintiffs contend that “a district court may commit manifest error by admitting \nexpert testimony where the eviden ce impermissibly mirrors the test imony offered by fact witnesses \n. . . .”  795 F. A’ppx 353, 360 (6th Cir. 2019) (quotation marks omitted).   Whyte  does not support that argument.  In that  case, the court of appeals approved the \ndistrict court’s admission  of a police officer’s te stimony about the meaning of street language and \nrejected the argument th at the testimony impermissibly mirrore d that of fact witnesses.  Ibid.  The \ncourt emphasized that it generally  will “affirm the admiss ion of expert testim ony . . . so long as \nthe district court does not al low the expert law enforcement witness either to relay the \ngovernment’s theory of the case to the jury under th e guise of jargon interpre tation or to interpret \nplain English statemen ts that a reasonable juror could understand on their own.”  Ibid.  \n Here, it appears that Trivett will use Tierney’s testimony to substantiate his opinion based on his interpretation of the contract and knowle dge of project management standards.  For \nexample, in paragraph 25 of his report, Trivett op ines that CSG’s contract language did not grant \nCSG the authority to “determin[e] the State’s business requirements for MiDAS,” “the functionality of and workflows re lated to MiDAS,” nor the policie s “that drove those requirements \nand workflows.”  Trivett Report, ECF No. 380- 1, PageID.16683, ¶ 25.  In the following paragraph, \nTrivett cites Tierney’s deposition testimony, which affirmed that the “UIA was responsible to use \nits own independent judgment in making the decisi ons relating to which business rules, processes, \nand functionality was going to be required in  the system modernization project.”   Id. at Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 15 of 24-16- \n PageID.16684, ¶ 26.  That reference ve rified Trivett’s reliance on the underlying facts.  It did not \nparrot them.    Trivett also opined, based on CSG’s contract  language, that CSG’ s “Technical Writing” \nservices in developing the request for propos al (RFP) focused on “co mmunicating the State’s \nrequirements which reflect the Stat e’s policies,” not “creating thos e requirements or policies.”  Id. \n¶ 29.  For support, he cited Tierney’s testimony that  “the [S]tate relied on [the UIA] to further \nbusiness aspects of [the RFP], [i ncluding the] business rules or requirements” and that the UIA \nvetted all of the RFP documents.  Id. at PageID.16684-85, ¶ 29.  Trivett’s reliance on Tierney’s \ndeposition testimony to supplement his opinion s based on CSG’s contract language does not \n“impermissibly mirror[] the testimony offered by fact witnesses.”  Whyte , 795 F. A’ppx at 360.   \n The plaintiffs also argue that in the passages that cite Tierney’s testimony, “Trivett offers \nno opinion based on scientific, technical, or specializ ed knowledge.  Instead, he simply states that \nhe agrees with” Tierney’s testimony.  That is not entirely accurate.   In addition to interpreting \nCSG’s contract and referencing Tierney’s tes timony, Trivett relied on the project management \nindustry standards provided by the Project Management Institute fo r his categorizat ion of PMOs \ninto “supportive,” “controlling,” and “directive” pr oject management offices.  ECF No. 380-1, \nPageID.16676-77, 16679-80 ¶¶  17, 18, 22 (citing A Guide to the Project Mgmt. Body of \nKnowledge , Project Mgmt. Inst. § 1.4.4 (5th ed. 2013)).   \n Trivett’s testimony does not repeat impermis sibly Tierney’s testimony, and he will not be \npermitted to do simply th at at trial.  His reliance on that  testimony is not improper.     \n Finally, the plaintiffs argue that Trivett’s testimony amounts to a legal conclusion when he \nstates that “at no time did CS G have the responsibility or authority to have committed the \n‘wrongful practice’ allege d by the plaintiffs.”   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 16 of 24-17- \n  The Federal Rules of Evidence make clear th at “[a]n opinion is not objectionable just \nbecause it embraces an ultimate issue.”  Fed. R. Evid. 704(a).  However, an expert witness may \nnot offer testimony “that expr esses a legal conclusion.”  Berry , 25 F.3d at 1354 (6th Cir. 1994).  \nThe court of appeals has explained that “there is a ‘subtle,’ but ‘nonetheless importa nt’ distinction \nbetween ‘opin[ing] on the ultimate question of lia bility’ (impermissible), a nd ‘stating opinions that \nsuggest the answer to the ultimate issue or that give the jury  all the informati on from which it can \ndraw inferences as to the ultimate issue’ (permissible).”  Babb v. Maryville Anesthesiologists P.C. , \n942 F.3d 308, 317 (6th Cir. 2019) (quoting Berry , 25 F.3d at 1353).  For ex ample, a court may not \n“‘allow a fingerprint expert in a criminal case to opine that the defendant was guilty (a legal \nconclusion)’” but can “‘allow him to opine that  the defendant’s fingerprint was the only one on \nthe murder wea pon (a fact).’” Ibid. (quoting Berry , 25 F.3d at 1353). \n Here, Trivett’s testimony that “CSG’s role was limited to the elicitation and documentation \nof the business rules, process flows, and decisi ons trees dictated by the State’s representatives” \nand that the “State had the ultima te responsibility and authority to  heed — or choose not to heed \n— CSG’s recommendations” is prop er, as it merely suggests the co nclusion that the fact finder \nshould reach.  But his opinion that “at no time did CSG have the respon sibility or authority to have \ncommitted the ‘wrongful practices’ alleged by the pl aintiffs” (i.e., due process violations) is an \nimpermissible legal conclusion, drawing not onl y on the contract documents but also an \ninterpretation of the parties’ ri ghts and responsibilities under the law of contract s.  Trivett will not \nbe allowed to give  that testimony.   \nIV. \n FAST and CSG move to bar the testimony if Christian Sandvig, a witn ess not identified by \nthe plaintiffs as a rebuttal witness because no  timely disclosure was given.  The plaintiffs Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 17 of 24-20- \n  Under  Rule 26, the report of a rebu ttal expert, that is, by one whose “evidence is intended \nsolely to contradict or rebut ev idence on the same subject matter identified by anot her party under \nRule 26(a)(2)(B) or (C),” must be disclosed within  30 days after the other party’s disclosure. Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(D)(ii).  By that measure, the disclosure, if incomplete, was nearly timely (one \nday late).  But generally, “rebuttal experts may not testify as to issues on which [the disclosing party] bears the burden of proof.”  UHS of Delaware, Inc. v. United Health Servs., Inc. , 2017 WL \n1945490, at *1 (M.D. Pa. May 10, 2017); see Taylor v. Brandon , 2018 WL 3581142, at *2 (W.D. \nKy. Jan. 30, 2018) (“‘[R]eal’ rebuttal appears to  be evidence or expert opinion offered by a \n[p]laintiff in response to  a defense theory or proof that ordi narily would not be offered by the \n[p]laintiff in its cas e-in-chief to establish an element of one  or more of its cau ses of action.”).  \nWhere a party attempts to introduce evidence establishing an  element of their claim through a \nrebuttal expert, preclusion of the testimony is th e proper remedy “absent a showing of substantial \njustification or harmlessness.”  Expeditors Int’l of Wash. v. Vastera, Inc. , No. 01-71000, 2004 WL \n6047123, at *2 (E.D. Mich. May 24, 2004) (citin g Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1)).    \n One of CSG’s and FAST’s main criticisms of the plaintiffs’ disclosu re of Sandvig is that \nthey believe it constitutes a backdoo r attempt at adding an expert to prove their case-in-chief.  The \ndisclosure also failed to include a report in the form required by Rule 26(a )(2)(B).  The plaintiffs \nrespond that the report requirement should be excu sed in this case because Sandvig had nothing to \nwork with due to the inadequate substance in th e defendants’ expert disclosures, which failed to \nsummarize any opinions.     The plaintiffs’ argument quite accurately describe s the state of the record in this case.  The \nnon-retained experts intend to  offer few, if any, opin ions.  The defendants will  rely on their special \nknowledge instead to allow them to explain the procedures and processes employed in applying Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 20 of 24-21- \n MiDAS to the fraud adjudications.  The plaintiffs’ primary complaint about those processes is that \nthey were deprived of notice, an opportunity to  be heard, and a fair he aring.  The non-retained \nexperts will offer no opinions on th ose points as such.  That subj ect matter, however, appears to \nbe Sandvig’s intended area of testimony.    The defendants made clear that they disclose d their non-retained expe rts in an abundance \nof caution, that they intend to use them primarily as fact witnesses, and that they only disclosed \nthem as non-retained experts if the Court were to  find that their testimony included expert opinions.  \nAs discussed above, the non-retained witnesses will not provide any expert opinions, with one or \ntwo minor exceptions, as they appear to only re lay the facts about which they had personal \nknowledge.  As discussed above, the only allowable opinions will come from the file examiners, \nwho will state that human claims examiners —not an auto-adjudication process — made the fraud \ndeterminations for the re spective plaintiffs.   However, Sandvig’s disclosure does not mention any \nof those proposed opinions.  Nor does Sandvig in tend to comment on anything J. Todd Trivett, \nCSG’s retained expert, intends to discuss.   \n It does not appear, therefore, that the plaintiffs intend to call Sandvig to rebut any opinions \nthat will be given by defense witnesses designate d as experts.  Instead, it appears that Sandvig \nintends to provide opinions that u ltimately support the plaintiffs’ ca se-in-chief.  For instance, he \nwill opine that MiDAS fails to incorporate impa rtial decision-making processes, that inherent \nbiases exist in MiDAS, MiDAS’s rules include predetermined outcomes,  and that MiDAS does \nnot weigh evidence.  Id. at PageiD.16605-06.  These generalized  opinions are not responsive to \nany offered opinions and improperl y bolster the plaintiffs’ argumen ts for which they carry the \nburden of proof, which is beyond the scope  of permissible re buttal testimony.   Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 21 of 24-22- \n  The only potentially responsiv e opinion Sandvig offers is th at MiDAS “adjudicates claims \nof potential claimant fr aud through its programming rules and l ogic.”  That testimony may rebut \nthe file examiners’ opinions that humans adjudicat ed the plaintiffs’ claims.  However, that opinion \nis not supported by the report re quired by Rule 26(a)(2)(B), wh ich must include the expert’s \nopinions, supporting facts and data, a nd other requirements.  The plai ntiffs argue that they were \nstymied by the defendants’ failure to describe their w itnesses’ intended op inion testimony in any \ndetail, but the opinions of those file examiners were described cl early enough in the disclosures.   \n When a party does not comply with the disclo sure requirements, the party “‘is not allowed \nto use’ the information or person that was not di sclosed ‘on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, \nunless the failure was substantiall y justified or is harmless.’”  Baker Hughes Inc.  v. S&S Chem., \nLLC, 836 F.3d 554, 567 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1 )).  According to the Sixth \nCircuit, “Rule 37(c)(1) mandates that a trial cour t sanction a party for di scovery violations in \nconnection with Rule 26(a) unless the violations were harmless or were substantially justified.”  \nSexton v. Uniroyal Chemi. Co. , 62 F. App’x 615, 616 n.1 (6th Cir. 2003).  “‘Rule 37 is written in \nmandatory terms and is designed to provide a st rong inducement for disclosure of Rule 26(a) \nmaterial.’”  Ibid. (quoting Ames v. Van Dyne , 100 F.3d 956, 1996 WL 662899, at *4 (6th Cir. Nov. \n13, 1996) (Table)).  The Sixth Circuit has identified five factors to consider when assessing whether a party's \nomitted or late disclosure is “substantially justified” or “harmless”: “‘(1) the surprise to the party \nagainst whom the evidence would be offered; (2) the ability of that party to  cure the surprise; (3) \nthe extent to which allowing the evidence woul d disrupt the trial; (4) the importance of the \nevidence; and (5) the nondisclosing party’s expl anation for its failure to disclose the \nevidence.’”  Howe v. City of Akron , 801 F.3d 718, 747-48 (6th Cir. 2015) (quoting Russell v. Abs. Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 22 of 24-23- \n Collection Servs., Inc. , 763 F.3d 385, 396-97 (4th Cir. 2014)).  None of those factors favor the \nplaintiffs.  The plaintiffs’ excuse for not furnis hing a report that rebuts the narrow scope of the \nopinion testimony disclosed by the defendants doe s not meet the substantial justification \nrequirement.  And the plaintiffs ha ve not shown how their decision to revive the participation of \ntheir expert after the defendants made  their disclosures is harmless.   \n Moreover, judging from the subj ect matter of the testimony th at Sandvig disclosed, he is \nnot a true rebuttal witness.  His testimony instead  would focus on one or more elements of the \nplaintiffs’ claims, more properly offered in their case-in-chief.  Taylor , 2018 WL 3581142, at *2.  \nThat makes the failure to serve a disclosure complete with a report more problematic.   \n “‘The exclusion of non-disclosed evid ence is automatic and mandatory under \nRule 37(c)(1) unless non-disclosure was justified or harmless.’”  Dickenson v. Cardiac & Thoracic \nSurgery of Eastern Tennessee , 388 F.3d 976, 983 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting Musser v. Gentiva \nHealth Services , 356 F.3d 751, 758 (7th Cir. 2004)).  “The party requesting exclusion under \nRule 37(c)(1) need not s how prejudice, rather the non-moving pa rty must show that the exclusion \nwas ‘harmless’ or ‘substantially justified.’”  Saint Gobain Autover USA, Inc. v. Xinyi Glass N. Am., \nInc., 666 F. Supp. 2d 820, 826 (N.D. Ohio 2009); see also  Roberts ex rel. Johnson v. Galen of \nVirginia, Inc. , 325 F.3d 776, 782 (6th Cir. 2003) (quoting Vance v. United States , No. 98-5488, \n1999 WL 455435, at *3 (6th Cir. June 25, 1999)).  The plaintiffs will not be pe rmitted to call Christian Sandvig as an expert witness.   \nV. \n FAST urges the Court to sanction the plainti ffs because they filed two sets of motions \nchallenging the expert testimony.  However, the motions serve different purposes, one set Case 2:17-cv-10657-DML-RSW   ECF No. 533, PageID.<pageID>   Filed 03/18/21   Page 23 of 24-24- \n addressing procedural issues and the other cha llenging the substance of the proposed expert \ntestimony.  Sanctions are not appropriate.   \n The defendants’ disclosures for the non-reta ined experts do not id entify any admissible \nopinion testimony except CSG’s disclo sures that the file examiners will opine that human claims \nexaminers, not an auto-adjudica tion process, made the fraud dete rminations.  Beyond that, the non-\nretained experts will not be perm itted to give opinion testimony.  They will be able to describe \ntheir interaction with MiDAS and how it was invol ved in the determination of the plaintiffs’ \nclaims, and the interaction of FA ST and CSG with the State in the development and application of \nMiDAS.  CSG’s retained expert may testify to hi s opinions except that which amounts to a legal \nconclusion.  Accordingly, it is ORDERED  that the plaintiffs’ motions to strike expert witness \ndisclosures (ECF No 345, 346, 348), a nd their motions to bar expert  witness testimony (ECF No. \n380, 381, 382) are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.   \n It is further ORDERED  that the motion by CSG and FAST  to preclude the plaintiffs’ \nexpert witness testimony (ECF No. 378) is GRANTED .   \n        s / D a v i d  M .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied Defendant Estes Carter Thompson III's motion to dismiss charges related to child sexual exploitation and possession of child pornography. The case involved the alleged use of Thompson’s cellphone to secretly record minors in airplane bathrooms and the possession of AI-generated images of child pornography discovered in Thompson's iCloud account. The court found the indictment sufficiently specific and held that venue was proper in Massachusetts where the plane landed, not just where the acts were initiated.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the indictment was sufficiently specific and stated a valid offense, whether the venue was proper in the District of Massachusetts, and the nature of the alleged conduct regarding the use of AI-generated images.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the indictment was sufficiently specific and stated a valid offense by adequately apprising Thompson of the charges against him. The venue in the District of Massachusetts was proper as the crime involved interstate transportation, making the landing district suitable for trial. The allegations about AI images did not form the basis of the charges and thus did not affect the indictment's validity.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're on an airplane, and a staff member uses hidden cameras to record people in the bathroom—that’s what the defendant is accused of, along with having creepy computer-made child pictures. He argued that the court papers weren’t clear about what he's being accused of, and that the case shouldn't be tried in Massachusetts because the plane only landed there. The judge said no to both points because the papers were clear enough, and since the plane landed in Massachusetts, it's a good place for the trial.",

The government alleges that, while working as a flight attendant, \nThompson escorted a fourteen- year-old passenger  from the main cabin to a first- class bathroom of \nthe airplane and, utilizing  a cellphone that he had attached to the toilet seat  lid, sought to secretly \nrecord her using the toilet. It also alleges that a subsequent search of Thompson’s iCloud account \nuncovered videos of other minors using airplane  bathrooms , as a well as  sexually explicit images \nof children  apparently created through an artificial intelligence (“AI”) website.  \nPending before the Court is Thompson’s motion  to dismiss the indictment. He contends  \nthat the indictment lacks sufficient specificity  and fails to state an offense, and that venue in the Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 1 of 192 District of Massachusetts is improper . For the reasons that follow , the Court disagrees and will \ndeny his motion  to dismiss.  \nBACKGROUND \nThe f\nollowing facts, drawn from “the allegations of the indictment and the unchallenged \nstatement of proof of the prosecutor ,” are “accepted as true ” for purposes of the motion to dismiss. \nUnited States v. Ferris , 807 F.2d 269, 271 (1st Cir. 1986). \nOn September 2, 2023, Thompson was working as an American Airlines flight attendant \non a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina to Boston, Massachusetts. ECF 4- 1, ¶ 6. About halfway \nthrough the flight, a fourteen -year-old girl, “Minor A,” was waiting to use the bathroom in the \nmain cabin. Id.  ¶¶ 6, 7(a). A male flight attendant, later identified as Thompson, approached her, \ntold her that she could use the first -class bathroom , and escorted her there. Id.  ¶ 7(a). He then  \nexplained that the toilet seat was broken and that he had to wash his hands in the bathroom before \nshe could use it. Id.  Once Thompson finished using the bathroom , Minor A  entered and  observed \nred stickers on the underside of the open lid of the toilet seat. Id. ¶¶ 7(a) -(b). The stickers  read \n“INOPE RATIVE CATERING EQUIPMENT” and “REMOVE FROM SERVICE ,” and one of \nthe stickers bore a handwritten note stating , “SEAT BROKEN.” Id. ¶¶ 7(a), (b), (f). Minor A  \nremoved or pulled down her shorts and underwear to use the toilet. Id.  ¶ 7(b). When Minor A was \ndone, she got dressed, flushed the toilet, and then noticed an iPhone that was illuminated and \nprotruding from underneath the stickers. Id.  ¶¶ 7(c), (f). She took a picture of the scene on her \nphone. Id. After Minor A exited, Thompson jumped in front of a waiting first-class passenger and \nreentered the bathroom. Id. ¶¶ 7(d), 11 -12. \nWhen Minor A returned to her seat, she showed her mother  the photograph of the toilet \nseat and explained what had happened. Id. ¶ 7(d). Minor A’s mother told a flight attendant and Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 2 of 193 Minor A’s father about the incident. Id. ¶¶ 13- 15. Minor A’s father approached the other three \nflight attendants, including Thompson, who was the only male  flight attendant  on board, and \ndemanded to see Thompson’s phone. Id. ¶¶ 7(e), 15-16. Thompson retrieved his iPhone from his \nsuitcase in the overhead bin and scrolled through it for ten to fifteen seconds before Minor A’s \nfather grab bed it. Id. ¶ 16. Once Thompson unlocked his iPhone, another flight attendant reviewed \nhis photos app and observed content in it, but was unable to determine what was  displayed in the \nimages.  Id. ¶¶ 17- 18. She and one of  the other flight attendant s notified the captain about the \nsituation , which was conveyed to law enforcement on the ground. Id. ¶ 19. Thompson then locked \nhimself in the first- class bathroom for three to five minutes and exited as the flight was beginning \nits descent. Id. ¶ 20.       \nTroopers from the Massachusetts State Polic e spoke with Thompson when the plane \nlanded. Id. ¶ 21. Thompson consented to an initial search of his iPhone. Id.  One of the  troopers \nfound that Thompson’s iPhone contained no  photos, videos, text messages, or phone calls , and it \nappeared to  have been restored to  its factory settings. Id.  The phone did display Thompson’s name \nand was actively linked to an Apple iCloud account with an Apple ID email address. Id. The \nFederal Bureau of Investigation ( “FBI”) retained Thompson’s iPhone and suitcase in its  custody \npending its application s for a search warrant. Id.  ¶ 22. \nSeventeen days later, o n September 19, 2023, the FBI obtained search warrant s for \nThompson’s iPhone, suitcase, and iCloud account. Id.  ¶¶ 23 -25. Upon executing the search \nwarrants, officers  discovered eleven red stickers in Thompson’s suitcase, like the ones that Minor \nA had observed in the first -class bathroom. Id. ¶ 23. O fficers  also confirmed that , while connected \nto the airplane’s Wi -Fi, Thompson’s iPhone had been reset to factory settings  by the Apple ID \nlinked with Thompson’s iCloud account  approximately thirty  minutes after Minor A took a picture Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 3 of 194 of the upturned toilet seat. Id. ¶ 24. The search of Thompson’s iCloud account revealed, among \nother things, recordings and pictures of four additional  minors in air plane bathrooms , with the ir \nbuttocks and genital ia visible . Id. ¶¶ 26 -45. The iCloud account also contained sexually explicit \nimages of children  that appeared to have been AI generated. Id.  ¶ 47. \nIn January 2024, Thompson was arrested in the Western District of Virginia and charged \nby criminal complaint in the District of Massachusetts with two counts: sexual exploitation and  \nattempted exploitation of children , in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2251(a) and (e) (Count One ), and \npossession and attempted possession of child pornography depicting a prepubescent minor , in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § § 2252A(a)(5)(B)  and (b)(2 ) (Count Two) . ECF 4, 6, 7. Thompson was \nindicted on the same charges on April 25, 2024. ECF 16, 19. On October 11, 2024, Thompson \nmoved to dismiss the indictment. ECF 48. After receiving the government ’s oppos ition and \nThompson’s reply, the Court held a hearing on the motion on November 20, 2024. ECF 51, 54, \n57. \nDISCUSSION  \nI. Sufficiency of the Indictment . \n Thompson contends that the indictment’s lack of specificity violates Federal Rule of \nCriminal Procedure 7(c)(1), his Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy, and his \nSixth Amendment right to notice of “ the nature and cause of the accusation” against him. Under \nRule 7(c)(1 ), which effectuates th ose constitutional protections, a n indictment  must contain “a \nplain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). To satisfy these requirement s, the indictment “ need only outline \n‘the elements of the crime and the nature of the charge so that the defendant can prepare a defense \nand plead double jeopardy in any future prosecution for the same offense.’” United States v. Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 4 of 195 Stepanets , 879 F.3d 367, 372 (1st Cir. 2018)  (quoting United States v. Guerrier , 669 F.3d 1, 3 (1st \nCir. 2011)). Instructive here, the First Circuit held  in United States v. Cameron that a sixteen -count \nindictment charging child pornography- related offenses  was “sufficient ” because “each count of \nthe indictment included . . . a description of the offense that tracks the language of the relevant \nstatute, the date of the offense, the type of child pornography involved (digital images), and the \nmeans by which [the defendant ] either transported (for example, by uploading to a specified \nYahoo! Photos album), received, or possessed the child pornography in question.” 699 F.3d 621, \n635 (1st Cir. 2012).  The indictment in this case is sufficiently specific about the two charges  against Thompson. \nCount One  describes  the alleged  sexual exploitation or attempted exploitation of children offense \nin language that tracks  the language of 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a); provides the date of the offense  as \n“[o]n or about September 2, 2023”;  specifies the location of  the offense as  “the District of \nMassachusetts, and elsewhere”; and identifies the  victim as “‘Minor A’ (YOB 2009) .” ECF 19, at \n1-2; see United States v. Poulin, 588 F. Supp. 2d 64, 66- 67 (D. Me. 2008)  (upholding a similar \nindictment charging a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 225 1(a)). Thompson nonetheless maintains that \nCount One  improperly repeats generic statutory language without any supporting factual \nallegations about, for example, what he did to employ, use, persuade, induce, entice, or  coerce \nMinor A  under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) . Rule 7(c)(1) do es not require  such specificity.  An indictment \nneed only “ ‘apprise the defendant of the charged offense, ’” not force “ ‘the government [to] \npresen [t] enough evidence to support the charge.’ ” United States v. Ngige , 780 F.3d 497, 502 (1st \nCir. 2015) ( quoting United States v. Savarese , 686 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.  2012) ). Count One  is “legally \nsufficient ” because it “tracks [the]  statute ’s terms ” and “ gives [Thompson] adequate notice of the \ncharg [e]” against him.  Stepanets , 879 F.3d at 372. Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 5 of 196 Count Two likewise  describes  the possession or attempted possession of child pornography \noffense in language that tracks  18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) ; identifies the date of the offense as \n“[o]n or about September 2, 2023”; states  that the offense occurred in “Massachusetts, and \nelsewhere”; and explains that the offense “involved a prepubescent minor and a minor who had \nnot attained 12 years of age .” ECF 19, at 3. In Thompson’s view, Count Two is insufficiently \nspecific because it does not identify the means by which he allegedly possessed child pornography. \nIn Cameron, the indictment additional ly specified  that the defendant possessed “digital images ” in \na “Yahoo! Photos album .” 699 F.3d at 635. But Cameron he ld that these details were  “sufficient,” \nnot necessary, to apprise the defendant of the nature of the charge  pending against him. See id. \nNor, contrary to Thompson’s argument, does Rule 7(c)(1) require the indictment to identify the specific images of child p ornography he allegedly possessed or attempted to possess. See id.  \n(rejecting the argument that Rule 7(c)(1) “ requires such specificity ” about “ the specific images \nthat [the]  offense was based on ”). Count Two, like Count One , provides Thompson with adequate  \nnotice of the time, place, and manner of the charged offense , such that he “‘can prepare a defense \nand plead double jeopardy in any future prosecution for the same offense.’ ” United States v. \nRodríguez- Rivera , 918 F.3d 32, 34 (1st Cir. 2019) (quoting Stepanets , 879 F.3d at  372).   \nThompson separately  contends that the indictment fails to  specify whether Count Two is \npremised on photos and videos of minor children taken on airplanes , or instead on AI -generated \nchild pornography. But the indictment refers specifically to “ one and more images of . . . a \nprepubescent minor and a minor who had not attained 12 years of age.” ECF 19, at 3. The relevant statute, in turn, defines “minor” as “ any person  under the age of eighteen years .” 18 U .S.C. \n§ 2256(1) (emphasis added). T he indictment  thus gives Thompson adequate notice that the images \nin question involve a real minor, not one generated by artificial intelligence . Indeed, settled case Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 6 of 197 law establish es that, in a prosecution for a child pornography offense, the government “must prove \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the image is of an actual child in order to establish guilt.”  United \nStates v. Rodriguez -Pacheco , 475 F.3d 434, 439 (1st Cir. 2007); see also Ashcroft v. Free Speech \nCoal., 535 U.S. 234, 250 (2002); United States v. LaFortune , 520 F.3d 50, 53- 54 (1st Cir. 2008). \nAnd c onsistent with the indictment, the government asserts in opposing the motion to dismiss  that \nCount Two is not based on any AI-generated images. ECF 51, at 7 n.4. \nThompson alternatively requests that , even if the indictment is sufficient,  the government \nbe ordered to produce a bill of particulars. Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f), “[t]he \ncourt may direct the government to file a bill of particulars.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(f). A motion for a bill of particulars should “be granted only if the accused, in the absence of a more detailed specification, will be disabled from preparing a defense, caught by unfair surprise at trial, or hampered in seeking the shelter of the Double Jeopardy Clause.” United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1192- 93 (1st Cir. 1993). In determining whether to grant a request for a bill of \nparticulars , courts can consider what the government has produced beyond the indictment itself. \nSee United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez , 319 F.3d 12, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2003). \nThompson seeks a bill of particulars that provides specific factual allegations about which \nof his actions form the basis for the two charged offenses and what conduct occurred in Massachusetts. But, as explained, the indictment adequately apprises Thompson of the nature of \nthe charges. He has also been able to review the criminal complaint and accompanying affidavit, the discovery provided, and the government’s brief on this motion. In light of these materials, Thompson is “not lack[ing] a fair opportunity to prepare a defense absent a bill of particulars.” Id.  \nat 31. Given that more information is not “necessary to enable him to prepare his defense, to avoid Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 7 of 198 surprise at trial, [or] to protect against double jeopardy,” Thompson’s request for a bill of \nparticulars is denied. United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 154 (1st Cir. 1989).  \nII. Failure to State an Offense.  \n Thompson next contends that the indictment fails to state an offense because, as a matter \nof law, surreptitious recordings of children using the toilet do not  involve “sexually explicit \nconduct.” The statute under which Thompson is charged in Count One  provides, in relevant part, \nthat “[a] ny person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage \nin . . . any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such \nconduct or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished \nas provided under subsection (e).” 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a). The statute under which Thompson is \ncharged in  Count Two criminalizes knowing possession of , or knowing access with intent to view , \n“child pornography.” Id. § 2252A(a)(5)(B). “Child pornography”  is, in turn, defined as “any visual \ndepiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer -generated \nimage or picture, . . . of sexually explicit conduct, where . . . the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.” Id.  § 2256(8)(A). \nBoth counts thus require the images or recordings at issue to depict “sexually explicit conduct.”\n1  \n T he term “sexually explicit conduct” is  defined, in relevant part , as “lascivious exhibition \nof the anus, genitals, or pubic area of any person.” Id.  § 2256(2)(A) (v). The phrase “lascivious \nexhibition” is not itself defined by statute, but the First Circuit has described it as a “commonsensical term.” United States v. Charriez -Rolón, 923 F.3d 45, 52 (1st Cir. 2019)  \n \n1 Both counts also charge attempt under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(e) and 18 U.S.C. § 2252A(b)(2), \nrespectively. “‘To prove attempt, the government must establish both an intent to commit  the \nsubstantive offense and a substantial step towards its commission.’” United  States v. Turner , 501 \nF.3d 59, 68 (1st  Cir. 2007) (quoting United  States v.  Burgos , 254 F.3d 8, 12  (1st Cir. 2001) ). Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 8 of 199 (quotation marks omitted) . Although “there is no exclusive list of factors . . . that must be met for \nan image (or a film) to be lascivious,” the following factors, dubbed the “ Dost -factors” based on \nthe case that first enumerated them,2 are generally relevant:  \n(1) whether the genitals or pubic area are the focal point of the image; (2) whether \nthe setting of the image is sexually suggestive (i.e., a location generally associated \nwith sexual activity); (3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose or \ninappropriate attire considering her [or his] age; (4) whether the child is fully or \npartially clothed, or nude; (5) whether the image suggests sexual coyness or \nwillingness to engage in sexual activity; and (6) whether the image is intended or \ndesigned to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. \n \nId. (quotation marks omitted). These factors are not, however, “ comprehensive [o]r necessarily \napplicable in every situation.” United States v. Amirault , 173 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1999). N ot every \nfactor must be present for a depiction to be lascivious, see United States v. Frabizio, 459 F.3d 80, \n90 (1st Cir. 2006), and “there may be other factors that are equally if not more important ,” \nAmirault , 173 F.3d at 32. In all instances, the inquiry is case- specific.  \n Thompson’s contention that the indictment fails to charge lascivious exhibition relies on \nthe D.C. Circuit’s decision in United States v. Hillie , 14 F.4th 677 (D.C. Cir. 2021). The Court in \nHillie  construed the statutory phrase “lascivious exhibition” against the backdrop of a string of \nSupreme Court decisions —New York v. Ferber , 458 U.S. 747 (1982), United States v. X -Citement \nVideo, Inc., 513 U.S. 64 (1994), and United States v. Williams , 553 U.S. 285 (2008) —involving \nFirst Amendment overbreadth and other challenges to statutes that regulate child pornography. See  \nHillie , 14 F.4th at 684 -88. As the D.C. Circuit understood those decisions, to avoid an overbreadth \nproblem, statutes criminalizing possession of images depicting “lascivious exhibition” must \nregulate only the “‘the hard core of child pornography.’” Id.  at 686 (quoting Ferber , 458 U.S. at \n \n2 See United States v. Dost , 636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986), aff’d sub nom. United \nStates v. Wiegand, 812 F.2d 1239, 1244 (9th Cir. 1987). Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 9 of 1910 764-65). In accordance with that understanding, the majority opinion in Hillie  construed the phrase \n“lascivious exhibition” to “cover visual depictions in which a minor, or someone interacting with \na minor, engages in conduct displaying their anus, genitalia, or pubic area in a lustful manner that \nconnotes the commission of sexual i ntercourse, bestiality, masturbation, or sadistic or masochistic \nabuse.” Id. at 687. And it determined that because the Dost  factors did not align with its statutory \nconstruction, trial courts should not instruct the jury on the Dost factors as a matter of course, but \nthat evidence pertaining to the Dost factors may be relevant and admissible at trial. Id.  at 691 -93. \nApplying its statutory construction, the Hillie majority  then vacated convictions for sexual \nexploitation of a minor and possession of images of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, \nwhere the defendant had secretly recorded videos of children using the toilet and undressing in a \nbedroom, with genitalia exposed, because the images did not depict “any sexual conduct \nwhatsoever, or any activity connoting a sex act.” Id. at 688-89, 692-95. \nThompson’s reliance on Hillie to attack the indictment in this case falters for procedural \nand substantive reasons. Procedurally, his argument is premature. The First Circuit has held that \n“it is up to the jury ” to determine whether a particular image or video depicts sexually explicit \nconduct, including lascivious exhibition. Frabizio, 459 F.3d at 85 (emphasis in original). In \nFrabizio, the Court reversed a judge’s pretrial determination that three images did not depict \n“lascivious exhibition” of the genitals or pubic area. 459 F.3d at 83-91. The record presently before \nthis Court —which does not contain the images and video recordings discovered in Thompson’s \niCloud account —is even more limited than the record before the trial judge in Frabizio. And even \nthough the trial judge there had reviewed the images in dispute, the First Circuit emphasized that \n“whether a given depiction is lascivious is a question of fact for the jury.” Id. at 85. Indeed, to the \nFirst Circuit’s knowledge  at the time , no court of appeals had “ever approved the use of the Dost Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 10 of 1911 factors in a pretrial proceeding to remove the consideration of the lasciviousness of an image from \nthe jury.” Id.  at 88. As in Frabizio, it will be for the jury to determine whether the government can \nmeet its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt  that the images and videos  in Thompson’s \niCloud account involve lascivious exhibition. \nSubstantively, even if it were proper for the Court to consider at this juncture whether, as \na matter of law, secretly recorded depictions of a child using the toilet can be lascivious, \nThompson’s reliance on Hillie  runs up against  First Circuit precedent.  Recall that the majority in \nHillie  construed “lascivious exhibition” to require the display of genitalia “in a lustful manner that \nconnotes the commission of sexual intercourse.” 14 F.4th at 687. And even though the majority \nrejected the wholesale application of the Dost  factors, it explained that “evidence pertaining to the \nfifth Dost  factor, that the visual depiction suggest s sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in \nsexual activity, may substantially overlap with the [statutory] construction” it  had adopted. Id. at \n692 (quotation marks and citation omitted). The dissenting opinion, in contrast , “emphatically \ndisagree[d]” that “the statute requires  the minor victim to exhibit a ‘lustful manner.’” Id. at 702 \n(Henderson, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). Such a construction, the dissent  argued, \nundercuts Congress’s aim to protect children from the psychological, emotional, and dignitary \nharms inflicted by sexual exploitation. See id.  \n The First Circuit, like the dissenting opinion in Hillie , does  not read  “lascivious exhibition” \nto require that the visual depiction involve the display of genitalia in a lustful manner or suggest \nsexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity. In Frabizio, the First Circuit rejected the proposition that the fifth Dost  factor —whether  the depiction of the  minor suggest s sexual \ncoyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity—was necessary to sustain a conviction \ninvolving lascivious exhibition. See 459 F.3d at 88- 89. “The absence of a sexual come- on,” the Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 11 of 1912 First Circuit explained, “does not mean that an image is not lascivious.” Id. at 89. Frabizio, like \nHillie , engaged with the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Ferber and X-Citement Video . Id. at 83-85. \nBut Frabizio concluded that  “‘a sexually exploitative photograph of a child need not portray the \nvictim in a pose that depicts lust, wantonness, sexual coyness or other inappropriate precocity.’” \nId. at 89 (quoting United States v. Wolf , 890 F.2d 241, 247 (10th Cir. 1989)) (quotation marks \nomitted); see also United States v. Goodman, 971 F.3d 16, 18- 19 (1st Cir. 2020) (concluding, on \nplain error review, that images depicting a child’s genitalia while she entered and exited the shower supplied a sufficient factual foundation for the defendant’s guilty plea under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) for sexual exploitation of a minor). Thus, the First Circuit’s decision in Frabizio forecloses \nThompson’s argument that this Court should embrace Hillie ’s statutory construction and hold, as \na matter of law, that depictions of a child’s genitalia while using the toilet cannot constitute “lascivious exhibition.”  Thompson’s request that the indictment be dismissed for failure to state \nan offense is denied. III. Venue.  \n Thompson’s final  conten tion is  that venue in the District of Massachusetts, the district in \nwhich the airplane landed, is improper. The parties agree, based on discovery provided by the government , that the airplane was flying over New Jersey airspace when Thompson escorted \nMinor A to the first -class bathroom and Minor A  noticed  the iPhone taped to the upturned lid of \nthe toilet seat. Based on that discovery, Thompson argues that the venue clauses of Article III and \nthe Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as well as Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 18, require any charges to be brought against him in the District of New Jersey, not the District of Massachusetts. The government maintains that its decision to bring charges in the District of \nMassachusetts, the landing jurisdiction, is consistent with the Constitution and Rule 18, and is Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 12 of 1913 specifically authorized by 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a). The government bears the burden to prove, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that venue is proper as to each count in the indictment. See United \nStates v. Salinas , 373 F.3d 161, 163 (1st Cir. 2004).  \nA. Const itutio nal Provisions. \n The Court begins with the question whether, in a case involving an alleged crime on a \ncommercial  aircraft, the Constitution requires the government to charge the defendant only in the \ndistrict whose airspace bears the closest nexus to the conduct underlying the crime, rather than the \ndistrict in which the airplane lands. The Constitution twice protects a criminal defendant’s right to  \nbe tried in an appropriate venue . Article II I, Section 2 provides that a criminal tria l “shall be held \nin the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any \nState, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.” U.S. \nCONST . art. III, § 2, cl. 3. The Si xth Amendment further provides that “[i]n all criminal \nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of \nthe State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been \npreviously ascertained by law.” U.S. C ONST . amend. VI. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 18 \nechoes  those rights , providing that “[u]nless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the \ngovernment must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed. The court \nmust set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant, \nany victim, and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice.” \n Thompson’s argument that any charges against him must be brought in the flyover district, \nnot the landing district, cannot be squared with the text, history, and purpose of these provisions. \nConstruing the text of Article III and the Sixth Amendment, as well as English common law and \nFounding- era historical sources, the Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution does not Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 13 of 1914 insist on only one district as the proper venue for a criminal trial. See Palliser v. United States , 136 \nU.S. 257, 265-66 (1890).  In Palliser  v. United States , the Supreme Court explained that:  \nWhere a crime is committed partly in one district and partly in another it must, in \nord\ner to prevent an absolute failure of justice, be tried in either district, or in that \none which the legislature may designate; and congress has accordingly provided that, “when any offense against the United States is begun in one judicial district \nand completed in any other, it shall be deemed to have been committed in either, and may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined, and punished in either district, in the same manner as if it had been actually and wholly committed therein.”  \nId. at 266 (quoting Rev. St at. § 731 (1878) , 28 U.S.C. § 103 (1890) (now codified at 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3237(a) )). The Court has  also recognized the constitutionality of a continuing violation theory, \n“where a crime consists of distinct parts which have different localities,” or “where it may be said \nthere is a continuously moving act, commencing with the offender and hence ultimately consummated through him, as the mailing of a letter; or where there is a confederation in purpose between two or more persons, its execution being by acts elsewhere, as in conspiracy.” United  \nStates v.  Lombardo, 241 U.S. 73, 77 (1916). In such circumstances, the defendant may  be tried in \nany district in which part of the crime occurred. Id. at 78 ; accord Salinas , 373 F.3d at 164. The \nConstitution does not require that venue be set in only one district.  T he text and Founding- era history of Article III and the Sixth Amendment have less to say \nabout the context in which this case arises: involving a commercial aircraft, flying miles over Earth  \nat a high speed while en route from one state to another. See United States v. Lozoya, 982 F.3d 648, 651 (9th Cir. 2020) (en banc) (“The Constitution does not discuss the airspace over the several states.”). But the purpose of the constitutional provisions bear s directly on Thompson’s argument \nthat the District of New Jersey is the constitutionally mandated  venue. The Framers safeguarded \nvenue rights in Article III and the Sixth Amendment in reaction to the  colonial- era practice \n“permit t[ing] Americans, charged with a crime on colonial soil, to be moved to England or another Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 14 of 1915 colony for trial.” United  States v. Muhammad, 502 F.3d 646, 651 (7th Cir. 2007) (citing D. \nKershen, Vicinage , 29 O KLA. L. REV. 803, 805 (1976)); see also United States v. Cabrales , 524 \nU.S. 1, 6 (1998) (noting that the Founders’ “complaints against the King of Great Britain, listed in \nthe Declaration of Independence, included his transportation of colonists ‘beyond Seas to be \ntried’”).  They sought to “‘secure the party accused from being dragged to a trial in some distant \nstate, away from his friends, witnesses, and neighborhood.’” Muhammad, 502 F.3d at 652 (quoting J. Story, C\nOMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION  § 925 (Carolina Academic Press reprint 1987) \n(1833)); accord Lozoya, 982 F.3d at 651 (majority op inion) ; id. at 659 (Ikuta, J., dissenting in part \nand concurring in the judgment). P rotection against trial in an arbitrary location —one lacking any \nconnection to the defendant, witnesses, or victims of a crime —sits at the heart of the constitutional \nprovisions and Rule 18.   Holding that these provisions require venue in this case to be set in the flyover District of \nNew Jersey, and do not permit venue in the landing District of Massachusetts, would frustrate \nthese aims. The conduct underlying the indictment took place on an airplane traveling from North Carolina to Massachusetts, and Thompson was first questioned by law enforcement officials in Massachuse tts. Under the circumstances, the defendant, victims, and witnesses are more likely to \nhave a connection to the departure  and landing S tates than the S tate over which the airplane \nhappened to be traveling when the crimes allegedly occurred. New Jersey has no apparent connection to Thompson, Minor A, any of the other alleged victims, or the witnesses to the case. The rule Thompson urges —that venue in the flyover district is required by the Constitution and  \nRule 18—would undermine, rather than support, the protections he invokes. See Lozoya , 982 F.3d \nat 652.  Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 15 of 1916 The Court thus concludes that the Constitution does not require venue in this case to be set \nin the District of New Jersey .3 The constitutional command that the trial “shall be held in the State \nwhere the said Crimes shall have been committed ” is broad enough to encompass the landing \njurisdiction when a crime is committed on a  commercial  aircraft . U.S. C ONST . art. III, § 2, cl. 3 ; \nsee also U.S. C ONST . amend. VI  (trial in the “district wherein the crime shall have been \ncommitted ”). T he government’s choice to bring charges in the District of Massachusetts, the \nlanding district, is compatible with Article III, the Sixth Amendment, and Rule 18 of the Federal \nRules of Criminal Procedure.  \nB. Statutory Provisions. \n The question remains whether venue in the District of Massachusetts is permissible under \nthe relevant venue statutes. The statutes Thompson is charged with violating—18 U.S.C. §§ 2251(a) and (e) and 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2 )—do not have their own venue \nprovisions. Venue for the prosecution must  therefore  be determined “‘from the nature of the crime \nalleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it.’” United  States v. Seward, 967 F.3d 57, \n60 (1st Cir. 2020) (quoting United  States v. Anderson, 328 U.S. 699, 703 (1946)); see also United  \nStates v. Rodriguez-Moreno, 526 U.S. 275, 279 (1999). The parties point to different statutes that, \nthey say, set the proper venue: the government contends that the second paragraph  of 18 U.S.C. \n§ 3237(a) applies, while Thompson argues that 18 U.S.C. § 3238 applies.  \n The statute Thompson relies on, s ection 3238, provides, in relevant part, that “[t] he trial of \nall offenses begun or committed upon the high seas, or elsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any \nparticular State or district, shall be in the district in which the offender  . . . is arrested or is first \n \n3 In so holding, the Court does not conclude that venue in the District of New Jersey would be \nconstitutionally impermissible. It holds only that venue in the District of New Jersey is not \nconstitutionally required. Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 16 of 1917 brought.” 18 U.S.C. § 3238. Under section 3238, Thompson contends, he cannot be tried in the \nDistrict of Massachusetts because he was not first arrested in this district. But by its plain terms, \nsection 3238 applies only to trials for “offenses begun or committed upon the high seas, or \nelsewhere out of the jurisdiction of any particular State or district .” Id. The statute does not apply \nto crimes committed within the borders of, and by extension in the airspace above, the S tates and \nUnited States . See Unite d States v. Ghanem , 993 F.3d 1113, 1119 (9th Cir. 2021) (“[F]or crimes \ncommitted outside the country , the Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the \nvenue for trial. U.S.  CONST . art. III, § 2, cl. 3. In turn, Congress has determined that the trial for \nsuch a crime ‘ shall be in the district in which the offender . . . is arrested or is first brought.’ ” \n(emphasis  added)  (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3238)). Section 3238 functions instead to implement the \nportion of Article III, Section 2 providing that when offenses are “ not committed within any State, \nthe Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.” U.S. C ONST . \nart. III, § 2, cl. 3; see Reid v. Covert , 354 U.S. 1, 7- 8 & n.9 (1957) (citing section 3238 in explaining \nthat “[f] rom the very first Congress, federal statutes have implemented the provisio[n]” of Article \nIII, Section 2 covering offenses “not committed within any State”).  \n Section 3237(a), in contrast, authorizes venue in the District of Massachusetts. It provides \nthat “[a] ny offense involving the use of the mails, transportation in interstate or foreign commerce, \nor the importation of an object or person into the United States is a continuing offense and, except \nas otherwise expressly provided by enactment of  Congress, may be inquired of and prosecuted in \nany district from, through, or into which such commerce, mail matter, or imported object or person \nmoves.” 18 U.S.C. § 323 7(a). Three  Courts of Appeals  have concluded  that this provision “applies  \nto in-flight crimes  because the crimes  took place on a form  of transportation in interstate  \ncommerce.” Lozoya, 982 F.3d at 653 (quotation marks  omitted); accord  United  States v. Cope , Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 17 of 1918 676 F.3d 1219, 1225 (10th  Cir. 2012);  United  States v. Breitweiser , 357 F.3d 1249, 1253 (11th \nCir. 2004). The Court agrees  with the analyses  in these cases.  Thompson’s alleged  crimes  \n“involv[e]” transportation in interstate  commerce  because the indictment is premised  on conduct \nthat took place on a form  of transportation, an aircraft,  that moved in interstate  commerce.  18 \nU.S.C. § 3237(a).  Moreover,  the conduct in this case relates  to that transportation. By virtue of his \nemployment as a flight attendant  on a commercial  airline,  Thompson had the means  and allegedly  \nused his position of authority  (1) to  “emplo[y] , us[e], persuad [e], induc [e], entic [e], or coerc [e]” \nMinor A to use a bathroom in a different  part of the aircraft  before seeking  to make a sexually \nexplicit recording  of her with his iPhone camera,  id. § 2251(a) , and  (2) to possess or attempt to \npossess sexually explicit images and videos of children using airplane bathrooms, id. \n§ 2252A(a)(5)(B) ; cf. Cameron, 699 F.3d at 636 (transporting and receiving child pornography via \nthe internet are continuing offenses under the second paragraph  of § 3237(a)).  But for the interstate  \ntransportation, the conduct that underlies the charges  against  Thompson could  not have occurred.  \nSee Lozoya, 982 F.3d at 653.4  \nBecause the charged  offenses  in this case involve transportation in interstate  commerce,  \nthe offenses  “may be inquired of and prosecuted in any district from, through, or into which such \ncommerce . . . moves ,” including the landing district. 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a). The Court thus \nconcludes the venue is  proper in  the District of Massachusetts for both offenses.5  \n \n4 Thompson contends that the second  paragraph  in section  3237(a) should be construed  as a \nsubset of the first paragraph  in section  3237(a), which  involves “ any offense against the United \nStates begun in one district and completed in another, or committed in more than one district.” But \nthere is  no indication in the text, structure, or  legislative  history of section 3237(a) that Congress \nintended to make the second paragraph  a subset of , or limited by,  the first, and the Court is aware \nof no case that so holds. See Lozoya , 982 F.3d at 652 (“ 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a) contains two \nparagraphs, each  covering  a different  type of offense.”).  \n5 Because the Court concludes that venue in the District of Massachusetts is proper for both \ncounts of the indictment under the second paragraph  of 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a), it need not reach the Case 1:24-cr-10107-JEK     Document 63     Filed 12/18/24     Page 18 of 1919 CONCLUSION AND ORDER \nFor the foregoing reasons, Thompson’s motion  to dismiss the indictment, ECF 4 8, is \nDENIED.  \nSO ORDERED.  \n/s/ Julia E.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The Federal Circuit Court dealt with an appeal by Dr. Ahmad Aljindi regarding the dismissal of his lawsuit by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. Dr. Aljindi sought $32.7 million for claims including employment discrimination, intellectual property and copyright violations, negligence, and torts, but the Court of Federal Claims dismissed the case due to lack of jurisdiction. The appellate court affirmed most of the dismissal but vacated and remanded the copyright claim for further consideration. The case involves AI, as Dr. Aljindi claimed his intellectual property related to AI was stolen by the Department of Defense.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Court of Federal Claims had jurisdiction over Dr. Aljindi's claims, including employment discrimination, intellectual property theft, negligence, torts, and judicial misconduct.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Federal Circuit affirmed the Court of Federal Claims' dismissal of Dr. Aljindi's claims due to lack of jurisdiction, except for the possible copyright infringement claim. The appellate court vacated this part of the dismissal and remanded it for the trial court to determine if Dr. Aljindi's complaint adequately stated a claim of copyright infringement.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Dr. Ahmad Aljindi tried to sue the U.S. government for a lot of money, claiming they did things like stealing his ideas and discriminating against him. The special court he went to, called the Court of Federal Claims, said they couldn't even look at most of his claims because they don't have that power; it's kind of like going to a car mechanic to fix a computer—it doesn't work. An important court agreed with that, but they told the lower court to take one more look at whether Dr. Aljindi might actually have a case for someone copying his creations, sort of like a homework assignment not being graded because it might belong somewhere else.",

Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 1     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 2 \nDr. Ahmad Aljindi appeals the final decision of the U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims dismissing his complaint for lack \nof jurisdiction.  For the reasons below, we affirm -in-part, \nvacate -in-part, and rem and.   \nBACKGROUND  \nOn April 28, 2021, Dr. Aljindi filed a complaint pro se \nat the Court of Federal Claims.  Dr. Aljindi sought $32.7 million in damages for employment discrimination in \naddition to relief for “intellectual property and copyright [] \nlaw[] violations, negligence, and tort.”  SAppx.  9.\n1  The \nGovernment moved to dismiss Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint for \nlack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.   \nThe Court of Federal Claims agreed with the Govern-\nment and dismissed Dr. Aljindi’s complaint.   See Aljindi \nv. United States, No. 21 -1295C, 2021 WL 4807205 (Fed.  Cl. \nOct. 15, 2021); SAppx. 1– 3.  The court interpreted \nDr. Aljindi’s complaint as alleging three claims:   (1) em-\nployment discrimination; (2)  theft of his intellectual prop-\nerty;\n2 and (3)  negligence and tort based on the conduct \ndescribed in his complaint for the first two claims .  \nSAppx.  1.  Additionally , after reviewing Dr.  Aljindi’s brief \nin response to the Government’s motion to dismiss, the court noted that Dr. Aljindi’s lawsuit was really focused on  \nhis allegations of “ judicial misconduct”  in the U.S. District \n \n1  Citations to “SAppx.” r efer to the Supplemental \nAppendix attached to the Government’s brief.  \n2  D r. Aljindi’s complaint does not mention patent in-\nfringement .  As for  a claim under federal copyright  law, \nDr. Aljindi’s complaint states that he seeks “$32.7 [m]illion \nfor [e]mployment [d]iscrimination [and  m]aximum mone-\ntary [c]onstitutional [r]elief for the intellectual property \nand copyright [] law[] violations, negligence, and tort.”   \nSAppx.  9.  There is no othe r mention of copyright law . Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 2     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 3 \nCourt for the Central District of California and the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.   SAppx. 2; see also  \nSAppx.  8 (requesting the court “take formal notice of the \nongoing judicial corruption, abuse, and torture in addition to [the Government’s] abuse and torture”).  The court thus \nconsidered those claims as well.  \nRegarding the first claim, employment discrimination, \nthe trial court explained that the Court of Federal Claims \ndoes not have jurisdiction over  federal employment dis-\ncrimination cases , i.e., it does not have the power to decide \nthose cases .  Rather, as the court explained, on ly federal \ndistrict courts  have jurisdiction  over those claims.  \nSAppx.  3 (quoting Taylor v. United States, 310 F.  App’x \n390, 393 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (“Because Title VII vests jurisdic-tion over discrimination claims exclusively in the district \ncourt, the Cour t of Federal Claims cannot exercise jurisdic-\ntion over those claims.”)).  \nThe trial court explained that Dr. Aljindi’s  second and \nthird claims —intellectual property theft  (not including \nclaims of patent infringement or copyright infringement) and negligence  and tort,  respectively —are tort claims, a \ntype of claim over which the court also lacks jurisdiction .  \nSAppx.  2–3 (citing 28  U.S.C. §  1491(a)(1) (“The United \nStates Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to \nrender judgment upon any claim against the United States \n. . . for .  . . damages in cases not sounding in tort .” (empha-\nsis added))).  The court also construed Dr. Aljindi’s intellec-\ntual property theft claim as a Fifth Amendment takings \nclaim but determined that Dr. Aljindi had not provided suf-ficient facts in his complaint to support such a claim .  Spe-\ncifically, the court determined that Dr. Aljindi  failed to \nspecify in his complaint “what the property consisted of, how it was taken, and what the [G]overnment did with it.”  SAppx.  3.   \nFinally, regarding Dr. Aljindi’s judicial misconduct al-\nlegations, the court explained that it “lacks authority to Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 3     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 4 \nreview allegations of misconduct by judges on another \ncourt.”  SAppx.  2 (citing 28 U.S.C. §§ 351, 363).  It also con-\nsidered Dr.  Aljindi’s alle gations that he had been denied \nrelief in the Central District of California and Ninth Cir-cuit.  Citing our prior decision holding that the Court of \nFederal Claims “does not have jurisdiction to review the decisions of district courts .  . . relating to proceedings be-\nfore those courts,” Joshua v.  United States , 17 F.3d 378, \n380 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the court explained that it likewise does not “have the power [i.e., jurisdiction] to review deci-\nsions” of either of these courts.  SAppx.  2.  And, in consid-\nering Dr. Aljindi’s allegations that the judicial misconduct \ninvolved criminal conduct or torts, the court explained that it lacks “jurisdiction over criminal matters,” SAppx. 2 –3 \n(quoting Jones v.  United States, 440 F. App’x 916, 918 (Fed. \nCir. 2011)), as well as  claims sounding in tort.   \nDr. Aljindi appeals.  We have jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. §  1295(a)(3).   \nD\nISCUSSION  \nOn appeal, Dr. Aljindi continues to seek $32.7 million \nfor employment discrimination, as well as  constitutional  \nrelief for the alleged intellectual property and copyright law violations, negligence, and tort.  A ppellant’s Br.  3.\n3  \nThe Court of Federal Claims dismissed these for lack of ju-\nrisdiction  or, in the alternative, for failure to state a claim .  \nWe review the Court of Federal Claims’ dis missal for lack \nof jurisdiction  de novo, i.e., without deference to the trial \ncourt .  Creative Mgmt. Servs., LLC v. United States, \n989 F.3d 955, 961 (Fed. Cir. 2021).   We also review dismis-\nsal for failure to state a claim de novo.  Id.  And while w e \nconstrue pro se filings like Dr. Aljindi’s  liberally, that does \n \n3  Because Dr. Aljindi’s opening brief on appeal in-\ncludes numerous attachments, we use the pagination pro-\nvided in the header of his brief.   Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 4     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 5 \nnot alleviate Dr. Aljindi’s  burden to establish jurisdiction.  \nHenke v.  United States , 60 F.3d 795, 799 (Fed. Cir. 1995) .   \nAs the trial court correctly explained, its jurisdiction “is \nlimited to specific types of claims against the federal gov-\nernment, most commonly claims for money as provided by \nthe Tucker Act.”  SAppx. 1 (citing 28 U.S.C. §  1491(a)(1)).  \nSpecifically, the Tu cker Act provides the Court of Federal \nClaims with “ jurisdiction to render judgment upon any \nclaim against the United States founded either upon the \nConstitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or i mplied \ncontract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort. ”  \n§ 1491(a)(1).   \nHere, the Court of Federal Claims properly determined \nthat it lacks jurisdiction over Dr. Aljindi’s employment dis-crimination , tort (including negligence and intellectual \nproperty theft), and judicial misconduct claims .  Regarding \nhis employment discrimination  claim , we have previously \nexplained that only the district courts —which do not in-\nclude the Court of Federal Claims —have jurisdiction over \nemployment discrimination claims.  See Taylor, 310 F. App’x at 393 (“Title  VII vests jurisdiction over dis-\ncrimination claims exclusively in the district court, [and] \nthe Court of Federal Claims cannot exercise jurisdiction \nover those clai ms.”).   We therefore affirm the trial court’s \ndetermination that it lacks jurisdiction to review Dr. Aljindi’s employment discrimination claim.  \nRegarding Dr. Aljindi’s tort claims , including his negli-\ngence and intellectual property theft  claims , the Tucke r \nAct specifically states that the Court of Federal Claims \nonly has jurisdiction over claims against the United States \nin cases “ not sounding in tort .”  § 14 91(a)(1); see Brown \nv. United States, 105 F.3d 621, 623 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“ The \nCourt of Federal Cla ims is a court of limited jurisdiction.  \nIt lacks jurisdiction over tort actions against the United Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 5     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 6 \nStates. ”).  As with employment discrimination claim s, only \nthe district courts have jurisdiction over tort claims against \nthe United States.  See Awad v.  United States, 301 F.3d \n1367, 1372 (Fed.  Cir. 2002) (explaining that the “ district \ncourts have jurisdiction in suits against the United States for” tort claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act); see also  \n28 U.S.C. §  1346(b)(1).   We therefore affirm the tr ial court’s \ndetermination that it lacks jurisdiction to review Dr. Aljindi’s tort claims, including negligence and intellec-\ntual property theft.  \nIn its motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the \nGovernment explained that Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint could \nbe liberally construed as alleging “either a takings claim; a claim of patent or copyright infringement; or a trade se-\ncrets claim” over which  the Court of Federal Claims would \nhave jurisdiction.  Appellant’s Br. 40 (reproducing Govern-\nment’s motion to dismiss at the Court of Federal Claims).  \nThe Government argued that Dr. Aljindi’s complaint did \nnot provide the minimum required factual allegati ons in \nhis complaint to support these claims.   \nThe trial court  agreed regarding Dr.  Aljindi’s Fifth \nAmendment takings claim, determining that he did not  \nprovide the minimum required factual allegations in his \ncomplaint to support  this claim.   See SAppx. 8 .  Dr. Aljindi \nargues on appeal, as he did in his complaint, that the De-\npartment of Defense “has stolen illegally and without giv-ing him credit” his intellectual property related to \ninformation security, artificial intelligence, and legacy in-\nformation syst ems, thus “invok[ing] the Fifth Amend-\nment .”  Appellant’s Br.  9.  While we must accept all “non-\nconclusory allegations of fact” in Dr.  Aljindi’s complaint as \ntrue, Samish Indian Nation v.  United States, 419 F.3d \n1355, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2005), here, Dr.  Aljind i’s one-sen-\ntence factual allegation regarding his  intellectual property \ntheft  is too conclusory to support a Fifth Amendment tak-\nings claim .  We agree with the trial court that Dr.  Aljindi’s \n“allegations are not facially plausible without factual Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 6     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 7 \nallegation s about what the property consisted of, how it \nwas taken, and what the government did with it.”  \nSAppx.  3.4 \nWe note, however, that Dr. Aljindi mentioned “copy-\nrights law[] violations” in the relief section of his complaint.  \nSAppx.  9.  As the Government stated in its trial brief, and \nwe agree, this can be liberally construed as a copyright in-\nfringement claim over which the Court of Federal Claims \nwould have jurisdiction.  See 28 U.S.C. §  1498(b) (“[W]hen-\never the copyright in any work protected under the copy-\nright laws of the United States shall be infringed by the \nUnited States, .  . . the exclusive action which may be \nbrought for such infringement shall be an action by the cop-\nyright owner against the United States in the Court of Fed-\neral Claims[.]”).  Because the trial court has jurisdiction \nover this claim, we vacate -in-part the court’s dismissal.  We \nremand for the court to consider the Government’s position \nthat Dr.  Aljin di’s complaint fails to state a claim for copy-\nright infringement, that is, that he has failed to identify \nsufficient facts in his complaint supporting this claim.   \nNext, we consider Dr. Aljindi’s claims of judicial mis-\nconduct, which the Court of Federal C laims dismissed for \nlack of jurisdiction.  As the trial court correctly explained, it does not have the authority to review allegations of mis-\nconduct by judges from  a different  court  (e.g., the Central \n \n4  We note that even if Dr. Aljindi’s complaint alleged \nadditional facts, the Court of Federal Claims would lack ju-risdiction to decide  his Fifth Amendment takings claim \nbased on his continued  assertion that the Government stole \nhis intellectual property “without his permission.”  Appel-lant’s Br. 9 .  As we explained in Shelden v. United States , \nthe Court of Federal Claims “ lacks jurisdiction over takings \nclaims in which the petitioner asserts the subject taking was not authorized. ”  742 F. App’x 496, 50 1 (Fed.  Cir. \n2018).  Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 7     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 8 \nDistrict of California) or a different circuit  (e.g., the Ninth \nCircuit) .  SAppx . 2; see also  Rules  for Judicial -Conduct and \nJudicial -Disability Proceedings 7(a)(1)5 (“Where to Initiate \nComplaint”: “a complaint against a judge of a United States \ncourt of appeals, a United States district court, a United \nStates bankruptcy court, or a United States magistrate \njudge must be filed with the circuit clerk in the jurisdiction in which the subject judge holds office”).  \nFinally, in his brief on appeal, Dr. Aljindi also alleges \nthat “his unique case involves” retaliati on.  Appellant’s \nBr. 4.  H e provides numerous allegations concerning retal-\niation by various federal agencies (as well as the Govern-ment’s attorneys) in his reply brief .  See, e.g., Appellant’s \nReply Br.  6–10.  Dr. Aljindi did not identify retaliation as \none of his causes of action in his complaint.  “[E]ven with the leniency afforded to pro se litigants, issues not raised before the [Court of Federal Claims] are waived on appeal.”  \nMone v.  United States , 766 F. App’x 979, 986 (Fed.  Cir. \n2019).  Dr. Aljindi’s claims of retaliation are therefore \nwaived because he failed to raise them at the trial court .   \nC\nONCLUSION  \nFor these reasons, we affirm -in-part and vacate -in-part \nthe decision of the Court of Federal Claims.6  On remand, \n \n5  https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/judi-\ncial_con duct_and_disability_rules_effective_march_12_2 \n019.pdf . \n6  On January 10, 2022, Dr. Aljindi filed a motion to \nexpedite his appeal.  ECF No. 14.  We denied that motion \non February 1, 2022, informing Dr. Aljindi that he “may \nself-expedite his appeal by filin g his reply brief early,” ECF \nNo. 16.  Dr. Aljindi filed a second motion to expedite his \nappeal on Mach 21, 2022.  ECF No. 23.  We deny this sec-ond motion to expedite as moot  because this opinion and Case: 22-1117      Document: 25     Page: 8     Filed: 05/10/2022ALJINDI  v. US 9 \nthe court should consider whether Dr. Aljindi’s complaint \ncontains the minimum required factual allegations to sup-\nport a claim of copyright infringement.  \nAFFIRMED -IN-PART, VACATED -IN-PART, AND \nREMANDED  \nCOSTS  \nNo costs.  \n \naccompanying judgment resolve the merits of Dr. Aljindi’s appeal .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The United States District Court for the Northern District of California transferred the case of John R. Fouts, a resident of Kentucky, and his minor child, to the Western District of Kentucky. The case involved numerous claims related to alleged failures by Kentucky and federal agencies impacting Fouts, such as not receiving social security checks and prescription drugs, and being subjected to a Child Protective Services investigation. Notably, Fouts included a “Notification of Use of Artificial Intelligence in Document Drafting” as part of his filings, but the court did not address these due to the decision to transfer the case based on improper venue.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue was whether the Northern District of California was the appropriate venue for the case.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the Northern District of California was not the proper venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as neither the parties involved nor the events related to the claims had any connection to this district. Consequently, the court ordered the transfer of the case to the Western District of Kentucky, which is a more appropriate venue given that the parties reside there and the events in question occurred there.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a big problem and want to talk to someone about it, but you accidentally go to the wrong office where people can't help you because your problem has nothing to do with them. This court decided that was the case here. John Fouts brought his problems to a court in California, but they all happened in Kentucky. So, the court said, \"Hey, this isn't the right place to talk about your problem. Let's send it to the Kentucky office where it belongs, so they can really help you out.\" They noticed he used some cool writing computer stuff (AI) to help file his paperwork, but since they aren’t handling his case, they didn’t get into the details of it.",

Nos. 1 , 4 \n \n \n \nBefore the Court are pro se  Plaintiff John R. Fouts  and his minor child ’s complaint , motion \nfor preliminary injunction, permanent restraining order, and permanent protective order  \n(“Motion”) , and several other filings and requests .1  ECF 1, 4.  Fouts  and his child are residents of \nKentucky who suffer from multiple medical conditions.  ECF 4  at 3.  Fouts alleges dozens of \nstatutory and constitutional violations against myriad Kentucky and federal agencies apparently \narising from, among other things, alleged failure to receive social security checks and prescription \ndrugs by mail, exposure to mold and other hazardous conditions in Fouts’s dwelling and \nsubsequent inability to obtain adequate medical care, as well as being subje ct to an improper Child \nProtective Services investigation, all in Kentucky.  See id.  at 8-35.  Having read Fouts’s papers \nand carefully considered the arguments therein, as well as the relevant legal authority, the Court \nhereby TRANSFERS  this action to the Western District of Kentucky pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1406, or alternatively, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a),  for the following reasons.   \n \n1 Since initiating this lawsuit, Fouts has filed a series of additional documents, including a \n“Motion to Compel Compliance with ADA Accommodations,” ECF 14, “Ophthalmological \nRecords Highlighting Critical Unmet Medical Needs,” ECF 16,  “HUD Correspondence \nHighlighting Systemic Failures, Discrimination, ADA Violations, and Neglect,” ECF 17 , and \n“Notification of Use of Artificial Intelligence in Document Drafting,” ECF 19, among others .  \nBecause the Court finds it appropriate to transfer the case, it does not address these filings.   Case 3:24-cv-09325-AMO     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 1 of 4 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  On December 23, 2024, the Court issued an order to show cause why the complaint should \nnot be dismissed or transferred for improper venue, as no party or event described in Fouts’s \npapers had any apparent connection to the Northern District of California.  ECF 12.  Venue is \nproper in a judicial district in which (1) any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the \nstate in which the district is located; (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred, or a su bstantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or \n(3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, \nany judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court’s persona l jurisdiction with \nrespect to such action.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b).  Similarly, w here a defendant is an agency of the \nUnited States, venue is proper “in any judicial district in which (A) a defendant in the action \nresides, (B) a substantial part of the event s or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a \nsubstantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or (C) the plaintiff resides if \nno real property is involved in the action. ”  28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).   \nA district court, in its discretion, “shall dismiss , or if it be in the interest of justice, \ntransfer ” an action under 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a) if venue is improper.  See King v. Russell , 963 F.2d \n1301, 1304 (9th Cir. 1992).  Courts may sua sponte  raise improper venue if, as here, the defendant \nhas not filed a responsive pleading and the parties are provided with an opportunity to respond to \nthe issue.  Costlow v. Weeks , 790 F.2d 1486, 1488 (9th Cir. 1986).  Even where venue is proper \nunder § 1391, a district court may transfer the case to another district for the convenience of the \nparties and witnesses.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) (“For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in \nthe interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division \nwhere it might have been brought.”).  The purpose of such transfer  is to “prevent the waste of \n‘time, energy and money’ and to ‘protect litigants, witnesses, and the public against unnecessary \ninconvenience and expense.’ ”  Van Dusen v. Barrack , 376 U.S. 612 (1964).  Courts may  also \ntransfer cases under § 1404(a) sua sponte . \n// \n// \n// Case 3:24-cv-09325-AMO     Document 41     Filed 01/15/25     Page 2 of 4 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Venue is not proper in this District.  Fouts and his child reside in Louisville,  Kentucky, as \ndo many  Defendants.2  Moreover, as far as the Court can discern from Fouts’s submissions , all \nrelevant events and omissions occurred in Kentucky.   See, e.g. , ECF 4 at 14 ( stating  that Fouts  and \nhis child suffered significant harm due to hazardous living conditions at an apartment with a \nLouisville, Kentucky address); id. at 22 -25 (describing  inadequate care by medical care providers \nat Baptist Health Louisville and University of Louisville).   In his response to the Court’s Order , \nFouts  does not assert that any Plaintiff or Kentucky agency  or individual establishes proper venue \nin this District , nor does he state that  any events or omissions occurred in this District.

Plaintiffs and many Defendants reside in Louisville, \nKentucky , which is also where the relevant events occurred.  Because no party resides in this \nDistrict, and because the events giving rise to Fouts’s claims did not occur here, t he Court thus \ndetermines that under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, venue is not  proper .   \nThe Court must next determine i f it would be in the interest of justice to transfer the case .  \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).   “[T]ransfer will generally be in the interest of justice .”  Amity \nRubberized Pen Co. v.

The Court concludes \nfrom its limited inquiry that transfer is in the interest of justice so that  Fouts ’s case  may be \nscreened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915 .

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In Mansfield and Marchionnda v. Norfolk Southern Railway Company, the plaintiffs sued under the Federal Employers' Liability Act to seek compensation for injuries from a train derailment caused by a rockslide. The court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, indicating sufficient evidence for a jury to determine whether the railway company was negligent in maintaining a safe working environment. AI was involved in the case as the railway had attempted to use an AI-based system to detect rockslides, but the system failed to be fully operational, contributing to the plaintiffs' claims of negligence.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Norfolk Southern Railway Company was negligent in ensuring a safe workplace by failing to prevent rockslides on its tracks, particularly through the inadequate implementation and operation of an AI-based rockslide detection system.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment, thereby allowing the case to proceed to trial. The court found that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to reasonably conclude that the rockslide was foreseeable and that the company may have been negligent in maintaining safety protocols, including the reliance on a faulty AI detection system.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine driving a car and suddenly hitting a fallen rock that caused you injuries. You believe the company responsible for maintaining the road should have warned you or removed the rocks before you got there. The company had a robot supposedly watching for dangerous rocks, but it wasn’t working that day. A judge decided that a group of citizens (a jury) should decide whether the company was careless, mainly because the faulty robot might have helped prevent accidents if it had worked.",

Defendant is a railroad company engaged in interstate commerce.  On \nDecember 12, 2021,  plaintiffs were employed by defendant as a locomotive engineer and \nconductor and were acting within the course and scope of  their employment while operating a \nwestbound train on defendant's \"Mon Line Track 2. \"  At approximately 4:00 a.m, their train \nstruck a  pile of debris at milepost 9.3 due to a  rockslide  from the adjacent hillside .  At that \nlocation the tracks abut a steep hillside that trans cends upward at a significant vertical ly-\nslanted  incline.  The hillside had significant layers of stone within its composition.  There are \nlarge sections of \"cut\" stone in the outer -most face of the hillside, which is referred to as \"cut \nrock\" by railroad personnel.  This characteristic of the terrain generally extend s from milepost \n9 to milepost 10 , with large sections of cut rock existing at various locations within that one -\nmile stretch .   \nThe specific area where the derailment occurred is known as \"CP Beck .\"  In the \ndirection plaintiffs were traveling t he tracks cross a highway and make a bend  while doing so .  \nSight ahead is part ially limited while traversing through this area, and a signal system is \nstationed to assist with safe passage into and through the corridor .  When plaintiffs traversed \ninto this area the signal was clear.  As they proceeded through and out of the bend, th e light \nfrom their locomotive suddenly illuminated a large obstruction in the center of the tracks.  Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 3 of 254 \n Plaintiffs had only a few seconds to react once they realized the magnitude of the obstruction \nand they moved to the center of the engine to brace for the  upcoming impact.           \nThe rocks on the tracks caused the locomotive in which plaintiffs were working to flip \nover and several cars to derail.  Conductor -plaintiff  Edward Mansfield (\"Mansfield\") was \ndiagnosed with a concussion, post -concussion syndrome and anxiety following the accident \nand was out of work from December 12, 2021 , through December 29, 2022.  Engineer -plaintiff \nMatthew Marchionda was diagnosed with a concussion, post -concussion syndrome and \nforaminal stenosis of the cervical spine followin g the accident and was out of work from \nDecember 12, 2021 , through December, 2023.   Pretrial Stipulation (Doc. No. 40) at ¶ ¶ III (a) -\n(h). \nPrior to the derailment, several rockslides had occurred between milepost s 9.0 and 9.9.  \nA rockslide occurred in the a rea on January 11, 2013.  Engineer Leis was driving the train \nwhen it collided with debris on the tracks.  She completed a repor t stating:  \"while operating \n653 North on track 1 at Monline  9.2 [the locomotive] struck 2 large rocks fouling track 1.\"  \nReport of Personal Injury of Cathy M. Leis (Doc. No. 43 -7) at 4.  She provided this description \nin two separate report s of personal injury that were completed within a few hours of the \nincident.   Id. p. 6.  Leis' supervisor completed a report that also identified the location of the \nincident as occurring at milepost 9.2.  Id. at pp. 4 -5.     \nDefendant dispatched a team to inspect the scene and clean up the debris.  A crew \ndispatched  by Engineer G eotechnical Services took photographs of the debris and completed a \nreport of inspection.  It identified the accident as occurring at mile post 9.9.  Report of \nEngineer Geotechnical Services (Doc. No. 43 -6) at pp. 18 -20.    Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 4 of 255 \n Defendant hired Golder and Assoc iates (\"Golder\") to conduct an investigation into the \nrockslide, undertake a site visit and observations , and make recommendations regarding the \nrockslide.  It performed these undertakings on January 15, 2013, and issued a report on January \n17, 2013.    \nIn its report, Golder identified the rockslide as occurring at milepost 9.9.  It observed \nand identified the various form ations of rock that could be identified visually from track level \nin the steep slope near the location of the slide .  It determined that t he slide occurred near the \ncrest of the rock slope, which was \"80 to 100 feet vertically above the track grade.\"  Golder \nAssociates Report of January 17, 2013 (Doc. No. 43 -6) a p. 2.  It opined that \"the slide \noccurred within the middle massive sandstone m ember (Morgantown) of the Casselman \nFormation.\"  Id.  This sandstone unit is about \"20 to 25 [f oot] thick in the slope and is \nunderlain by approximately 20 [foot] of thinly -bedded siltstone and shale.\"  Id.   Bent tre es \nwere observed to the south of the sl ide indicating \"soil/talus creep [was] occurring\" and several \nwet areas also were observed.  There was erosion occurring below the lower sandstone unit, \nindicating a potential for further slides.  There was evidence of similar erosion and failure \nwhere a p rior rockslide occurred \"within this same sandstone unit\" at mile post 9.8 .  Id. at p. 3.   \nGolder identified two factors that likely contributed to the slide: (1) the erosion and \nundercutting of the underlying weaker , thinly -bedded siltstones and shales; and (2) the freeze \nand thaw cycles expanding the soil behind the block and reducing cohesion on the joint plain \nthat gave way.  Id.  The \"mechanism\" was similar \"to the ML 4.9 rockslide mechanism that \noccurred in November [of]  2012. \"  Id.  Similar to the milepost 4.9 rockslide  that occurred \napproximately 10 years earlier , a large rock mass remained near the crest of the slope.  Golder Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 5 of 256 \n opined that \"this rock mass will eventually be undermined by the differential weathering and \nerosion of the siltstone/shale and fall from the slope.\"  Id.     \nGolder recommended removing the large rock mass at the crest of the slope.  It also \nrecommended  conducting frequent visual observations of the hillside (such as twice a week) \nfor factors that  might indicate hillside instability .  It indicated that the slides were more likely \nto occur with the event of inclement weather, such as heavy rains, sudden temperature changes , \nand freezing and thawing cycles .  Additional visual inspections were recomme nded follow ing \nsuch weather events.   Id. at p. 4 .  If changes to the slopes were detect ed, Golder recommended \nthat a \"slow order \" be issued \"in this area\" to decrease the chance of a train colliding with any \nslide that occurred.  In the alternative, Golder  recommended defendant \"install a rockfall \ndetection fence at this location tied into the signal system to provide an early warning of a \nrockfall.\"  Id.   \nA rockslide also occurred on February 12, 2017 , between mile posts 9.9 and 10.  Golder \nwas again disp atched to make field observations and recommendations.  Crews removed 15 \ndump truck loads of rock and debris from the tracks.  \nGolder reported that the 2017 slide was adjacent to the location where the 2013 slide \nhad occurred.  At the time of its observations there were two large blocks that remained near \nthe top of the slope but were observed to be moving.  They had dropped about  18 feet down the \nslope, bulldozing a soil pile as they did so and shedding smaller rock s and debris as they \nmoved.  In addition, Golder noted the adjacent scarp face of the 2013 rockslide appeared to \nhave minimal stability .  Golder cautioned that the larg e blocks were precariously positioned \nand the shale that was directly beneath them was mostly gone except for what was directly at \ntheir base .  It noted that this was the same mechanism that caused the second failure at mile Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 6 of 257 \n post 4.5 after the first two bl ocks there came down, and it opined that the two large blocks that \nwere continuing to move were  likely  the next rockslide in the making .   \nGolder recommended that the two main blocks that were still moving be broken up on \nthe slope and scaled down in a con trolled manner; the scarp from the 2013 slide be scaled \ndown at that time or with in one year; the additional loose rocks on the right be assessed and \nscaled down if they were minimally stable; and the center nose of the rock beneath the two \nsliding blocks be assessed and scaled down if necessary; all with care to avoid over -scaling and \ndestabilization.  Golder and Associates Report of February 21, 2017 (Doc. No. 43 -8) at pp. 2 -4.  \nIn March of 2019, defendant solicited proposals for the creation of an artifi cial \nintelligence system designed to detect rockslide activity that threatened track integrity.  \nCommunications Concepts Integration (\"CCI\") presented a number of different options to \nreview the types of systems available and select an option that would mi nimize false positives.  \nIn July through September of 2019, defendant installed a support cantilever and camera system \nnear milepost 9.25 as part of a test program.  The purpose of the system was proactively to \ndetect and provide early notice of rockslides  and/or potential rockslide activity.   \nThe system encompassed thermal cameras, a laser measuring system and artificial \nintelligence technology to monitor the tracks , the cut rock and the adjacent s ections of the steep \nincline abutting the tracks.  It was intended to provide a better system than the previously \nemployed measures for monitoring rockslides and changes in the area that indicat ed a potential \nfor rockslide activity.  In order to work properly, the system had to be \"taught \" how to \ndistinguish between acceptable ground and other movements and unacceptable rockslides.  \nCCI had recommended that defendant set up slide fences while the system made its own \ndecisions during th at learning process.   Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 7 of 258 \n Challenges arose during the efforts to get the system operational.  The laser measuring \nsystem and the accompanying artificial intelligence proved to be unsuccessful for the location.  \nDuring the fall of 2020, the system continued to  malfunction and present unanticipated \nchallenges.  For example, t he system failed to alert to the events that it should have and \npresented challenges as to its reliability regarding  varying weather conditions.  Changes were \nmade to the components of the s ystem , including installing a new camera with infrared \nilluminators.  When this failed, it was proposed that the system be set up with LIDAR, which is \na form of penetrating radar.  The system never became fully functional and was non -\noperational on the day  plaintiffs encountered the rockslide underlying this lawsuit.  \nEach party retained an expert in preparation for trial.  Plaintiff retained George A. \nGavalla, a consultant and expert in railroad industry safety sta ndards and  practices, to offer \nopinions as to the safety issues relating to the underlying train derailment and the plaintiffs' \nresulting injuries.  Gavalla authored an expert report about the relation of standard safety \npractices to the incident .  He is prepared to opine that defendant knew or sho uld have known \nabout the history of rockslides in the area and should have taken additional steps  to ensure \nplaintiffs' safety , such as installing a slide fence  connected to its signal system or utilizing \nflagmen .  Report of George A. Gavalla ( Doc. No. 43-5) at pp. 20-21. \nDefendant retained Engineering Systems, Inc.  (\"ESI\") , a geotechnic and engineering \nfirm, to review the defendant's maintenance and inspection practices regarding the rockslide \nactivity at milepost 9.3 on December 12, 2021 .  The authors of the report are prepared to offer \nopinions about the differences between the causes for that rockslide and the others that \noccurred in the vicinity of milepost 9.9  as well as the safety practices defendant utilized in \nthose respective areas.  They also are prepared to opine that the rockslides were at distinct Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 8 of 259 \n locations that are unrelated  from a geotechnical standpoint.  In addition,  the 9.3 location was \ninactive prior to the 2021 incident, it did not pose any more risk tha n numerous other rock \nslopes in Western Pennsylvania, and defendant followed accepted as well as proactive safety \nprecautions at that location.  Report of Nathaniel Landsperger, P.E., and Dustin Bell (Doc. No. \n43-4) at p. 22.   \nPlaintiff s contend that the dangerous condition caused by the  presence of the \nrockslide/boulders on the tracks w as attributable to the negligence of defendant.  Complaint ¶ \n19.  They identify several means by which defendant's actions fell short of the standard of care, \nincluding failing to conduct proper inspection s, issue effective safety orders, provide effective \nwarnings and utiliz e appropriate safety equipment.  Id. at ¶¶ 24 (a) -(j).   \nMore specifically, plaintiffs posit that the negligence of the defendant consisted of  \nshortcomings in defendant's system of inspecting for rockslides and potential rockslide activity, \nincluding the failure to inspect the hillsides , cut rock and/ or the tracks at or near the site of the \naccident .  This should have been done  either pursuant t o a routine inspection or as part of a  \nweather -related inspection following the heavy rain and winds that occurred on December 11, \n2021 .  Further, defendants failed to follow a recommendation by CCI to utilize a slide fence \nwhile the artificial intelligenc e system was transitioned to full operational capacity .  Plaintiffs' \nBrief in Opposition (Doc. No. 45) at pp. 7 -9.   \nDefendant moves for summary judgment for three basic reasons.  First, it asserts it met \nits duty to inspect and maintain the tracks at mile post 9.3 under the existing circumstances and \nits efforts even exceed ed the requirements of the F ederal Railroad Administration ( \"FRA \").  \nDefendant's Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgement (Doc. No. 42) at p. 7.  Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 9 of 2510 \n Second, plaintiff's expert misint erpreted the underlying facts by resting his conclusions \non the proposition that there were prior rockslides at milepost 9.3 when all documentation save \none set of \"incorrectly completed \" form s indicates that the other slides occurred at or near \nmilepost 9.9.  Doing so supposedly renders his opinions inadmissible because they are bereft of \nactual factual support and reflect a gross misinterpretation of the record.  And without such \nfactual suppo rt, plaintiffs cannot s how defendant was aware of a risk of rockslides at the \naccident site as it relates to satisfy ing the forese eability requirement of their negligence claim.   \nThird, plaintiffs' expert lacks the qualifications to testify as to the fore seeability of \nrockslides at milepost 9.3.  Gavalla admittedly is not a geologist or a geotechnical expert.  Nor \nis he a civil engineer.  And he purportedly lacks the background to render a geotechnical \nanalysis.  So from defendant's perspective, he does no t have the scientific, technical or other \nspecialized knowledge required to provide a conclusion about the probability of rockslides \noccurring near milepost 9.3.   \nPursuant to these three grounds , defendant maintains that plaintiffs lack sufficient \nevidenc e to establish a material issue of fact as to the foreseeability of a rockslide at milepost \n9.3 on December 12, 2021 , and/or that defendant committed any negligence that contributed to \nplaintiffs' injuries .   \nPlaintiffs maintain that there is more than suf ficient evidence to show defendant was on \nnotice of the potential for rockslides in the area  and its own actions and records demonstrate as \nmuch.  Further, the caselaw is clear that such matters are reserved for the jury to resolve.  And \nthe jury may well conclude that defendant was negligent by failing to install a slide fence at the \nlocation in question and/or inspect the area after the severe weather on December 11, 2021.  \nAnd plaintiffs' expert has sufficient experience to opine about these matters.  See Plaintiffs' Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 10 of 2511 \n Counterstatement of Material Facts (Doc. No. 46) at ¶¶ 66 -84 (which plaintiffs incorporate into \ntheir brief in opposition).   \nDefendant's contention that Gavalla  lacks the requisite expertise to offer opinions about \ndefendant's undertakings and practices as they relate to the safety conditions of the track at \nmilepost 9.3 on December 12, 2023, is unavailing.  The issue of whether  Gavalla  will be \npermitted to testify generally is governed by a Daubert Inquiry.   The record as currently \ndeveloped supports the admissibility of his proposed testimony.    \nUnder Federal Rule of Evidence 702, trial courts must act as \"gatekeeper\" and exercise \ndiscretion to preclude expert testimony that is unreliable, irrelevant, or unhelpful to the jury.  \nDaubert , 509 U.S. at 597.  In the Third Circuit, district courts must focus on the \"trilogy of \nrestrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability and f it.\"  Calhoun v. Yamaha Motor \nCorp. , U.S.A., 350 F.3d 316 (3d Cir. 2003).  Thus, district courts should permit expert \ntestimony so long as: (1) the expert has the necessary qualifications, (2) the testimony is based \non reliable methods, and (3) the testimo ny would assist the trier of fact in understanding the \nevidence or in resolving factual issues.  See In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litigation , 35 F.3d 717, \n741–43 (3d Cir. 1994) (\" Paoli II \").1 \nDefendant claims that Gavalla  does not have the necessary qualific ations to testify as \nan expert on the incident at issue, namely because he is not a geologist , geotechnical expert  or \na civil engineer.   But this position misapprehends the nature of Gavalla's proposed testimony \n \n1 This opinion applies the current version of Rule 702, which was most recently amended on \nDecember 1, 2023. \"The amendment does not substantively alter Rule 702, but rather 'clarifies \nthat the preponderance standard applies to the three reliability -based re quirements added in \n2000 —requirements that many courts have incorrectly determined to be governed by the more \npermissive Rule 104(b) standard.'\" S.Y. v. Roman Cath. Diocese of Paterson , No. 20CV2605 \n(EP) (CLW), 2024 WL 1231333, at *2 (D.N.J. Mar. 21, 2024)  (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702 \nadvisory committee's note to 2023 amendments).   Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 11 of 2512 \n and the factual foundations in the record that support it.  Gavalla's testimony is focused on the \nsafety measures defendant did and did not undertake in the area in and around CP Beck where \nthe derailment occurred, what defendant knew or should have known from the plethora of \ninformation available to it, what defendant's actions reveal about its knowledge and \nunderstandings as they relate to safe rail passage in th at corridor and whether defendant's \nactions and inactions breached the standard of care.  And as to these matters, Gavalla ’s \nproposed testimony and opinion s meet the foundational requirements for admission under Rule \n702.   \nGavalla  possess es the requisite qualifications  to provide testimony as an expert in \nrailroad safety .  To qualify as an expert,  the witness must possess specialized expertise, gained \nfrom \"practical experience as well as academic training and credentials\" in the relevant area.  \nJones v. Swepi L.P. , 643 F. Supp. 3d 547, 561 (W.D. Pa. 2022) (quoting Waldorf v. Shuta , 142 \nF.3d 601, 6 25 (3d Cir. 1998)).  \nGavalla  has 47 years of experience in the railroad industry.   ECF Doc. No. 43 -5 at p. \n27.  Gavalla attended Georgetown University, earning a degree in history, graduated from a \nsenior executive service program at the Federal Executive Institute and completed an executive \ntraining course at Harvard University.  From 1976 to 1984, he worked as a communications \nand signal maintainer for Consolidated Rail Corporation.  He inspected, tested, repaired and \nbuilt railroad communications and signal systems throughout Conrail's territory, which \nconsisted of Washington D.C., Maryland, Virginia , Pennsylvania and Delaware.  Among other \nthings, h e was responsible for the installation and maintenance of rockslide detection systems, \nincluding slide fences , throughout this territory.  Id. at 2.  Plaintiffs are prepared to elicit \nfurther testimony abo ut Gavalla's experience in these matters.  Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 12 of 2513 \n After working for seven years as an assistant general chairman and four years as the \ndirector of research for the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen , in 1995  Gavalla joined the \nFRA as a safety project coordinator on the Amtrak , Long Island Railroad  and the Union Pacific \nRailroad .  ECF Doc. No. 43 -5 at p p. 3, 29.  There he conducted large scale assessments of \npassenger rail operations and safety.  In this role he had to become familiar with all regulations \nand railroa d rules, policies, and safety management practices .  Id. at p. 3.  Plaintiffs are \nprepared to elicit testimony from Gavalla to the effect that as part of his duties he researched \nrockslides and fault planes and the propensity of adjacent rock formations to  collapse once \nthere had been a prior rockslide.   It is apparent that Gavalla will be able to provide this \nbackground information.     \nIn October of 1997, Gavalla  became the Associate Administrator for Safety  with the \nFRA , wherein he was the senior manager  of the FRA’s Office of Safety .  He served in that \ncapacity until early 2004.   Id. at 29.  As the senior official in the Office of Safety, he had to \noversee the safety of our nation’s railroads  and the managing of FRA’s safety programs, \nincluding promulgating new and revised federal railroad safety regulations, overseeing the \nenforcement those regulations and conducting railroad accident investigations.   Id. at 3.   \nSince 2011, Gavalla  has run his own railroad safety consulting company, which utilizes \na network of railroad safety and operations experts.   Id.  His projects have included performin g \nsafety assessments of rail operations, conducting safety training , developing rules and \nprocedures regarding train operations, conducting track inspections and risk assessments,  and \nproviding hazard analys es of highway -rail grade crossing systems.  Id.   \nIt is undisputed that the use of slide fences in areas prone to rockslides have been very \ncommon for many decades and provide a widely accepted standard of care on all major Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 13 of 2514 \n railroads.  Id. at 9-10.  Indeed, defendant employed these fences at hundreds of locations \nthroughout its territory.  Spadone Deposition (Doc. No. 46 -3) at p. 7.  Gavalla is not a \ngeotechnical engineer.  Nevertheless, he does have a developed understanding of railroad \nindustry policies and procedures for managing and mitigating the ris ks of rockslides, falling \nrocks and landslides.  Gavalla Report (Doc. 45 -3) at p. 15.  \nIt is clear that Gavalla  has gained specialized expertise in railroad safety from his \neducation and extensive years of experience working in, with and overseeing safety r egulations \ninvolving railroads.   His exposure to, experience with and safety evaluation of the common \ncomponent s of railroad safety practices and procedures is readily apparent.  Gavalla has \nextensive experience in working with, reviewing and analyzing rai lroad safety practices, which \nnecessarily include s the common use of slide fences.  Thus, t here appears to be little doubt that \nGavalla has the requisite experience to testify about the common uses of slide fences  and the \nsafety regulations and circumstanc es surrounding their use.   \nIt likewise follows that Gavalla has the requisite experience to testify about the general \nand/or specific circumstances surrounding the use of slide fences as they relate to maintaining \nsafe practices on the railroad.  As Spado ne confirmed, the use of slide fences is a common \nsafety measure employed by railroads and defendant utilizes them at hundreds of locations on \nits tracks.  And defendant has to monitor and make decisions about the need for utilizing these \nand other measures to combat the threat of rockslides at these various locations with its \nordinary workforce, which does not include geological, geotechnical or civil engineering \nexperts.  It follows that Gavalla's familiarity with the circumstances connected to the  use of \nsuch a common component of safety on the railroad can readily be assumed.   Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 14 of 2515 \n For the same reasons, Gavalla has the experience to offer testimony and conclusions \nabout defendant's use of the prototype artificial intelligence system employed by defend ant at \nCP Beck as well as the safety regulations and concerns surrounding th at undertaking.  His \nexperience provides a sufficient basis to assess the safety regulations and accept ed safety \npractices implicated by that undertaking, and whether defendant satisfied the applicable \nstandards of care while attempting to get that system to full functionality.   \nIn short , Gavalla  is qualified under Rule 702 to render opinions on the adequacy of \nsafety measures put in place and/or omitted by defendant  in conjunction  with the general area \nand/or the specific location where the underlying derailment occurred .   \nNext, Gavalla ’s testimony is reliable.  The reliability inquiry is a flexible one wherein \nthe court must focus solely on the expert's chosen principles and meth odology rather than the \nconclusions drawn therefrom.  Daubert , 509 U.S. at 594 –95.  \"To be reliable, the expert's \nopinion must be premised on more than mere subjective belief or unsupported speculation; the \nexpert must have good grounds for his or her beli ef.\"  Marcum v. Columbia Gas Transmission, \nLLC , 549 F. Supp. 3d 408, 416 (E.D. Pa. 2021) (quoting Paoli II , 35 F.3d at 742) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).   \nWhether \"good grounds\" support an expert's potential testimony depends on various \nfactors, incl uding: \"(1) whether a method consists of a testable hypothesis; (2) whether the \nmethod has been subject to peer review; (3) the known or potential rate of error; (4) the \nexistence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique's operation; (5) whet her the \nmethod is generally accepted; (6) the relationship of the technique to methods which have been \nestablished to be reliable; (7) the qualifications of the expert witness testifying based on the \nmethodology; and (8) the non -judicial uses to which the method has been put.\"  Jones , 643 F. Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 15 of 2516 \n Supp. 3d at 562 (quoting Pineda v. Ford Motor Co. , 520 F.3d 237, 247 –48 (3d Cir. 2008)).  \nBut these factors are not exhaustive and some may be more or less applicable depending on the \ncase.   See Pineda , 520 F.3d at 248.   Trial courts have broad latitude in determining whether \nthese specific factors are \"reasonable measures of reliability in a particular case.\"  Kumho Tire \nCo. v. Carmichael , 526 U.S. 137, 153, 119 S. Ct. 1167, 1176, 143 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1999).  \nGavalla ’s opini ons and testimony  are based on his years of experience working with, \noverseeing and evaluating railroad safety measures in a variety of settings .  He also \n\"review [ed] relevant materials; review [ed] safety rules, procedures and standards; examine [ed] \nreleva nt documents, [and] review [ed] testimony and evidence obtained through discovery \nrelative to th [is] case.\"  ECF Doc. No. 43 -5 at p. 2 .  Thus , he used his practical experience to \nassess the safety standards that were employed or not employed by defendant.  And he drew on \naccepted industry standards in formulating his opinion.  Accordingly, Gavalla 's proposed \ntestimony and opinion s sufficiently are premised on his knowledge, experience, and facts in the \nrecord to satisfy the reliability prong.   \nFinally, Gavalla ’s testimony \"fits\" because there are good grounds to believe it would \nhelp a jury decide a factual dispute.  To determine whether an expert's testimony \"fits\" the \nproceedings, the trial court asks \"whether [the] expert testimony proffered . . . is sufficiently \ntied to the f acts of the case that it will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute.\"  United States \nv. Schiff , 602 F.3d 152, 173 (3d Cir. 2010) (quoting Daubert , 509 U.S. at 591). This \nrequirement goes primarily to relevance.  See Daubert , 509 U.S. at 591.  Even if  an expert's \ntestimony is based on their specialized knowledge, \"the testimony will be excluded if it is not \nknowledge related to the purposes of, or pertinent inquiry to, the case.\"   Jones , 643 F. Supp. 3d \nat 563.   Gavalla ’s testimony meets this requireme nt: it directly addresses a number of the Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 16 of 2517 \n fundamental factual disputes in this litigation, including whether defendant met its duty of care \nwith regard to the s afety protocols that were utilized or omitted .  \nHaving established that Gavalla  is a qualified e xpert, his opinions are sufficiently \nreliable, and there are good grounds to believe that the testimony will be helpful to the jury, \nplaintiffs have met the foundational requirements for admission under Rule 702.  Therefore , \nthe court will assume for the p urposes of resolving defendant's summary judgment that the \nexpert testimony proffered by plaintiff  relating to the applicable standards of care and whether \ndefendant breached those standards is admissible .2 \nDefendant 's contention that plaintiffs' ability to prove the potential of a rockslide at CP \nBeck was foreseeable to defendant requires the testimony of a geologist , geotechnical expert  or \na civil engineer  is misplaced.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that G avalla relied on \nan assumption of fact that the major derailments in 2013 and 2017 were at the same location  as \nthe underlying derailment and this assumption was erroneous , the record contains more than \nsufficient evidence from which the finder of fact can  determine that the potential for rockslides \nin the vicinity of milepost 9.3 was foreseeable to defendant prior to the December 12, 202 1, \nincident.   \nUnder the FELA “[e]very common carrier by railroad ... shall be liable in damages to \nany person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier ... for such injury or death \nresulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of \nsuch carrier....” 45 U.S.C. § 51.  The FELA is a negligence statute with a  relaxed st andard of \ncausation.  Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall , 512 U.S. 532, 542 –543 (1994).    \n \n2 This ruling will be without prejudice to either party filing additional motions in limine , \nincluding a Daubert motion provided there are reasonable grounds for doing so.     Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 17 of 2521 \n can be used to satisfy it.  Hines , 926 F.2d at 268 (citing Gallick , 372 U.S. at 117 and collecting \ncases).  And in this jurisdiction, \"[a] trial court is justified in withdrawing  . . . issue[s] from the \njury's consideration only in those extremely rare instances where there is a zero probability \neither of employer neglig ence or that any such negligence contributed to the injury of an \nemployee.”  Pehowic , 430 F.2d at 699 –700; Monheim , 996 F. Supp.2d at 362 (citing Eckert v. \nAliquippa & S. R.R. , 828 F.2d 183, 187 (3d Cir.  1987) (applying Pehowic 's zero probability \ntest) and Masters v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., Inc. , No. 08 –1872, 2010 WL 4973315, at *8 (Oct. 6, \n2010) (same) ). \n\"The ultimate question is whether a reasonable jury could reach the conclusion that the \nemployer was negligent in whole or in part \" and an \" FELA plaintiff mus t present probative \nfacts from which the negligence and causal relationship can reasonably be inferred in order to \nsurvive summary judgment. \"   Monheim , 996 F. Supp.2d at 362 (citing Rogers, 352 U.S. at \n508 and Dessi v. Pa. R.R. Co. , 251 F.2d 149, 151 (3d Cir. 1958) ).  However , even with these \nlesser standards of proof for negligence and causation , a plaintiff  cannot survive summary \njudgment based on pure speculation or a record completely devoid of probative facts.   Id. \n(citing Newton v. Norfolk S. Corp. , No. 05 –1465, 2008 WL 55997, *8 (W.D.  Pa. Jan. 3, \n2008) ). \nHere, se veral aspects of the record  can be used to satisfy th e foreseeability requirement.   \nFirst,  Mansfield is prepared to recount a long history of rockslides in the vicinity of CP Beck , \nwhich was well -known  to those who regularly worked in the area.   Mansfield indicated the \narea had been prone to slides since the time he began working for defendant (which was over a \ndecade) and there had been multiple slides on just about the whole Mon L ine.  One involved \nTeddy Karas at about the same location.  Marchionda testified that this one occurred around Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 21 of 2522 \n the time he was hired.  The 2013 slide with Cathy Leis was reported by her and her supervisor \nas occurring near the location in question and even ass uming it occurred close to or near \nmilepost 9.9, it did occur on Mon Line within a half a mile from the location in question.  The \n2017 slide was adjacent to the site of the 2013  slide.  Mansfield recalled another slide \ninvolving Sam Wagner occurring near milepost 9 in 2018.  And Marchionda recounted another \nslide on the Mon Line near Mt. Washington after the one involving Wagner.  While defendant \nmay choose to defend on the ground that each of these incidents involved locations that where \ndistinct  from a g eotechnical perspective , it appears that the testimony at trial will support an \ninference that the Mon Line in general and the area known as CP Beck in particular was a \nhotbed for slide activity.  \nSecond, the jury may make a comparison between the face of the sheared rock \nformation and ascending incline abutting the tracks at milepost 9.3 and those same \ncharacteristics  at milepost 9.9.  In doing so, they may draw on any understandings that should \nhave been known by defendant 's workforce and observation crews in assessing the similarities \nand differences in the safety risk that these two locations presented.  Defendant had to use its \nregular work force to monitor slide prone areas and to make decisions about the risks they \npresented  on a day -to-day basis .  Although defendant had outside geotechnical  experts \navailable for consultation, its workforce and observation crews were not geotechnical experts.  \nThey were , however , trained on a general level to look for geometr ic or FRA d efects and were \ndirected to inspect visually the slopes, cut sections and rock faces  abutting the tracks as part of \ntheir required inspections.  So, there were ongoing efforts and decisions made by defendant's \nworkforce about the se aspects of the  terrain a nd the weather conditions that presented at any Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 22 of 2523 \n given time .  And safety decisions were regularly made  based in part on what was observed \nabout the conditions of the tracks and the inclines and hillsides that abut them.   \nAgainst this backdrop , the pictures  of 1) the derailment, 2) the Prototype AI Camera \nSlide Detector and 3) the comparisons of the cut rock walls at mileposts 9.2 and 9.9 provide \ninsight into what defendant's inspection crews and management personnel would have s een and \nunderstood in fulf illing defendant's duties to provide a safe workplace at each of those \nlocations.   In this regard , defendant's photographs depicting the cut rock and steep inclines \nexisting where the derailment in question occurred and at mile post 9.9 bear substantial \nsimilarities.  While being  presented as  photographs of different locations, the size and vertical \nascent of the cut rock formations abutting the tracks share many of the same characteristics.  \nThus, while defendant is free to argue that the two locations presented very different risks for \nrockslide activity from a geological and geotechnical point of view, the very na ture of the \ninclines, the cut rock protruding from the face of the vertical incline s, the distinct formation of \nthe layers of stone , debris at the base of the incline abutting the tracks near milepost 9.3  and the \ncatch basin at that location  provide some e vidence from which the finder of fact may inform its \nassessment of whether defendant was on notice of a potential for rockslides at the CP Beck \nderailment site.   \nThird, and tellingly, defendant chose to locate the Prototype AI Camera Slide Detector \nin clo se proximity to where the derailment occurred.   Defendant installed this system as a \nproactive measure to provide early detection of potential rockslides.  The system was installed \nwithin 600 feet of where the derailment occurred.  Again, assuming there ha d not been any \nsignificant slides at that precise location at the time of installation, there had been a number of \nother slides near that location and significant slides within a half mile of it as noted above.  The Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 23 of 2524 \n plan was to prevent future rockslides and the idea was for the camera system to capture a \npotential rockslide in real  time while identifying other obstructions that would not pose the \nsafety risks of a rockslide and then distinguish between the two.  It wa s planned that the system \nwould be integrated so that train crews would receive notice of a potential obstruction through \neither radio dispatch or a stop signal within the existing signal system.  \nTo gain functionality, the AI system had to be taught to dif ferentiate between the events \nin the environment around it that were acceptable and those that were not.  In other words, \ndefendant had to select a location that had the potential to expose the system to rockslides that \nhad the potential to present a dange r to safe rail passage and those that were minor and did not \npose such a safety risk.  Defendant chose a location close to CP Beck  as being capable of \nproviding a terrain that presented the potential for these differing events in real time.  And the \njury m ay consider the siting of system near the derailment site as some evidence about whether \ndefendant knew or had reason to know that the near vertical incline abutting the tracks and face \nof the cut rock at the derailment site presented a foreseeable risk of  rockslides that threatened \nthe safety of train operations and railroad crews.  And they can consider the degree to which \nCCI's recommend ation that a slide fence be used while the system was brought up to full \nfunctional capacity  has a bearing on whether a  foreseeable risk of rockslides existed at or near \nCP Beck prior to the derailment  as well as whether defendant breached a duty by failing to use \nan alternative measure to provide a safe workplace at that location .          \nIt follows that these aspects of record provide sufficient direct and circumstantial \nevidence from which the jury can find that prior to the derailment defendant could foresee a \nrisk of harm to crew members at or near that site .  In other words, there is not zero probability \nof defendant being found to have been negligent and the issue of foreseeability is an issue of Case 2:22-cv-01159-DSC     Document 49     Filed 09/25/25     Page 24 of 2525 \n fact for the jury to decide notwithstanding the fact that plaintiffs do not intend to introduce \ntheir own geotechnical or civil engineering expert.  Consequently, this component of \ndefendant's motion for summary judgment cannot bear the weight defendant assigns to it.   \nIn short, there are numerous issue s of material fact for the jury to decide.  Among them \nare whether defendant knew or should have known that rocksl ides were likely to occur in the  \narea and whether a rockslide that would present a risk to crew safety at or near CP Beck was \nforeseeable to defendant prior to the derailment , whether the weather conditions were severe \nenough to cause the need for addition al inspection,  whether defendant's actions or inactions at \nthat location were consistent with its duties to provide a reasonably safe workplace , and so \nforth .  These are all issues which the jury must determine.   And plaintiff's safety expert and the \nrecor d as developed supply sufficient evidence from which the elements of plaintiffs' claims \ncan be satisfied.   \nFor the reasons  set forth above , defendant's motion for summary judgement will be  \ndenied.   An appropriate order will follow.   \nDate: September 2 5, 2025  \n s/David Stewart Cercone                        \n David Stewart Cercone  \n Senior United States District Judge  \n \n \ncc: Lawrence A.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** The case involves Plaintiff Medicare Advantage customers suing UnitedHealth Group and others, alleging that UHC unreasonably denied their post-acute care claims using an AI program called nH Predict. The court partially grants UHC's motion to dismiss, allowing the claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing to proceed, but dismisses most other claims due to federal preemption and failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** Whether Plaintiffs' claims, particularly relating to the denial of benefits using AI, must first be subjected to exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Medicare Act, and if those claims are preempted by federal law.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court waived the exhaustion requirement due to futility and irreparable harm but found most of the Plaintiffs' claims preempted by federal law. Only the breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims survive preemption.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** The people in this case are claiming that their health plan unfairly used a computer program instead of doctors to decide not to pay for their healthcare, making them suffer. Normally, they would have to go through a long process of asking for help before taking the issue to court, but the judge decided they didn't have to because it seemed like UHC was making it too hard by repeatedly denying claims. However, most of their claims can't be looked at by the court because there are federal rules that take priority over state rules when it comes to Medicare health plans. So, only a couple of their complaints can keep going—they have to do with whether or not UHC broke their promises in the insurance agreement.",

(collectively “UHC”).  Each Plaintiff \nsought coverage for post-acute care, and each was eventually denied that coverage.  \nThese denials resulted in worsening injuries and death in some cases.  Plaintiffs, on behalf \nof themselves and others similarly situated, bring seven causes of action under state law \ntheories alleging that UHC’s use of an artificial intelligence program, called nH Predict, to \ndeny coverage was unreasonable.   \nUHC filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ claims.  Because all of Plaintiffs’ claims are \ninexplicably intertwined with a claim for benefits, all of Plaintiffs’ claims are subject to the \nexhaustion of administrative remedies requirement.  The Court, however, will waive \nexhaustion on futility grounds.  Notwithstanding a waiver of the exhaustion requirement, \nthe broad preemption provision in the Medicare Act results in most of Plaintiffs’ claims \nbeing preempted.  Plaintiffs’ claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied \ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, however, survive preemption because those \nclaims do not aim to regulate the same subject matter as the federal standards.  In other \nwords, the Court need only review insurance documents to resolve these claims.  The \nCourt will grant in part and deny in part UHC’s motion to dismiss, allowing the breach of \ncontract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims to proceed.  \nBACKGROUND \nI. FACTS \nPlaintiffs purchased Medicare Advantage (“MA”) health insurance coverage from \nUHC.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 30, 32, Apr. 5, 2024, Docket No. 34.)  UHC sold MA plans as an CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 2 of 24-3- \n alternative to traditional Medicare.  ( Id. ¶¶ 30–31.)  When Plaintiffs purchased MA plans, \nUHC provided a written insurance contract which included a requirement to “provide \nbenefits for covered health services and [] pay all reasonable and medically necessary \nexpenses.”  ( Id. ¶ 32.)  UHC’s insurance agreements also state, “UnitedHealthcare’s \nClinical Services Staff and Physicians make decisions on the health care services you \nreceive based on the appropriateness of care and service and existence of coverage.”  ( Id. \n¶ 187.)   \nOne service that MA plans cover is “post-acute care” which is “medically necessary \ncare” following serious illness or injury.  ( Id. ¶¶ 33–34.)  Post-acute care is covered \nthrough a prospective payment system, meaning that patient claims are evaluated before \nor during treatment.  ( Id. ¶¶ 35–36.)  As such, claim denial can result in termination of \nactive post-acute services or refusal of services before they even commence.  ( Id. ¶¶ 36–\n37.)  When claims are denied, patients must choose to forgo treatment or pay out of \npocket for the services.  ( Id. ¶ 36.)    \nAfter a claim is denied, the Medicare Act outlines a four-level appeals process \nthrough which patients can challenge their coverage denial.  ( Id. ¶ 46.)  First, a patient \nmust appeal to Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIO”), which are independent third-\nparty organizations established to review claims determinations, per the Medicare Act.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 45–46.)  If the QIO affirms the denial, then, the patient may apply for \nreconsideration by the same QIO.  ( Id. ¶ 46.)  Then, if the QIO does not change its position, CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 3 of 24-4- \n the patient may appear before an Administrative Law Judge.  ( Id.)  The final step includes \na hearing before the Medicare Appeals Council.  ( Id.) \nAll Plaintiffs submitted either a pre-authorization or a claim for benefits for post-\nacute care.  ( Id. ¶ 33.)  All claims were eventually denied.  ( Id. ¶¶ 36–37.)  Plaintiffs \nappealed their denials to differing points in the appeals process, but none completed the \nentire appeals procedure.  ( Id. ¶¶ 66–67, 77, 80, 83, 92, 106, 113, 122, 133, 136, 143, 146, \n156.)  Many Plaintiffs paid out of pocket for continuing care, while others went without \ncare.  (E.g. Id. ¶¶ 68, 86.)  The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs suffered \nworsening injury, illness, or death as a result of the denials.  ( Id. ¶¶ 109, 149.)  \nPlaintiffs claim that UHC used an artificial intelligence program, nH Predict AI \nModel (“nH Predict”), in lieu of physicians to make coverage determinations.  ( Id. ¶¶ 37–\n38.)  nH Predict compares the specific patient with similar patients and recommends an \nestimated amount of post-acute care needed.  ( Id. ¶ 39.)  Plaintiffs contend that UHC used \nthis model to determine the amount of coverage an individual patient needed, regardless \nof the recommendation made by their treating physician.  ( Id. ¶¶ 38–39.)  Plaintiffs \ndescribe the nH Predict as applying “rigid criteria” that UHC required its employees to \nfollow under the threat of termination.  ( Id. ¶ 42.)  Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that UHC \nknew of nH Predict’s inaccuracies because over 90% of claim denials are reversed on \nappeal and over 80% of preauthorization denials are reversed.  ( Id. ¶ 47.)  UHC denies any \nuse of nH Predict.  (Def.’s Reply at 10 n.1, July 15, 2024, Docket No. 65.)  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 4 of 24-5- \n Plaintiffs also allege that UHC has frustrated the appeals process.  (Am. Compl. ¶¶ \n48–49, 53.)   Plaintiffs claim that when a patient has a denial overturned, UHC \nimmediately issues another denial letter such that the patient is perpetually stuck in a \nloop of denial, appeal, denial until eventually they give up.  ( Id. ¶ 49.)  Additionally, \nPlaintiffs accuse UHC of approving any appeals that reach the late stages so that \nadministrative remedies are never exhausted.  ( Id. ¶ 53.) \nII. PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nPlaintiffs filed their original class action complaint on November 14, 2023.  (Compl., \nDocket No. 1.)  Plaintiffs amended their class action complaint on April 5, 2024.  (Am. \nCompl.)  Plaintiffs Amended Complaint includes seven state law causes of action: breach \nof contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust \nenrichment, insurance bad faith, negligence per se, unfair and deceptive insurance \npractices, and unfair competition.  ( Id. ¶¶ 183–275.)  Plaintiffs seek damages as well as \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  ( Id. at 58.) UHC filed a motion to dismiss for lack of \njurisdiction for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and also for failure to state a \nclaim upon which relief can be granted based on a theory of preemption.  (Mot. Dismiss, \nMay 20, 2024, Docket No. 41.)   CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 5 of 24-6- \n DISCUSSION \nI. STANDARD OF REVIEW \nArticle III of the Constitution requires that every matter before a court be a case or \ncontroversy.  U.S. C ONST. art. III, § 2.  This requirement must be met throughout all stages \nof the case, not just when the case is filed.  See Burke v. Barnes , 479 U.S. 361, 363 (1987). \nIn deciding a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), the \nCourt must first “distinguish between a ‘facial attack’ and a ‘factual attack.’”  Osborn v. \nUnited States , 918 F.2d 724, 729 n.6 (8th Cir. 1990) (quoting Menchaca v. Chrysler Credit \nCorp., 613 F.2d 507, 511 (5th Cir. 1980)).  A facial challenge requires the court to \n“determine whether the asserted jurisdictional basis is patently meritless by looking to \nthe face of the complaint . . . and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the \nplaintiff.”  Biscanin v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. , 407 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir. 2005) (citations \nomitted).  In a factual attack, the nonmoving party “does not have the benefit of 12(b)(6) \nsafeguards” and the court “inquires into and resolves factual disputes.”  Faibisch v. Univ. \nof Minn., 304 F.3d 797, 801 (8th Cir. 2002).1  \nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the \nCourt considers all facts alleged in the complaint as true to determine if the complaint \nstates a “claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Braden v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. , 588 \n \n \n1 overruled in part on other grounds by Slayden v. Ctr. for Behav. Med. , 53 F.4th 464, 469 \nn.4 (8th Cir. 2022).  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 6 of 24-7- \n F.3d 585, 594 (8th Cir. 2009) (quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009)).  “A claim \nhas facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678.  The Court construes the complaint in the light most favorable to \nthe plaintiff, drawing all inferences in the plaintiff’s favor.  Ashley Cnty., v. Pfizer, Inc. , 552 \nF.3d 659, 665 (8th Cir. 2009).  Although the Court accepts the complaint’s factual \nallegations as true and construes the complaint in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, \nit is “not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  \nPapasan v. Allain , 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986).  In other words, a complaint “does not need \ndetailed factual allegations” but must include “more than labels and conclusions, and a \nformulaic recitation of the elements” to meet the plausibility standard.  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  \nII. ANALYSIS  \nPlaintiffs’ claims face two potential challenges: (1) failure to exhaust administrative \nremedies and (2) federal preemption.  Courts differ in how to evaluate these two issues, \noften blurring the requirements and language, but because failure to exhaust is a \njurisdictional issue, the Court will consider this issue first and then evaluate federal \npreemption.  See generally Yeomans v. Blue Shield of Cal. , 712 F. Supp. 3d 1336, 1343–46 \n(C.D. Cal. 2024).  Because UHC challenges only the allegations in the complaint, the Court \nconstrues the motion as a facial attack on subject matter jurisdiction.  BP Chems. Ltd. v. \nJiangsu Sopo Corp. , 285 F.3d 677, 680 (8th Cir. 2002). CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 7 of 24-8- \n A. Exhaustion  \nThe Court must first determine if Plaintiffs’ claims are subject to the administrative \nexhaustion requirements and, if so, whether Plaintiffs met those requirements.  \n1. Applicability of Exhaustion Requirements \nAny claim arising out of the Medicare Act is subject to administrative exhaustion \ngoverned by Section 405(g) and (h) of the Social Security Act.  42 U.S.C. §§ 405(g)–(h), \n1395ff(b)(1)(A); Heckler v. Ringer , 466 U.S. 602, 605, 614–15 (1984); c.f. Weinberger v. \nSalfi, 422 U.S. 749, 760 (1975) (describing exhaustion of claims arising under the Social \nSecurity Act).  In other words, one must receive a “final decision” by the Secretary before \nbringing an action in federal court.2  42 U.S.C. § 405(g).   \nA claim arises under the Medicare Act when either (1) the “standing and \nsubstantive basis for the presentation” of the claims is the Medicare Act, or (2) it is \n“inextricably intertwined” with a Medicare benefits determination.  Ringer, 466 U.S. at \n614–15.  Claims are “inextricably intertwined” when, despite being brought under \ndifferent laws, they are nothing more than a challenge to a benefits decision.  Id. at 614; \nsee also Reuben v. Ziemer , No. 23-3423, 2024 WL 2477049, at *2–3 (D. Minn. May 1, 2024) \n(finding a claim was “inextricably intertwined” even when the complaint did not reference \n \n \n2 UHC argues that it is not the proper defendant and instead the claims should have been \nbrought against the Secretary.  However, private entities acting on behalf of the United States or \nthe Secretary as a Medicare Advantage Organization are subject to federal action.  Midland \nPsychiatric Assocs., Inc. v. United States , 145 F.3d 1000, 1003–04 (8th Cir. 1998);  Reuben v. Ziemer , \nNo. 23-3423, 2024 WL 2477049, at *3 (D. Minn. May 1, 2024). CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 8 of 24-9- \n the Medicare Act).  In fact, even some claims that challenge Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services (“CMS”) regulations themselves arise under the Medicare Act because \nthey originate out of a denial of benefits.  Phillips v. Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. , 953 F. \nSupp. 2d 1078, 1089 (N.D. Cal. 2011) (finding state law claims that challenged a Medicare \nAdvantage Organization’s conduct as violating the Medicare Act to constitute a claim for \nbenefits that must be exhausted).  \nAlthough Plaintiffs challenge the process of making the denial decision instead of \nthe denial itself, their claims clearly arise from a denial of benefits.  Plaintiffs ultimately \ntake issue with the fact that coverage was denied, and courts generally take an expansive \nview of “arising under” the Medicare Act.  See, e.g., Ringer, 466 U.S. at 614–15.  The \nPlaintiffs’ claims arise under the Medicare Act and are subject to the exhaustion \nrequirements.   \n2. Satisfaction of Exhaustion Requirements \nExhaustion requires two elements: (1) a nonwaivable presentment requirement, \nand (2) a waivable exhaustion requirement.  Bowen v. City of N.Y. , 476 U.S. 467, 483 \n(1986).   \nPresentment is satisfied where plaintiffs submitted a claim for benefits.  Ringer, \n466 U.S. at 617.  All Plaintiffs had claims denied, which means they submitted claims for \nbenefits and thus met the presentment requirement for exhaustion purposes.  However, \nno plaintiff has followed a claim through the entire appeals process and received a final \ndecision by the Medicare Appeals Council. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 9 of 24-10- \n Since Plaintiffs admit exhaustion has not been completed, the Court must \ndetermine whether exhaustion should be waived.  Waiver is appropriate when (1) the \nclaims are collateral, (2) irreparable injury would follow, and (3) exhaustion would be \nfutile.  Mathews v. Eldridge , 424 U.S. 319, 330–31 (1976); see also Bowen , 476 U.S. at 485. \nFirst, the Court finds it difficult to conceive of a situation where claims that arise \nunder the Medicare Act could also be “wholly collateral” to their overall claim for benefits \nunder the Act.  In re Heritage Sw. Med. Grp., P.A. , 309 B.R. 916, 920 (N.D. Tex. 2004); see \nalso Kaiser v. Blue Cross of Calif. , 347 F.3d 1107, 1115 (9th Cir. 2003).   So, while Plaintiffs \naccurately cite other precedent that presents similar factual circumstances where courts \nfound the claims were collateral, those cases did not first evaluate whether the claims \narose out of the underlying Act.  See Schoolcraft v. Sullivan , 971 F.2d 81, 86 (8th Cir. 1992) \n(evaluating a challenge to the appeals process of the Social Security Act); Bowen, 476 U.S. \nat 485 (same).  Because the claims arise out of the Medicare Act, the Court concludes that \nit cannot find the claims are “wholly collateral” to the Plaintiffs’ claims for benefits.    \nSecond, a finding that the claims are not wholly collateral is not dispositive, \nbecause the Plaintiffs allegedly suffered irreparable harm and showed the futility of \nexhausting administrative remedies.  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 484 (“The ultimate decision of \nwhether to waive exhaustion should not be made solely by mechanical application of the \nEldridge factors, but should also be guided by the policies underlying the exhaustion \nrequirement.”).  Further, the Eighth Circuit has not conclusively determined, and circuits CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 10 of 24-11- \n differ, whether all three factors need to be met before waiver is appropriate.  Compare \nTitus v. Sullivan , 4 F.3d 590, 592 (8th Cir. 1993) (combining the waiver requirements with \n“and”) with In Home Health, Inc. v. Shalala , 272 F.3d 554, 560 (8th Cir. 2001) (combining \nthe waiver requirements with “ or”); see also Timmerman v. Thompson , No. 03-5221, 2004 \nWL 1765285, at *3–4 (D. Minn. Aug. 5, 2004) (explaining that the Eighth Circuit has not \nresolved this issue).   \nIrreparable harm is shown when a “deferment of judicial review until exhaustion \nof administrative remedies would cause [plaintiffs] injury that cannot be remedied by \nlater payment of the benefits requested.” Martin v. Shalala , 63 F.3d 497, 505 (7th Cir. \n1995); see also Manakee Pro. Med. Transfer Serv.,  Inc. v. Shalala , 71 F.3d 574, 581 (6th Cir. \n1995) (citing Eldridge, 424 U.S. at 331).  The Court has found no irreparable harm when \nbenefits continued during a pending appeal.  Timmerman , 2004 WL 1765285, at *5.  The \nfact that post-acute care claims require preauthorization or ongoing authorization makes \nthese claims unique because in order to continue receiving care, people often have to pay \nfor care themselves.  ( See, e.g., Am. Compl. ¶ 68.)  As evidenced in the Amended \nComplaint, many patients who had to decline treatment later suffered worsening injuries \nand even death.  Plaintiffs have therefore shown irreparable harm.   \nThird, UHC’s actions that make any attempt to fully exhaust the administrative \nremedies futile support a waiver determination.  The futility prong addresses whether \npursuit of relief through the administrative process will “serve the purposes of CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 11 of 24-12- \n exhaustion, and not be futile in the context of the system.” Kaiser, 347 F.3d at 1115.  \nExhaustion serves to “prevent[] premature interference with agency processes, so that \nthe agency may function efficiently and so that it may have an opportunity to correct its \nown errors, to afford the parties and the courts the benefit of its experience and \nexpertise, and to compile a record . . . .” Id. at 1115 n.4 (quoting Salfi, 422 U.S. at 765).   \nTwo allegations, taken as true at the motion to dismiss stage, make the appeals \nprocess futile.  First, UHC allegedly issues repeated denials any time a patient is successful \non appeal.  As a result, any time a patient gets a denial overturned, another denial is on \nits way.  Second, for the very few appeals that reach the end of the appeals process, UHC \nallegedly pays the claims and terminates the process.  As alleged in the Complaint, this \npractice would make it virtually impossible for any claim to progress through the entire \nfour-step appeals process and be ripe for judicial review.  Thus, the irreparable injury and \nfutility of the appeals process suggests that waiver of administrative exhaustion is \nappropriate.  \nThe Medicare Act is clear in declaring that any claim “arising under” the Medicare \nAct must first progress through the administrative process before a district court can \nexercise jurisdiction.  While the exhaustion of administrative remedies is required in \nalmost every case, it is not absolute.  There are unique circumstances in which it is CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 12 of 24-13- \n appropriate for the Court to waive that requirement.3  Here, the Court is presented with \nsuch a case.  These Plaintiffs allegedly suffered great harm, up to and including death, \nbecause of an allegedly defective procedure of denying claims compounded by efforts to \nobliterate any means of effective review through the administrative process.  As a result, \nthe Court will find that although Plaintiffs’ claims were subject to administrative review, \nwaiver is appropriate such that the Court can exercise jurisdiction.  \nB. Federal Preemption \nThe Court must next determine if any of the claims fail to state a claim upon which \nrelief can be granted because they are preempted by federal law.   \nUnder the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, federal law “shall be the supreme \nLaw of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby any Thing in the \nConstitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.”  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. \n2.  In other words, “state laws that conflict with federal law are without effect.”  Altria \nGrp., Inc. v. Good , 555 U.S. 70, 76 (2008) (citation and quotation omitted).  “The purpose \nof Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption case.”  Id. (cleaned up).  The \nCourt begins its “analysis with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States \nare not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest \n \n \n3 UHC contends that waiver is only applicable for Constitutional claims relying on Califano \nv. Sanders , 430 U.S. 99, 109 (1977).  However, Califano merely indicates that when a \nconstitutional question is at issue, there is a presumed judicial review.  Id.  That proposition alone \ndoes not foreclose the potential for waiver under other circumstances. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 13 of 24-14- \n purpose of Congress.”  Id. at 77 (cleaned up).  When the statute includes an express \npreemption provision, the Court must first look to the statutory language to determine \nCongress’s purpose.  Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass’n v. Wehbi , 18 F.4th 956, 971 (8th Cir. 2021).   \nThe Medicare Act, as amended in 2003, states, “The standards established under \n[Part C] shall supersede any State law or regulation (other than State licensing laws or \nState laws relating to plan solvency) with respect to MA plans which are offered by MA \norganizations under [Part C].”  42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3) (effective Dec. 8, 2003); 42 \nC.F.R. § 422.402.  Prior to the 2003 amendment, the preemption clause included a \nrequirement that the state law or regulation be “inconsistent” with the federal standard.  \n42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3)(A) (effective Dec. 21, 2000 to Dec. 7, 2003).  In conjunction \nwith the amendment, CMS has issued several statements indicating that the amendment \nintended to expand the scope of the preemption clause, including the common law to the \nextent it would “specifically regulate an MA plan.”  Do Sung Uhm v. Humana, Inc. , 620 \nF.3d 1134, 1156 (9th Cir. 2010) (citing 70 Fed. Reg. 4588-01, 4665 (Jan. 28, 2005)).  All \ncourts accept that “standard” means a “statutory provision or a regulation promulgated \nunder [the Medicare Act] published in the Code of Federal Regulations.”  Wehbi, 18 F.4th \nat 971. \n1. Common Law Claims \nA threshold issue requires the Court to evaluate whether the preemption clause \ncategorically excludes common law claims under Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine , 537 U.S. \n51 (2002).  Despite the similarities, the Court finds that Sprietsma  is distinguishable.   CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 14 of 24-15- \n In Sprietsma , the Supreme Court determined that the phrase “a law or regulation” \nin the Federal Boat Safety Act (“FBSA”) most likely excluded common law claims and only \nencompassed positive legal enactments.  Id. at 63.  Sprietsma  excluded common law \nclaims because of the article “a” and the occurrence of law and regulation together.  Id.  \nThe Supreme Court further noted the FBSA’s saving clause excludes common law liability \nfrom the preemption clause.  Id.  \nThe preemption clause in the Medicare Act differs from that in the FBSA in two \nsignificant ways.  First, it states “ any law or regulation” instead of “ a law or regulation.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3) (emphasis added); 46 U.S.C. § 4306 (emphasis added).   \nSecond, the Medicare Act contains no such savings clause for common law claims, and \ninstead only explicitly excludes state licensing and claims related to plan solvency.  42 \nU.S.C. § 1395w-26(b)(3); Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg , 572 U.S. 273, 283 (2014) (describing \nSprietsma ’s substantial reliance on the FBSA savings clause).  \nTrue, the Medicare Act preemption language mirrors that of the FBSA in that it \nuses both the terms “law” and “regulation.”  As in Sprietsma , that would indicate an \nintention to reference only positive enactments to avoid surplusage.  537 U.S. at 63.  \nHowever, the Medicare Act’s language differs by the use of “any” and the lack of a savings \nclause for common law claims.  The difference between “a” and “any” is significant \nbecause “a” implies “discreteness,” while “any” implies a more expansive scope.  \nCompare id.  (analyzing “a”) with Ali v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons , 552 U.S. 214, 218–19 (2008) CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 15 of 24-16- \n (analyzing “any”).  The use of “any” in the Medicare Act’s preemption clause thus \nbroadens the language.  Ali, 552 U.S. 219; Northwest , 572 U.S. at 283 (explaining that \nbroader wording in an express preemption clause is a critical difference from the clause \nin Sprietsma ).   \nIn addition to the differences in statutory language, the preemption clause in the \nMedicare Act is undisputedly broader than that in the FBSA.  The 2003 amendment \nspecifically removed any requirement that state laws must be inconsistent.  42 U.S.C. § \n1395w-26(b)(3)(A) (effective Dec. 21, 2000 to Dec. 7, 2003).  Further, CMS has clarified \nthat at least some common law claims are preempted.  70 Fed.Reg. at 4665.   \nTherefore, because the language is not limited by the article “a,” the preemption \nprovision includes no savings clause for common law claims, and CMS has indicated its \nintent to preempt at least some common law claims, the Court will apply the preemption \nclause to common law claims when appropriate, and not limit its application to positive \nenactments of state law. \n2. Scope of Express Preemption  \nWith the acknowledgement that preemption may apply to all of Plaintiffs’ claims, \nthe Court must now evaluate the scope of the express preemption clause.   \nThe Eighth Circuit addressed the scope of the Medicare Act’s preemption clause in \nWehbi, 18 F.4th at 970–72.  Wehbi held that state laws are preempted if they “(1) regulate \nthe same subject matter as federal Medicare [standards] (in which case they are expressly \npreempted), or (2) otherwise frustrate the purpose of a federal Medicare [standards] (in CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 16 of 24-17- \n which case they are impliedly preempted).”  18 F.4th at 971.  Wehbi reached its \nconclusion by acknowledging the expansion but describing two remaining limitations: \nfirst, the language “with respect to [Medicare Parts C-D] plans” and second only when the \nfederal standard “supersedes” state law.  18 F.4th at 971.  The court further defined \n“supersede” to mean displace.  Id.  The court summarized its analysis of the preemption \nexpansion by noting it went from conflict to field preemption.4  Id. at 971–72.     \nUHC relies primarily on Ninth Circuit precedent, which the Plaintiffs claim takes a \nmore expansive view of the Medicare Act’s preemption clause than required.  However, \nit is not immediately clear to the Court how distinct the tests actually are.  The Ninth \nCircuit has described the preemption clause as applying to anything that is “directly \ngoverned by federal standards.”  Uhm, 620 F.3d at 1158.  Essentially, under this view \npreemption would cover any state law or regulation if a federal standard exists.  Morrison \nv. Health Plan of Nev. , 328 P.3d 1165, 1168–70 (Nev. 2014).  And the Tenth Circuit has \nfound that the Medicare Act’s expanded preemption clause is similar to field preemption.  \nPharm. Care Mgmt. Ass’n v. Mulready .  78 F.4th 1183, 1207–08 (10th Cir. 2023); see also \nMedicaid and Medicare Advantage Prods. Ass’n of P.R., Inc. v Emanuelli Hernandez , 58 \nF.4th 5, 12–13 (1st Cir. 2023).    \n \n \n4 Field preemption exists when “Congress has forbidden the State to take action in the \nfield that the federal statute pre-empts,” and conflict preemption exists where “compliance with \nboth state and federal law is impossible.”  Pharm. Rsch. & Mfrs. of Am. v. McClain , 95 F.4th 1136, \n1140 (8th Cir. 2024) (quotations omitted).   CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 17 of 24-20- \n evaluation of the medical payments Plaintiffs allegedly should have received would \nregulate the covered serves already regulated by the Medicare Act.  As such, the unjust \nenrichment claim is expressly preempted. \nThe bad faith insurance claims fail for similar reasons.  Plaintiffs alleged that the \nstates in which they assert bad faith insurance claims “prohibit using bad faith or \nunreasonable means to make coverage determinations under an insurance policy.”  (Am. \nCompl. ¶ 214.)  Initially, the bad faith insurance laws seem to only require the Court to \ndetermine the motivation behind the coverage denials.  However, a finding of liability on \nthe bad faith insurance claims would force the Court to evaluate whether the denial of \ncoverage was reasonable and whether the use of nH Predict to make that denial decision \nwas reasonable.  The Medicare Act squarely regulates how coverage decisions are to be \nmade and what services are covered.  42 C.F.R. §§ 422.101, 422.566.  Thus, a \ndetermination on the reasonableness of denial or the reasonableness of how coverage \ndecisions are made would aim to regulate the same subject matter as the Medicare Act. \nBecause any evaluation of the bad faith insurance claims would require the Court to \nevaluate standards promulgated by the Medicare Act, as opposed to standards included \nonly in UHC’s own written documents, the Court finds the bad faith insurance claims to \nbe preempted.  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 20 of 24-21- \n In sum, the breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and \nfair dealing claims are not preempted, and thus may proceed.  But the unjust enrichment \nand bad faith insurance claims are preempted and will be dismissed. \nb. Statutory Claims \nPlaintiffs bring three statutory claims under Oregon’s Unfair Claims Settlements \nPractices Act, the Minnesota Unfair Claims Practices Act (“MUCPA”),5 and California’s \nUnfair Competition Law and Insurance Code.  All three statutes essentially require \ninsurers to use reasonable standards for prompt, individualized evaluation of insurance \nclaims.6  Because the Medicare Act describes how insurance claim decisions are to be \nmade and the time frame for such decisions, these statutes directly regulate the same \nsubject matter.  See 42 C.F.R. §§ 422.101, 422.566, 422.568.  \nThe only manner in which these claims could survive preemption then would be a \nfinding that the state standards supplement the federal standards as permitted under \nWehbi.  18 F.4th 973.  However, the Court cannot expand Wehbi’s supplemental standard  \nto this case.  First, Wehbi allowed states to supplement the federal regulations under a \n \n \n5 The parties dispute whether the Minnesota Unfair Claims Practices Act allows for a \nprivate right of action.  A private right of action seems likely based on Findling v. Grp. Health Plan, \nInc., 998 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Minn. 2023), but as the MUCPA claim is preempted, the Court need not \nresolve that issue here.  \n6 Plaintiffs’ claim under Oregon’s Unfair Claims Settlements Practices Act also raises the \nissue of prompt and sufficient notice of denial.  However, 42 C.F.R. § 422.568 heavily regulates \nthe timeframe and notice requirements of organization determinations.  So, the notice portion \nof the claim, while distinct, is also preempted. CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 21 of 24-22- \n specific set of circumstances.  The issue in that case concerned pharmacy benefits, which \nWebhi noted is an area typically left to the states.  Id. at 972–73.  Here, the Plaintiffs have \nnot presented the Court with any basis to find that coverage decisions are typically left to \nthe states.   \nFurther, Wehbi allowed states to provide the specifics when the federal standards \nwere broad and generalized.  Id. at 973.  But the federal standards here are not as \ngeneralized as those discussed in Wehbi.  Compare 42 C.F.R. § 422.101 (requiring a \nmedical necessity determination based on whether the services are reasonable or \nnecessary and also the “enrollee’s medical history, . . . physician recommendations, and \nclinical notes”) with 42 C.F.R. § 423.505(b)(18) (mandating a “standard contract with \nreasonable and relevant terms and conditions”).   \nFinally, even if the Medicare standards were sufficiently general, it is unclear that \nthe state laws that Plaintiffs suggest supplement the Medicare standards would provide \nany additional specificity.  The state laws would only impose an additional requirement \nthat the insurers use “reasonable standards” in making coverage decisions.  Thus, while \nWehbi certainly suggests there are situations where states could provide supplemental, \ncomplementary standards to the federal Medicare Act standards, that is not the case \nhere.  As a result, the statutory claims are expressly preempted.   \n* * * CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 22 of 24-23- \n The Court finds that although the Plaintiffs’ claims were subject to the \nadministrative exhaustion requirements, Plaintiffs presented sufficient information to \nsatisfy application of the waiver doctrine.  Yet even after surmounting the jurisdictional \nhurdle, most of the claims fail under preemption.  As a result, the only claims that survive \nboth exhaustion and preemption are the claims for breach of contract and for breach of \nthe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  The remaining claims will be \ndismissed.  \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs bring a putative class action contesting UHC’s use of nH Predict, rather \nthan actual people, to make coverage decisions, contradicting UHC’s insurance policy \ndocuments.  Because all the Plaintiffs’ claims originate after a denial of benefits, the \nMedicare Act requires Plaintiffs to exhaust all administrative remedies before the Court \ncan exercise subject matter jurisdiction.  No plaintiff has met this requirement.  But \nbecause the Court finds that Plaintiffs suffered irreparable injury and that exhaustion \nwould be futile, the Court will waive this requirement.  Waiving the exhaustion \nrequirement does not save all of Plaintiffs’ claims, however; those claims must also \nwithstand the broad preemption clause.  Because the unjust enrichment, bad faith \ninsurance, and state statutory claims regulate the same subject matter as the Medicare \nAct, those claims are preempted.  The only claims that survive, then, are the claims for \nbreach of contract and for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing \nbecause the Court will only need to evaluate compliance with the insurance agreements.  CASE 0:23-cv-03514-JRT-SGE     Doc. 91     Filed 02/13/25     Page 23 of 24-24- \n Accordingly, the Court will grant in part and deny in part UHC’s motion to dismiss, allowing \nPlaintiffs’ breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair \ndealing claims to proceed.  \nORDER \nBased on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS \nHEREBY ORDERED that Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss [Docket No. 41] is GRANTED in \npart and DENIED in part as follows:  \n1.

Colo.)  \n_________________________________  \nORDER  \n_________________________________  \nBefore TYMKOVICH, CARSON, and FEDERICO , Circuit Judges. \n_________________________________  \nThis matter is before the court following Mr. Stewart’s response to this court’s \nJune 27, 2025, show cause order. Upon consideration, we conclude that we lack \njurisdiction for the following reasons.  \n This court raised jurisdictional concerns regarding Federal Rule of Appellate \nProcedure 3 and the finality of the order Mr. Stewart sought to appeal. Rule 3(c) requires that the notice of appeal designate the order or judgment being appealed. This Rule’s \nrequirements are jurisdictional and failure to comply with them deprives this court of \njurisdiction. See Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 248 (1992) (“Rule 3’s dictates are \njurisdictional in nature, and their satisfaction is a prerequisite to appellate review.”).\n FILED  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nTenth Circuit  \n \nJuly 16, 2025  \n \nChristopher M. Wolpert  \nClerk of Court  Appellate Case: 25-1250     Document: 14     Date Filed: 07/16/2025     Page: 1 2 \n  In his notice of appeal, Mr. Stewart failed to identify an order from which he \nappealed. In his response to the show cause order, he identified the following three \ndocuments as the subject of his appeal:  \n1.    Docket Entry 4 – Emergency Ex Parte Motion for Asset Freeze \n(Filed Sept. 12, 2019) . . .  \n2.    Docket Entry 35 – Stipulated Preliminary Injunction and Asset \nFreeze (Entered Oct. 10, 2019) . . .  \n3.    Docket Entry 36 –  Cancellation of Show Cause Hearing (Oct. \n10, 2019) . . .  \n \nResponse at 2-3.  \n Mr. Stewart’s response does not resolve this court’s Rule 3 concerns. Indeed, \nwhile he says that he is appealing from matters entered on the district court docket in 2019, the underlying case from which he appeals did not begin until he was indicted on \nFebruary 4, 2021. Further, docket entry 4 is not an Emergency Ex Parte Motion for Asset \nFreeze. Rather, it is the sealed indictment. Likewise, docket entry 35 is not a Stipulated \nPreliminary Injunction and Asset Freeze. Rather, it is a motion to continue filed by his \nco-defendant. And docket entry 36 is not a Cancellation of Show Cause Hearing. Rather, \nit is the district court’s order granting the continuance. Mr. Stewart attempts to appeal \nfrom orders that do not exist.\n \n Because the designation requirement of Rule 3 is jurisdictional, and Mr. Stewart’s \nresponse fails to meet the jurisdictional prerequisites to appeal, this court is “without jurisdiction under the facts of this case.” Jenkins v. Burtzloff, 69 F.2d 460, 464 (10th Cir. \n1995).  Appellate Case: 25-1250     Document: 14     Date Filed: 07/16/2025     Page: 2 3 \n Finally, the court notes that Mr. Stewart’s response relied on multiple cases and \ncitations that do not exist. The court is concerned that, due to inconsistent references to \nthe district court’s docket and reference to hallucinatory case law, artificial intelligence \nwas used, at least in part, to draft Mr. Stewart’s response.   \nTenth Circuit Rule 46.5(B) states:  \n \nBy presenting to the court –  whether by signing . . . filing, [or] submitting \n. . . – a brief, motion, or other paper, an attorney or unrepresented party \ncertifies that, to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief, \nformed after an inquir y reasonable under the circumstances . . . the issues \npresented are warranted by existing law . . ..  \n  \nCitations to hallucinatory case law violate this rule.

Cl. \nNov. 28, 2022) ( Aljindi III ).  We affirmed that ruling.  \nAljindi v. United States, No. 21-1295C, 2023 WL 2778689, \nat *2 –3 (Fed. Cir. Apr. 5, 2023) ( Aljindi IV ).  We also de-\nclined to consider Dr. Aljindi’s argument on appeal that the Claims Court erred by dismissing his taking s claim be-\ncause we had already affirmed the Claims Court’s dismis-\nsal of that claim in Aljindi II .  Id.  at *2 n.3.  \nThe second case of relevance to the present action was \ninitiated by Dr. Aljindi ’s July 2021 filing of a pro se com-\nplaint in the Claims Court.  Complaint, Aljindi v. United States, No. 21-1578C, 2021 WL 5177430 (Fed. Cl. Aug. 30, \n2021), ECF No.  1.  Dr. Aljindi sought $32.7 million in dam-\nages for alleged judicial misconduct ( i.e., bribery, fraud, \nand obstruction of justice) committed by judges in other \ncourts through their dismissals of his intellectual- property \n(including copyright) claims, and for the SBA’s  then- recent \nless-than- affirmative response to the application for a loan \n(under the EIDL program) to his business, AI Net Group \nLLC.  Id.  at 2–4, 6–7; Aljindi v. United States, No. 21 -\n1578C, 2021 WL 5177430, at *1– 3 (Fed. Cl. Aug. 30, 2021) \n(Aljindi SBA Opinion ).  The Claims Court (Judge Tapp) \ndismissed his complaint .  Aljindi SBA Opinion , at *1, *4 .  \nIt held that the judicial -misconduct claim was outside its \njurisdiction and that, regarding the SBA allegations, the \ncomplaint did not  state a claim upon which relief could be \ngranted.  Aljindi SBA Opinion , at * 2–3.  On the SBA claim, \nthe Claims Court explained that, “[e]ven if SBA’s EIDL de-\ncisions are reviewable,” the SBA’s decision was not final: SBA notified Dr. Aljindi that it needed additional docu-\nmentation to review the application but Dr. Aljindi did not \nallege that he provided such documentation.  I d. at *3.  And \neven if SBA issued a final decision, the Claims Court ex-plained, Dr. Aljindi had failed to state a claim upon which Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 4     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 5 \nrelief could be granted because he “ha[d] not availed him-\nself of the administrative remedies available to him.”  Id.  \nB \nOn February 14, 2024, Dr. Aljindi filed the complaint \nin this case, seeking $65.4 million in compensation.  Com-plaint at 19, Aljindi v. United States, No. 24 -242, 2024 WL \n3024654 (Fed. Cl. June 17, 2024), ECF No.  1 (Claims Court \nCompl.) ; S. Appx . 1;\n2 Appellee’s Response Br. at 4.  The \ncomplaint includes two counts for relief —first, a claim for \nan alleged Fifth Amendment taking of his 2015 research , \nClaims Court Compl . at 2–15; second, a claim of intentional \nand systemic retaliation committed by SBA in denying an \nEIDL for AI Net Group LLC, id.  at 15–19.  See Claims \nCourt Opinion , at *1 –2, *4.  Dr. Aljindi simultaneously \nmoved for summary judgment.  Id.  at *1.  The case was \nassigned to Judge Tapp.  Notice of Direct Assignment, \nAljindi v. United States, No. 24 -242, 2024 WL 3024654 \n(Fed. Cl. June 17, 2024), ECF No.  7 (Notice of Direct As-\nsignment) .  On February 20, 2024, Dr. Aljindi moved to dis-\nqualify Judge Tapp.  S.  Appx.  60–84.  On April 17, 2024, \nthe government moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant \nto Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC).  S. Appx.  10–24. \nThe Claims Court granted the government’s motion to \ndismiss and denied Dr. Aljindi’s motion for summary judg-\nment as moot.  Claims Court Opinion , at *1 , *5.  Noting \nthat Dr. Aljindi cited five different government documents \n(published between October 2016 and August 2019) as evi-\ndence for his Fifth Amendment taking s claim, the Claims \nCourt ruled that Dr. Aljindi’s claim involving one govern-\nment component ( the National Science and Technology \nCouncil , or NSTC) was time -barred by the six -year statute \n \n2  “S. Appx .” refers to the Supplemental Appendix \nsubmitted by the Appellee . Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 5     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 6 \nof limitations in 28 U.S.C. §  2501 but that his claims relat-\ning to other government components3 were timely .  Id.  at \n*2 & n.1.  Nevertheless, the Claims Court concluded that \nthe taking s claim was barred in whole by the doctrine of \nres judicata and also because it was “not facially plausible.”  \nId. at *2 –4.  To the extent that the taking s claim could be \ninterpreted to be asserting intellectual -property theft, the \nClaims Court added, the claim would be a tort claim  out-\nside its jurisdiction.  Id.  at *3; 28 U.S.C. §  1491(a)(1).  Re-\ngarding the alleged retaliation by SBA in handling the \nrequest for an EIDL for AI Net Group LLC, the Claims  \nCourt concluded that R ule 83.1 of the Claims Court’s Rules \nbarred Dr. Aljindi, a pro se plaintiff, from representing AI Net Group LLC or any other entity besides himself and, \nthus, his SBA retaliation claim had to be dismissed for lack of prosecution under Rule 41(b).  Id. at *4 –5. \nOn the same day that it issued its opinion dismissing \nDr. Aljindi’s complaint, the Claims Court denied Dr. Aljindi’s motion to disqualify Judge Tapp.  Order, Aljindi v. United States , No. 24 -242, 2024 WL 3024654 (Fed. Cl. \nJune 17, 2024), ECF No.  25 (Order); S.  Appx.  60–84.  In his \nmotion to disqualify, Dr. Aljindi cited the decisions in the two cases discussed in Part I.A above  and argued that they \nsupport ed his allegation that Judge Tapp was prejudiced \nagainst him and must disqualify himself pursuant to 28  \nU.S.C. §  455.  S.  Appx.  60–61.  Dr. Aljindi also argued that \nChief Judge Kaplan should hear his case as he had “[t]yped [her] name” in his filings.  S.  Appx.  61.  In denying Dr. \nAljindi’s motion to disqualify, the Claims Court explained \nthat Dr. Aljindi h ad “fail[ed] to identify any personal bias \nor prejudice” on the part of Judge Tapp and that the prior \n \n3  Those other components are the  Office of the Direc-\ntor of National Intelligence, Department of Defense, De-partment of Justice, and National Institute of Standards \nand Technology.  Id. at *2 n.1.  Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 6     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 7 \nrulings did not constitute a proper basis for disqualification  \nfor bias or prejudice.  Order at 1–2. \nDr. Aljindi timely appealed.  We have jurisdiction un-\nder 28 U.S.C. §  1295(a)(3).  \nII \nIn this case, where the factual allegations of the com-\nplaint are not challenge d for purposes of the dismissal mo-\ntion, we review the dismissal (for lack of jurisdiction or for \nfailure to state a claim) de novo.  Taylor v. United States, \n959 F.3d 1081, 1086 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (citations omitted) .  \n“In either case, ‘[w]e take all factual allegations in the com-plaint as true and construe the facts in the light most fa-vorable to the non -moving party.’”  Inter- Tribal Council of \nArizona, Inc. v. United States, 956 F.3d 1328, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (alteration in the original) (citations omitted ).  \nAlthough pleadings by pro se litigants are held to “less \nstringent standards” than those for lawyers, pro se plain-\ntiffs must still meet their jurisdictional burden.  Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 –21 (1972); Kelley v. Secretary, \nU.S. Department of Labor, 812 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1987).  A trial court has “broad discretion to manage [its] docket[] .”  Procter & Gamble Co. v. Kraft Foods Global, Inc. , \n549 F.3d 842, 848– 49 (Fed. Cir. 2008).  We review the de-\nnial of a motion to disqualify under 28  U.S.C. §  455 for \nabuse of discretion.  Allphin v. United States, 758 F.3d \n1336, 1343– 44 (Fed. Cir. 2014); Shell Oil Co. v. United \nStates, 672 F.3d 1283, 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2012).  We address \nthe taking s issue , then the retaliation issue , and finally the \ndisqualification  issue . \nA \nDr. Aljindi challenges the Claims Court’s dismissal of \nhis taking s claim, arguing that the government “has taken \nhis property by engaging in research” in the “combined \nfield of [information security, artificial intelligence (AI), Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 7     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 8 \nand legacy information systems (LIS)].”  Appellant’s Infor-\nmal Br. at 19.  We reject the challenge.  \nRegarding the taking s claim related to a published \nstrategic plan  of the NSTC, t he Claims Court properly held \nthat claim to be  time-barred by 28 U.S.C. §  2501.  Claim \nCourt Opinion , at *2.  That provision, which is a jurisdic-\ntional limitation, John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United \nStates, 552 U.S. 130. 133 –34 (2008) , requires that a claim \nbe brought “within six years after such claim first accrues ,” \n28 U.S.C. §  2501.  Dr. Aljindi contends that the “six -year[] \nstatute of limitation s does not apply here simply because \nthe 2016 example [of the NSTC strategic plan] .  . . was dis-\ncovered by [him] around December 2018.”  Appellant’s In-form al Br. at 24.  But “[a] claim first accrues when all the \nevents have occurred that fix the alleged liability of the government and entitle the claimant to institute an ac-tion, ” Ingrum v. United States, 560 F.3d 1311, 1314 (Fed. \nCir. 2009) , and Dr. Aljindi did not establish in the Claims \nCourt and does not establish here that the publication was \nconcealed or unknowable or that he should not have known \nof it, see id. at 1314– 14; Appellant’s Informal Br. at 19, 24, \nso there is no basis for suspending the accru al past the \nNSTC publication date  in 2016, more than six years before \nhis suit here.  \nDr. Aljindi also has not identified reversible error in \nthe Claims Court’s holding that  the taking s claim  (as to the \ntimely and untimely challenged uses) was precluded by the doctrine of res judicata  based on the Aljindi IP litigation .  \nSee Claims Court Opinion , at *2 –3.  “A claim is barred by \nres judicata when ‘ (1) the parties are identical or in privity; \n(2) the first suit proceeded to a final judgment on the mer-\nits; and (3) the second claim is based on the same set of transactional facts as the first. ’”  Cunningham v. United \nStates, 748 F.3d 1172, 1179 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Ammex, Inc. v. United States, 334 F.3d 1052, 1055 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).   All three elements are present here. Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 8     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 9 \nFirst, the parties (Dr. Aljindi and the United States) \nare identical to the parties in the Aljindi IP  litigation.  Sec-\nond, Dr. Aljindi’s Fifth Amendment taking s claim was pre-\nviously dismissed  in Aljindi I  (and affirmed in Aljindi II  \nand Aljindi IV) for failure to state a claim upon which relief \ncould be granted.  Aljindi I, at *2; Aljindi II , at *3; Aljindi \nIV, at *2 n.3; see Claims Court Opinion , at *3 .  A dismissal \nfor failure to state a claim constitutes a final judgment on \nthe merits, and thus has res judicata effect.  See Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board , 978 F.2d 679, 687 (Fed. \nCir. 1992).  Third, we agree with the Claims Court that his “present takings claim is based on the same set of transac-tional facts as his prior [ Aljindi IP] litigation ” because his \npresent case against “ALL formal AI Strategies published by the federal government” necessarily includes the 2019 publication by the D epartment of Defense that was the fo-\ncus of his prior claim.  Claims Court Opinion , at *3.  Dr. \nAljindi is attempting to litigate “issues that were or could have been raised” in his earlier suit, which res judicata pre-\nvents.  See First Mortgage Corp. v. United States, 961 F.3d \n1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nDr. Aljindi has similarly shown no error in the Claims \nCourt’s dismissal of the taking s claim for failure to meet \nthe pleading standard of setting forth facts that plausibly establish the elements of the asserted wrong.  Claims \nCourt Opinion , at *3 –4; but see Appellant’s Informal Br. at \n19 (arguing the claim is “facially plausible”).  Dr. Aljindi \nhad to allege plausibly , among other things, that he owned \nproperty protected by the Takings Clause and that it was \ntaken by the government .  He has pleaded that h e discov-\nered the entire field of research into the relationship be-\ntween information security, artificial intelligence, and \nlegacy information systems,  Claims Court Compl. at 4, but  \nat a minimum he has not shown that it is plausible that he  \nhas a cognizable property interest (for Takings Clause pur-poses) in that general idea and “everything built on top of’ Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 9     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 10 \n[his] research”  and that the government has taken that \nfrom him , Claims Court Opinion , at *4.  \nB \nDr. Aljindi challenges the Claims Court’s dismissal of \nhis claim of systemic and intentional retaliation by SBA for \nlack of prosecution, arguing that he “can pursue this claim \npro se on behalf of his single member LLC and disregarded \nentity company because he is the founder and the only \nowner of his company” and because “the SBA’s retaliation \nis directed toward [him] directly because of his federally \nprotected classes, statuses, and federally protected activi-ties.”  Appellant’s Informal Br. at 19 –20.  We di sagree.  The \nClaims Court correctly found that , even when reading the \ncorrespondence with SBA that Dr. Aljindi provided, the SBA’s action regarding the requested EIDL was directed at \nAI Net Group LLC and thus his claim is “on behalf of AI \nNet Group LLC, not Dr. Aljindi as an individual.”  Claims \nCourt Opinion , at *4 ; Claims Court Compl. Ex. at 368 (SBA \ndocument confirming receipt of documents for an EIDL ap-plication for AI Net Group LLC).  Under the Claims Court’s Rule 83.1, Dr. Aljindi cannot represent AI Net Group LLC, \nand the Claims Court’s dismissal, under its Rule 41(b), for \nDr. Aljindi’s failure to comply with this rule is not an abuse of discretion.  See Claims Court Opinion , at *4.  We there-\nfore affirm the Claims Court’s dismissal for lack of prose-\ncution.  Id . \nWe also agree with the Claims Court that if Dr. Aljindi \nbrought this claim on behalf of himself, the Claims Court \nwould lack jurisdiction because retaliation claims are tort \nclaims.  Id. at *4 & n.8; 28 U.S.C. §  1491(a)(1); see Aljindi \nII, at *1.  To the extent Dr. Aljindi claims discrimination \nhere, there is no basis for Claims Court jurisdiction over \nsuch a claim.   See Aljindi I , at *1 –2; Aljindi II , at *1 –2; \nBrown v. United States , 105 F.3d 621, 623 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 10     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 11 \nC \nDr. Aljindi challenges the Claims Court’s d enial  of his \nmotion to disqualify, arguing that Judge Tapp denied his \nsummary -judgment motion as moot “illegally and mali-\nciously,” that his “actions are criminal,” and that his “mo-\ntive was malicious and retaliatory.”  Appellant’s Informal \nBr. at 20– 21.4  The assertions supply no basis for setting \naside Judge Tapp’s decision not to disqualify himself.  \nDr. Aljindi cites to Judge Tapp’s prior dismissals of his \ncomplaints, id., but he has no right to a new judge because \nhe has earlier lost before a given judge, and that judge has gained some knowledge of the litigant .  See Liteky v. United \nStates, 510 U.S. 540, 551  (1994) ( “[N]ot subject to depreca-\ntory characterization as ‘bias’ or ‘prejudice’ are opinions held by judges as a result of what they learned in earlier \nproceedings.  It has long been regarded as normal and \nproper for a judge to sit in the same case upon its remand , \nand to sit in successive trials involving the same defend-\nant.”).  He cites to various procedural orders, such as the \ncourt’s grant of the government’s motion for extension of \ntime, Appellant’s Informal Br.  at 21– 22, but t hose are \nsimply examples of the c ourt exercising its inherent au-\nthority to manage its docket, and nothing indicates that the \ncourt abused its discretion in exercising that discretion , \nmuch less did so in a way that supplies a ground for dis-\nqualification .  Dr . Aljindi supplies no basis for suggesting \nmisconduct in the assignment of the case to Judge Tapp .  \nRule 40.2 of the Claims Court ’s Rules requires that parties \nidentify related cases in their complaint, RCFC 40.2(a) (1)–\n(3), and instructs that “the clerk will assign the case to the \n \n4  Dr. Aljindi also claims to have filed, and cites to, \nother motions to disqualify other judges, but we decline to consider them as they are not relevant to the present case.  \nSee, e.g., Appellant’s Informal Br. at 6; Appx29, 31 –34; Ap-\npellant’s Informal Reply Br. at 2 –3. Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 11     Filed: 02/10/2025ALJINDI  v. US 12 \njudge to  whom the earliest -filed case is assigned,” RCFC \n40.2(a)(4)(A).  Dr. Aljindi identified the case resulting in \nJudge Tapp’s SBA Opinion ( Case No.  21-1578C ) as a re-\nlated case, Claims Court Compl. at 1 –2, and the clerk \nproperly assigned Judge Tapp to th e underlying  case here \npursuant t o Rule 40.2(a)(4)(A), Notice of Direct Assign-\nment .  See Appellant’s Informal Br. at 5 –7.  At bottom, Dr. \nAljindi has no basis for asserting bias or prejudice  except  \nhis own beliefs about Judge Tapp and Judge Tapp’s prior \ndismissal.  But “subjective beliefs about the judge’s impar-\ntiality are irrelevant” in the objective test required by 28 \nU.S.C. §  455(a), Allphin , 758 F.3d at 1344, and Judge \nTapp’s past judicial rulings alone do not constitute a valid \nbasis for recusal in this case, particularly as his opinions \ndo not display “favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible,” Liteky , 510 U.S. at 555; see Or-\nder at 1–2.  We thus affirm the Claims Court’s denial of Dr. \nAljindi’s recusal motion.  \nIII \nWe have considered Dr. Aljindi’s remaining arguments \nand find them unpersuasive.  We affirm the Claims Court’s \ndismissal of Dr. Aljindi’s complaint and denial of his mo-\ntion to disqualify.  \nAFFIRMED  Case: 24-1997      Document: 27     Page: 12     Filed: 02/10/2025",
