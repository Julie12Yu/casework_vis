    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, Eliza Taylor filed a class action lawsuit against ConverseNow Technologies, Inc. for allegedly violating the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) by using AI technology to intercept and record phone conversations without consent. ConverseNow is accused of processing phone orders via AI assistants in restaurants and using these conversations to improve its AI software, without notifying customers. The court denied ConverseNow’s motion to dismiss, determining that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged violations of CIPA.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether ConverseNow's use of AI to intercept and record customer phone calls without obtaining consent violates California Penal Code Sections 631 and 632, pertaining to unauthorized wiretapping and recording of confidential communications.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Taylor's allegations are sufficient to claim that ConverseNow intercepted communications without consent and considered it a third party under the capability approach since it uses these communications for its own software enhancement. Therefore, the motion to dismiss was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you call a pizza place to order a pizza and give them your credit card details, thinking you're just talking to the pizza shop. But actually, a company using a smart computer program is secretly listening in to help the pizza place handle calls. The customer wasn’t told about this, and the company was using the calls to make their computer program smarter. The judge said the company might have broken privacy rules by not telling people they were listening and recording these calls, so they're going to continue looking into this.",

No. 21  \n \n \nDefendant ConverseNow Technologies, Inc. has moved to dismiss plaintiff Eliza Taylor’s \nclass action  complaint.  Pursuant to Civil Local Rule 7 -1(b), the Court found this matter appropriate \nfor resolution without oral argument and vacated the hearing.  For the reasons set forth below, the \nCourt DENIES defendant’s motion . \n \nBACKGROUND  \nPlaintiff brings a putative class action against ConverseNow  for violating the California \nInvasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), Cal ifornia  Penal Code sections  631 and 632.  ConverseNow \nprovides a “software as a service” that allows restaurants to process customer phone calls using an \nartificial intelligence virtual assistant.  Dkt. No. 1 (“Compl.”) ¶¶  9, 18 -21.  ConverseNow operates \nacross more than a thousand stores in 43 states and  “processes millions of live conversations each \nmonth.”  Id. ¶¶ 9, 19. \nConverseNow ’s website  states that the “voice AI assistants automatically answer every call \nthat comes in and accurately records guest orders in real -time,” then send those orders to the \nrestaurant for preparation .  Id. ¶¶ 21,  29.  Live agents may listen in on the calls to “put the finishing Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 1 of 13 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  touches on complex orders when necessary” and to help the AI system learn how to handle similar \nfuture orders.  Id. ¶ 22.    \nBeyond providing benefits for its customers, plaintiff  alleges that ConverseNow itself \nbenefits from  the calls because, per ConverseNow ’s website, “by processing millions of live \nconversations each month, our self -learning system evolves even faster every day to improve the \nguest experience for new and existing partners alike.”  Id. ¶ 24.  Plaintiff  alleges that ConverseNow’s  \ncontinued sales and marketing success relies on this ability to improve its software.   Id. ¶¶ 27-28.  \nMoreover, the company’s privacy policy  states that  it uses the information to “improv[e] our \nordering platform, advertisements, products, and services.”  Id. ¶ 44. \nOne of ConverseNow’s partners is the pizza chain Domino’s.  Id. ¶ 32.  ConverseNow has \ntechnology “custom -tailored for Domino’s with quick and easy setup” that integrates directly with \nDomino’s data software and phone system .  Id. ¶¶ 32-33.  Plaintiff Taylor, an Oakland, California \nresident,  placed a delivery order at the Domino’s located in Delano, California, a location employing \nConverseNow’s voice AI technology.  Id. ¶ 6.  When Taylor called, an automated voice answered \nsaying , “Thank you for calling Domino’s. How can I help you today?”  Id.  Taylor placed her order \nand provided her name, address, and credit card information.  Id. ¶¶ 6 -7.  Taylor believed that \nDomino’s was the only other party on the call when she provided her “personal and confidential \ninformation.”  Id. ¶ 7.  Taylor did not know the call “was being intercepted in real time and \nwiretapped by Defendant  ConverseNow .”  Id. ¶ 6.  \nPlaintiff  alleges that w hen calling a store that uses ConverseNow’s technology, defendant \n“intercepts and redirects the call to its servers for recording.”  Id. ¶ 35.  “Within seconds, a virtual \nassistant introduces themselves using their ‘name’ stating they are an employee of the store location \nthe customer is calling and asks the customer what they would like to order today .”  Id. ¶ 36.  \nDefendant’s virtual assistant confirms the order and delivery address then takes the customer’s \npayment information.   Id. ¶¶ 36 -37.   \nTaylor alleges that t he caller is not informed that ConverseNow is a party to the call.  Id. \n¶ 38.  Restaurants  like Domino’s “fail to pursue or obtain prior consent, express or otherwise , from  \ncallers prior to  allowing Defendant  to record, examine, intercept, collect, and analyze the content of Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 2 of 13 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  customers’ conversations.”  Id. ¶ 41.  ConverseNow’s Terms and Conditions for restaurants \n“provides that the [restaurants] ‘may not represent or imply to others that [their] Customer Data is \nin any way provided, sponsored, or endorsed by ConverseNow.’”  Id. ¶ 42.  ConverseNow defines \n“Customer Data” as “any and all information and content that a user submits to, or uses with, the \nPlatform . . . .”  Id.   \nTaylor alleges that “[i]n sum, ConverseNow has the capability to use caller communications \nto (i) improve its own products and services; (ii) develop new ConverseNow products and services; \nand (iii) analyze customers’ communications to assist with avoiding the intervention of res taurant \nstaff in the order process.”  Id. ¶ 31.   \nPlaintiff filed this action on January 30, 2025.  See Compl.   ConverseNow filed a motion to \ndismiss pursuant to Fed eral Rule of Civil Procedure  12(b)(6)  on March 24, 2025.  Dkt. No. 21  \n(“Mot.”) .  The Court granted multiple stipulations for an extended briefing schedule.  Dkt. Nos. 17, \n30, 32.  Plaintiff opposed the motion on April 23, 2025, Dkt. No. 28  (“Opp’n”) , and defendant \nreplied on May 16, 2025 , Dkt. No. 33.  \n \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a district court must dismiss a complaint if \nit fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to \ndismiss, the plaintiff must allege “enough facts to state a claim  to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  This “facial plausibility” standard requires \nthe plaintiff to allege facts that add up to “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfull y.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678  (2009).  While courts do not require “heightened \nfact pleading of specifics,” a plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to “raise a right to relief above the \nspeculative level.”  Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555, 570.     \n In deciding whether the plaintiff has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted, the \ncourt must assume that the plaintiff’s allegations are true and must draw all reasonable inferences \nin the plaintiff’s favor.  See Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987).  \nHowever, the court is not required to accept as true “allegations that are merely conclusory, Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 3 of 13 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  In re Gilead Scis. Sec. Litig. , 536 F.3d \n1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2008).  \n If the Court dismisses the complaint, it must then decide whether to grant leave to amend. \nThe Ninth Circuit has “repeatedly held that a district court should grant leave to amend even if no \nrequest to amend the pleading was made, unless it determines tha t the pleading could not possibly \nbe cured by the allegation of other facts.”  Lopez v. Smith , 203 F.3d 1122, 1130 (9th Cir. 2000) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).   \n \nDISCUSSION  \nI. Section 631  \n California Penal Code section 631 creates four alternative avenues of liability for any person  \n[1] who, by means of any machine, instrument, or contrivance, or in \nany other manner, intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized \nconnection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, \ninductively, or otherwise, with any telegraph or telephone wire, lin e, \ncable, or instrument, including the wire, line, cable, or instrument of \nany internal telephonic communication system, or  \n[2] who willfully and without the consent of all parties to the \ncommunication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to \nread, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report, or \ncommunication while the same is in transit or passing over any wire, \nline, or cable, or is being sent from, or received at any place within \nthis state; or  \n[3] who uses, or attempts to use, in any manner, or for any purpose, \nor to communicate in any way, any information so obtained, or  \n[4] who aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or \npersons to unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any of the \nacts or things mentioned above in this section  . . . . \nCal. Pen. Code § 631(a) (subdivisions added for clarity); Javier v. Assurance IQ, LLC , 649 F. Supp. \n3d 891, 897 (N.D. Cal. 2023).   The third clause  requires proving a violation of the first or second \nclauses .   See In re Google Assistant Priv. Litig. , 457 F. Supp. 3d 797, 827 (N.D. Cal. 2020) .  \nOtherwise,  these clauses are independent bases for liability  and a section 631 claim survives if a \nplaintiff plausibly alleges a defendant committed any of the prohibited actions.   Here, plaintiff \nalleges violations of the first three clauses  of the statute.  Compl. ¶¶ 57 -72. Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 4 of 13 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   The parties dispute whether defendant  is a third party  subject to  the law  or a party to the \nconversation exempt from the law ; whether defendant  receives an independent benefit from its use \nof data; whether defendant  acted with the requisite intent; and whether defendant  “intercepted” \ncommunications in “real -time.”  See Mot. at 13 -19; Opp’n at 2 -10.  The Court considers each \nargument in turn.  \n \nA.       Third  Party Status and Use of Data  \nThe parties dispute whether defendant is a third party to the conversation between Domino’s \nand its customers because California exempts parties to a conversation from liability under section \n631.  Two California court opinions are widely cited to explain this distinction.  In Rogers v. Ulrich , \nthe defendant  recorded his conversation with the plaintiff  using a tape recorder jack, then later \nplayed the recording  for other individuals.   125 Cal. Rptr. 306, 307 (Ct. App. 1975) .  The court held \nthat the plainti ff could  not make a case under the statute because “[i]t is never a secret to one party \nto a conversation that the other party is listening to the conversation; only a third party can listen \nsecretly to a private conversation.”  Id. at 309.  In Ribas v. Clark , the defendant  surreptitiously  \nlistened to a telephone conversation between the plaintiff  and the plaintiff’s ex -wife at the ex-wife’s \nrequest.  696 P.2d 637, 639 ( Cal. 1985) .  The court held that the complaint established a prima facie \nviolation because the defendant  eavesdropped on the conversation and “a substantial distinction has \nbeen recognized between the secondhand repetition of the contents of a conversation and its \nsimultaneous dissemination to an unannounced second auditor, whether that auditor be a person o r \nmechanical device.”  Id. at 640 (citation omitted ). Thus, in considering claims under section  631, \ncourts must decide whether or not the defendant is a party to the conversation.  \nThe parties  recognize that courts have  split on approaching the third -party issue  between \nanalyzing whether a defendant is an “extension” of a third party or has the “capability” of using the \ncommunications for an independent  purpose .1  Opp’n at 2 ; Mot. at 14 .  The paradigm “extension” \ncase is  Graham v. Noom , Inc. et al. , where a co-defendant software company , FullStory, provided \n \n1 A third group of opinions focuses on whether the defendant service provider is simply a \nseparate legal entity.  See, e.g., Saleh v. Nike, Inc. , 562 F. Supp. 3d 503, 520 (C.D. Cal. 2021).  The \nCourt finds this approach less helpful.  Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 5 of 13 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Noom a “session replay” tool allowing Noom  to play back a recording of the plaintiffs’  “keystrokes, \nmouse clicks, and page scrolling”  when visiting Noom’s website.   533 F. Supp. 3d 823, 828 (N.D. \nCal. 2021).  The court held that FullStory was Noom’s extension —not a third party —because it is \na “vendor that provides a software service that captures its clients’ data, hosts it on FullStory’s \nservers, and allows the client to analyze their data . . . [and that] there are no allegations here that \nFullStory intercepted and used the da ta itself.”  Id. at 832.  The court considered FullStory’s tool to \nbe like the tape recorder used by the defendant in Rogers .  Id.  Citing Graham , defendant  here \ncontends that it is not a “third party,” but rather it is Domino’s “extension ” because it acts as a tool \nfor Domino’s business purposes.  Mot. at 13 -15.   \nThe capability approach is championed i n Javier  v. Assurance IQ, LLC , where the court \nfound that similar session replay software violated section 631 because the software provider had \nthe capability of using its recording for another purpose .  649 F. Supp. 3d 891, 900 (N.D. Cal. 2023) .  \nThe court rejected the extension approach because that approach interprets the statute’s second \nclause  “based on the intentions and usage of the prospective third party,” but that  “swallows the \nthird prong” that penalizes th e information’s usage.  Id.  The court further clarified  that “[t]he Ribas  \nCourt did not consider the wife’s friend’s intentions or the use to which they put the information \nthey obtained.”  Id.  The Ribas  Court instead “emphasized the privacy concerns at issue with having \nan ‘unannounced second auditor’ listening in on the call . . . .”  Id. (quoting Ribas , 696 P.2d  at 640 ).  \n“[A] growing number of district courts” have since agreed with this capability approach.  See Turner \nv. Nuance Commc ’ns, Inc. , 735 F. Supp. 3d 1169, 1184 (N.D. Cal. 2024) . \nThis Court agrees with the capability approach and finds sufficient allegations in the \ncomplaint to consider defendant a third party  under that approach.  Defendant’s website and privacy \npolicy explain that defendant uses information from the millions of calls it processes to “improv[e] \n[its] ordering platform, advertisements, products, and services.”  Id. ¶¶ 24, 27 -28, 44.  Defendant’s  \nVoice AI learns from each interaction and “continuously refines the underlying algorithms.”  Id. \n¶ 25.  Live agents working behind the scenes sometimes aid in this process.  Id. ¶¶ 22 -23.  Thus, \nunlike the plaintiff s in Graham , plaintiff here alleges that defendant provides a software service to \nits customers, and also uses the information collected to improve its own product .  See Graham , 533 Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 6 of 13 \n7 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  F. Supp. 3d at 832.  The software’s capabilities  thus go “beyond the ordinary function of a tape \nrecorder.”  Javier , 649 F. Supp. 3d at 900 (quoting Yoon v. Lululemon , 549 F. Supp. 3d 1073, 1081 \n(C.D. Cal. 2021)).  \nIn a more factually analogous case  than Graham , a court reached the same conclusion.  \nThere, a  plaintiff customer called  Capital One’s Customer Support Center and discussed the \nplaintiff’s banking information.  Gladstone v. Amazon Web Services, Inc. , 739 F. Supp. 3d 846, 850 \n(W.D. Wash. 2024).  Capital One used Amazon Connect, a service that “record[s] and analyze[s] \ncallers’ voice and conversations” before providing the data to its customers like Capital One.  Id. at \n849.  The plaintiff alleged that Amazon  Connect can use the information to improve its own services, \nquoting its Service Terms that said it can use the content of the communications for “ development \nand improvement of Amazon Connect ML Services ” and “ to develop and improve AWS and \naffiliate machine -learning and artificial intelligence technologies . . . .”  Id. at 849 -50.  The court \nheld that the plaintiff’s allegations were sufficient because they “demonstrate that [Amazon \nConnect] has capabilities beyond that of a mere tape recorder, and there is no evidence that [Amazon \nConnect] is incapable of using the dat a for any other purpose.”  Id. at 855.   \n Similarly, i n Yockey v. Salesforce, Inc. , the court held that the defendant’s chat software \nrendered it a third party to communications between customers and companies using the software, \nbecause the plaintiff had amended the complaint to add allegations detailing how the defendant  used \nthe communications to train its AI models and improve or develop its own products.  745 F. Supp. \n3d 945, 951 (N.D. Cal. 2024)  (Yockey II ).2  Other courts have recently reached similar conclusions.  \nSee Turner , 735 F. Supp. 3d at 1185  (holding that defendant’s use of AI voice recognition software \nto create a biometric voice print of a caller may use voice prints to improve its own product ); Tate \nv. VITAS Healthcare Corp. , 762 F. Supp. 3d 949, 95 6-57 (E.D. Cal. 2025)  (holding that software \nthat listens to a call and produces data about the call’s purpose and resolution could be used to \nimprove the product).  \n \n2 In an earlier order, the court had adopted the capability approach, but found the allegations \nin the operative complaint insufficient to establish “the capability to use these communications for \nany other purpose than furnishing them to Kaiser ,” a party to the chat.   Yockey v. Salesforce, Inc. , \n688 F. Supp. 3d 962, 973 (N.D. Cal. 2023)  (Yockey I ). Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 7 of 13 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   Beyond Graham , defendant cites several other cases in support of its argument that it is not \na third party, but these cases are inapposite.  Mot. at 13 -14 (citing Jones v. Tonal Sys. , No. 3:23 -cv-\n1267 -JES-BGS, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 178056, at *18 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2024) ; Cody v. Boscov’s , \n658 F. Supp. 3d 779, 782 (C.D. Cal. 2023) ; Byars v. Hot Topic, Inc. , 656 F. Supp. 3d 1051, 1066 -\n68 (C.D. Cal. 2023) ; Licea v. Am. Eagle Outfitters, Inc. , 659 F. Supp. 3d 1072, 1082 (C.D. Cal. \n2023) ).  Each case involve d the use of online chat software, but the courts found that plaintiffs had \nnot alleged that the software provider used the data from chats for any purpose other than to benefit \nits clients.  In another case, the allegations that a chat software owner harvested chat transcripts were \ntoo “generalized and vague” to support liability under the capability approach.  Cody v. Ring LLC , \n718 F. Supp. 3d 993, 1002 (N.D. Cal. 2024) ; see also  Williams v. What If Holdings, LLC , No. C 22 -\n03780 WHA, 2022 WL 17869275, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 22, 2022)  (holding a defendant not liable \nwhere there were no allegations that a software provider “a ffirmatively engages with that data in \nany way other than to store it ”).  By contrast, plaintiff here clearly alleges how ConverseNow uses \ncustomer phone calls to improve its AI product  and expand its business.  \n In sum, the Court adopts the capability approach and considers defendant to be a third party \nto the conversation between plaintiff and Domino’s  because it may use details from that \nconversation for its own purpose.3 \n \nB. Interception  \nThe second clause of section 631 requires that the defendant intercepts a communication \nwhen it is “in transit.”  Cal. Pen. Code § 631(a).  Defendant  contends that plaintiff  “must plead \nspecific facts explaining how the software works or how the interception actually occurs.”  Mot. at  \n16.  Defendant further argues that plaintiff’s allegations suggest it cannot intercept the \n \n3 The Court offers one note of clarification regarding the different clauses  of section 631.  \nUnder the capability approach, a party may be liable as a third party under the first or second clause  \nof section 631 —wiretapping or intercepting communications in transit without consent —if it has \nthe capability  to use the information it learns for an outside purpose.  A party is liable under the \nthird clause  if it violates one of the first two prongs and then actually  uses the information received \n“in any manner, or for any purpose.”   Cal. Pen. Code § 631(a);  Turner , 735 F. Supp. 3d at 1186 .   Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 8 of 13 \n9 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  communication because Domino’s routes the phone call to its servers, making it a party  to the \nconversation .  Id. at 17.  Neither argument persuades the Court that the complaint fails on this point.  \n To determine whether an interception has occurred, courts sometimes look at “cases \nanalyzing the Wiretap Act as informative of section 631(a).”  Licea , 659 F. Supp. 3d at 1084.  The \nNinth Circuit analyzed the Wiretap Act to determine that interception “with respect to wire \ncommunications” is “acquisition contemporaneous with transmission.”  Konop v. Hawaiian \nAirlines, Inc. , 302 F.3d 868, 878 (9th Cir. 2002).  \n Here, plaintiff ’s allegations establish how defendant  intercepts communications  in real -time.   \nPlaintiff believed she was calling Domino’s and an automated voice answered by saying “Thank \nyou for calling Domino’s.”  Compl. ¶ 6.  Plaintiff continued to believe Domino’s remained the other \nparty on the line, even when the call had been routed to defendant ’s AI voice assistants.  Id. ¶ 7-8.  \nWhen a customer states she wants to place an order, defendant’s AI assistant introduces themselves \n“within seconds.”  Id. ¶¶ 35 -36.  These allegations are sufficient to state a claim that defendant \nintercepts communications without consent in real time.  And defendant’s argument that it is a party \nto the conversation because the callers do not reach Domino’s is unavailing.  According to the \ncomplaint, the customers call Domino’s and think they are talking with Domino’s when the call has \nin fact been redirected by defendant.  \n Defendant’s cited case law does not convince the Court otherwise.  See Mot. at 16.  Many \nof the cases involve online chat communications , which present factually distinct circumstances.  \nSee Cody v. Lacoste , No. 8:23 -cv-00235 -SSS-DTBx, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135843, at *5 (C.D. \nCal. July 30, 2024) ; Ring LLC , 718 F. Supp. 3d at 1001; Esparza v. Gen. Digit. Inc. , No. cv23 -8223 -\nKK-AGRx, 2024 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28132, at *10 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 16, 2024) ; Swarts v. Home Depot , \nInc., 689 F. Supp. 3d 732, 746 (N.D. Cal . 2023) ; Valenzuela v. Keurig Green Mt., Inc. , 674 F. Supp. \n3d 751, 759 (C.D. Cal. 2023) .  Whether a third party pulls online chat communications into its own \nservers in real time is a different question than whether a voice AI software intercepts a phone \nconversation and directly engages with the caller.  \n In short, plaintiff has pled a plausible claim of interception in real time.  \n Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 9 of 13 \n10 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  C. Intention  \nSeparately, d efendant  contends that plaintiff ’s allegations are deficient and conclusory \nregarding defendant ’s intent to tap into or intercept communications.  Mot. at 19.  The first clause  \nof the statute requires a person to act “intentionally,” while the second clause  requires a person to \nact “willfully.”  Cal. Pen. Code § 631(a).  Under the federal Electronic Communications Privacy \nAct (ECPA), to act intentionally is to act “ purposefully and deliberately and not as a result of \naccident or mistake .”  United States v. Christensen , 828 F.3d 763, 774 (9th Cir. 2015).  “Intent under \nCIPA is determined consistently with intent under ECPA  . . . .”  Doe v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , 690 \nF. Supp. 3d 1064, 1079 (N.D. Cal. 2023) . \nPlaintiff argues that intent is not a required element, but plaintiff conflates the third -party \ncapability inquiry with the underlying illegal actions in the statute.  Plaintiff is correct that to prove \na defendant is a third party to a conversation —and therefore not exempted from coverage under \nRogers —a plaintiff need only show the capability to put the information to independent use, not an \nintent to do so.  But once a defendant is established as a third party, plaintiff must show that \ndefendant intended to intercept plaintiff’s communications, in this case her phone call to Domino’s.  \nContrary to defendant’s understanding of the complaint, plaintiff’s allegations plausibl y \nplead that ConverseNow intentionally intercepted and learned the contents of plaintiff’s phone order \nto Domino’s.  Plaintiff alleges that “[b]y virtue of its business, Defendant intended to wiretap \nPlaintiff and members of the Classes by contracting with businesses such as Domino’s to use its \ntechnology.”  Compl. ¶ 71.  ConverseNow “custom -tailored” its technology specifically for \nDomino’s existing software and phone systems.  Id. ¶ 32.  These allegations are sufficient to show \nthat defendant did not stumb le into recording the conversations by “ accident or mistake .”  See \nChristensen , 828 F.3d at 774; see also  Gladstone , 739 F. Supp. 3d  at 860 (holding the complaint \nsufficiently pled intent where the software in question “is designed for the purpose of recording and \nanalyzing communications between its customers (like Capital One) and consumers or other \nentities ”).   \n Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 10 of 13 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  D. Section 631 Liability Conclusion  \nDefendant’s collective arguments that plaintiff has failed to state a claim under section 631 \nmiss the mark.  The complaint plausibly alleges that defendant’s voice AI software violates at least \nthe second  clause of section 631.   The Court thus DENIES defendant’s motion to dismiss plaintiff’s \nclaim under section 631.  \n \nII. Section 632  \nCalifornia Penal Code section  632 creates criminal liability for  \nA person who, intentionally and without the consent of all parties to \na confidential communication, uses an electronic amplifying or \nrecording device to eavesdrop upon or record the confidential \ncommunication, whether the communication is carried on among the \nparties in the presence of one another or by means of a telegraph, \ntelephone, or other device, except a radio. . .  . \nCal. Penal Code § 632(a).   In relevant part, t he statute defines “confidential communication ” as  \nany communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably \nindicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined \nto the parties thereto, but exclud[ing]  a communication made . . . in \nany other circumstance in which the parties to the communication \nmay reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or \nrecorded.  \nId. § 632(c).   The California Supreme Court interpreted this language to mean “that a conversation \nis confidential under section 632 if a party to that conversation has an objectively reasonable \nexpectation that the conversation is not being overheard or recorded.”  Flanagan v. Flanagan , 41 \nP.3d 575, 576  (Cal. 2002) . \n Defendant  asserts that plaintiff had no objectively reasonable expectation that their phone \ncall to Domino’s would not be recorded.  Mot. at 19 -22.  Defendant flippantly suggests that “there \nis no privacy or confidentiality interest in pepperoni, sausage, or mushrooms.”  Id. at 22.  Defendant \nrelies on Swarts v. Home Depot , where the court found no expectation of confidentiality in an online \nchat with Home Depot representatives, distinguishing from a case involving a healthcare website \nand medical communications.  689 F. Supp. 3d at 747. \n Unsurprisingly, plaintiff focuses on the sharing of her name, address, and credit card \ninformation —not her pizza toppings.  Opp’n at 12.  Plaintiff draws support from Smith v. YETI Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 11 of 13 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Coolers, LLC , 754 F. Supp. 3d 933, 939 (N.D. Cal. 2024) , where a third party payment processor \ntook customers’ personal information and financial information and used it in a fraud prevention \ntool.  There, the court remarked that the confidentiality question is a “fact -intensive inquiry that is \noften too diffi cult to resolve at the pleadings stage.”  Id. at 943 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted).  The court concluded that “[P]laintiff has plausibly alleged that the sensitive financial \ninformati on being recorded is the type that could be reasonably considered confidential.”  Id.  In \nanother case, the plaintiff alleged that he shared credit card information with customer service \nrepresentatives over the phone without being told that the conversation was being recorded.  Bales \nv. Sierra Trading Post, Inc. , No. 13CV1894 JM KSC, 2013 WL 6244529, at *1 (S.D. Cal. Dec. 3, \n2013) .  The court there likewise concluded that disclosing “ personal financial information is \nsufficient to establish a confidential communication for purposes of § 632. ”  Id. at *3.    \n A review of the first amended complaint in Swarts indicates that this case falls closer to \nSmith  and Bales  than Swarts .  The content of the communications between plaintiff Swarts and \nHome Depot involved “ inquiries related to home improvement products he had purchased, whether \nthose products could be exchanged, and pending orders for products which were available for sale \non Defendant’s website .”  Swarts v. Home Depot , Case No. 4:23-cv-00995 -JST (N.D. Cal.), Dkt. \nNo. 17 (First Amended Complaint) ¶ 17.  Nowhere in the complaint did plaintiff allege sharing \npersonal financial information.  \n The Court agrees with the opinions in Smith and Bales  that alleging the sharing of personally \nidentifiable information and personal financial information is sufficient to allege a confidential \ncommunication took place, at least at the pleading stage.  The Court therefore DENIES defendant’s \nmotion to dismiss plaintiff’s claim under section 632.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons and for good cause shown, the Court hereby DENIES  defendant ’s \nmotion to dismiss.    \nThe Court re -sets the initial management conference to August 29, 2025, at 2:30 p.m.,  to \n/// Case 3:25-cv-00990-SI     Document 35     Filed 08/11/25     Page 12 of 13 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  be held over Zoom videoconference.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case concerns allegations against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, accused of collecting and mishandling user data, including biometric information, without consent, potentially violating U.S. privacy laws. The court approved a settlement agreement providing $92 million in monetary relief and extensive injunctive relief to prevent future privacy violations. The AI technology of TikTok, using machine learning to suggest content, is central to these privacy concerns.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether TikTok's data collection practices, including the use and sharing of personal and biometric information through its AI and ML systems, violated federal and state privacy laws and if the settlement agreement is fair and equitable to the affected class members.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court certified the class and subclass for settlement purposes, granting final approval of the $92 million settlement agreement, including injunctive relief, and approved the distribution of attorneys’ fees and service awards as determined.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have a favorite app that lets you create and watch fun videos. Some people thought the app company was secretly taking information about them, like where they are and even their face data, without asking first. These people argued that it wasn’t fair or legal. The court decided that the company would pay money to the people affected and promised to do a better job protecting everyone's privacy in the future. The court also made sure lawyers got paid for helping fix the problem.",

Lee  \n) Magistrate Judge Sunil R. Harjani  \n) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n Tens of millions of  Americans use the social media and entertainment \napplication now known as TikTok (“TikTok” or “the App,” formerly known as \n“Musical.ly ”) to view, create, and share short videos.   That is all well and good, but \naccording to the lead plaintiffs (“Plaintiffs”) in this mult idistrict litigation (“MDL”), \nthe App’s widespread popula rity comes  at the expense of its users’ privacy rights.  On \nbehalf of a putative class comprising all TikTok users in the United States  (an \nestimated  89 million people) and a subclass of Illinois use rs, Plaintiffs allege that  \nByteDance , Inc.  (the China -based company that created TikTok)  and its \nsubsidiaries —TikTok, Inc ., TikTok, Ltd., ByteDance Inc., and Beijing ByteDance \nTechnology Co., Ltd. (collectively, “Defendants”) —have used the App to \nsurreptitiously harvest and profit from  collecting  the private information of users in \nviolation of numerous  federal and state cons umer privacy laws.  \nLast year, t he Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary approval of a \nclass action settlement that would provide monetary relief to class members in the \nform of a $92 million settlement fund, as well as broad injunctive relief p rohibiting Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 1 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n \n Defendants from engaging in the alleged privacy violations going forward.

Ill.  2021 ), ECF No. \n161.  \nNow, after disseminating notice to the class and receiving approximately 1.4 \nmillion claims, Plaintiffs have filed a motion  for final approval of the settlement , as \nwell as  a motion for attorneys’ fees , expenses, and service awards.   Various objectors \nhave filed objections to both motions, as well as their own fee  and service award \npetitions.   For the following reasons, the Court  certifies the Nationwide Class and \nIllinois Subclass for purposes of the settlement , grants Plaintiffs’ motion for approval \nof the  settlement , approves  the fee and service award petitions to the extent stated \nbelow, and makes other rulings as applicable . \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \nI.

Background1 \nA. Factual and Early  Procedural History  \nThe App  is a social media and entertainment platform  that allows users to \nview, create , and share  short videos .  Using the App, individuals can  record videos  \nand overlay them with visual effects, background music , and other enhance ments.  \nSee Consol. Am. Class Action Compl. ¶¶ 127 –28 (“Compl.”) , ECF No. 114.  After \nrecording a video, a user can either save the video to their device or “post” the video \nto their TikTok account.  See id. ¶¶ 146–47. \nWhen a user posts a video  to their account , the video is shared with the user’s \n“followers” (that is, other users  who subscribe to see the user’s content) and also is \nposted publicly and displayed to users across the world using the App’s proprietary \ncontent -delivery algorithm .  Id. ¶¶ 2, 7 –9, 128.  The algorithm  uses artificial \nintelligence technologies and machine learning  to gather information about a user \nand to predict what types of videos the user would want to see .  Id. ¶¶ 8–9.  The App \nthen shows the user  a curated  feed of content  (and advertisements) based on  those \npredictions.2  Id. ¶ 141. \n \n \n1  The Court assumes familiarity with the facts of this case as stated in the Preliminary \nApproval Order .  See In re TikTok , 565 F. Supp. 3d at 1079 –83. \n  \n2  For example, if a user “likes” or comments on a video of a dog dancing to a popular \nsong, the App’s algorithm will “learn”  about the user’s preference for such videos and will \nadjust to show the user more videos involving dogs or other animals dancing to music on the \nuser’s video feed.   See Compl. ¶ 268 . \n Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 4 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n \n The simultaneous success and secrecy of TikTok’s proprietary AI technology \nhas prompted considerable backlash from privacy advocates, politicians, and the \nUnited States  government.  In February 2019, the  Federal Trade Commission  \nentered into a consent decree with several Defendants over the App’s purported \nviolations of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act  (“COPPA”) , 15 U.S.C. \n§ 6501 et seq.3  The Department of Defense expressed concerns that its employees’ \nuse of the App raised security issues  because of the App’s  “ability to convey location, \nimage and biometric data to its Chinese parent company .”  Compl. ¶ 6.  And several \nUnited States  Senators called on the i ntelligence community to investigate TikTok’s  \nalleged ties to the Chinese government and its potential as a “target of foreign \ninfluence campaigns like those carried out during the 2016 election on U nited States -\nbased social media platforms.”  Letter from Senator Charles E. Schumer and Senator \nTom Cotton to Joseph Maguire, Acting Director of National Intelligence (Nov. 27, \n2019) (on file with the U nited States  Senate) , https://www.democrats.senate.gov/  \nimo/media/doc/10232019%20TikTok%20Letter%20 -%20FINAL%20PDF.pdf . \nThese privacy concerns also prompted a wave of putative class action  lawsuits \nagainst TikTok  in federal courts across the country .  Beginning in 2018, several \nplaintiffs’ law firms began to investigate whether Defendants’ AI and machine \n \n \n3  Press Release, Video Social Networking App Musical.ly Agrees to Sett le FTC \nAllegations That It Violated Children’s Privacy Law , FTC (Feb. 27, 2019), \nhttps://www.ftc.gov/news -events/news/press -releases/2019/02/video -social -networking -app-\nmusically -agrees -settle -ftc-allegations -it-violated -childrens -privacy  (last accessed May 20, \n2022).  \n Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 5 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n \n learning technolog ies violate d United States  privacy laws.  The investigations focused \nin particular on whether the App’s video camera collect ed, retain ed, and distribute d \nApp users’ facial reco gnition information or other biometric information without the \nusers’ authorization .  See Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Approval Class Action Settlement  (“Mot. \nPrelim. Approval”) , Rhow Decl. ¶¶ 8 –10, ECF No. 122 -8.  The investigations also \nexplored whether the App harvest ed other types of private information, such as \ngeolocation data, video viewing histories, unpublished TikTok videos  (i.e., those not \n“saved” or “posted”) , and personal identifying information such as email addresses, \nsocial media account information, or cell phone data, and  whether Defendants  \ntransferred  that data to third parties.   Id.; see, e.g. , Compl. ¶¶ 155 –57.  \nThe first case against TikTok  based on these allegations  was filed in the \nNorthern Dis trict of California in November 2019.  See Hong v. ByteDance, Inc. , No. \n19 C 7792 (N.D. Cal.).   Other lawsuits  followed  in the Northern District of California, \nthe Central District of California, the Southern District of Illinois, and the Northern \nDistrict  of Illinois , including  one in this Court.  See E.R. v. TikTok, Inc. , No 20 C 2810 \n(N.D. Ill.).   Eventually, the burgeoning of litigation led the Judicial Panel on \nMultidistrict Litigation (“JPML”) to consolidate the then -nineteen related actions and \nto transfer them to this Court for pretrial proceedings on August 4, 2020.  See In re \nTikTok, Inc., Consumer Priv. Litig. , 481 F.  Supp. 3d 1331, 1332 (J.P.M.L. 2020); \nJPML Transfer Order, In re TikTok  (N.D. Ill. Aug. 12, 2020), ECF No. 2.  \nBy that point,  the political tensions surrounding TikTok had reached their \nzenith .  Just two days after the JPML’s transfer order, President Donal d Trump Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 6 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n \n issued an executive order declaring that TikTok’s continued operation in the United \nStates presented “a national emergency” that “threaten [ed] the national security, \nforeign policy, and economy of the United States .”  Exec. Order No. 13,942, 85 FED. \nREG. 48,637 (Aug. 6, 2020).  According to the executive order , immediate action was \nnecessary because TikTok’s “data collection threaten [ed] to allow the Chinese \nCommunist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information.”  Id.  \nThe order gave ByteDance an ultimatum: sell TikTok’s U nited States  operations to \nan American company within forty -five days or face a ban of the App in this country.  \nSee id.4  \nAfter the Trump Administration’s order, Defendants’ motivation to settle the \nnewly -consolidated cases  was at an all -time high given its need to shed TikTok’s \nliabilities in preparation for its anticipated sale.  See Pls.’ Mot. Final Approval Class \nAction S ettlement at 9 –10 (“Mot. Final Approval”), ECF No. 195 .  The attorneys in \nHong  had already engaged in months of comprehensive settlement discussions with \nDefendants, including a round of mediation in April 2020 led by Layn Phillips, a  \nprominent  retired fed eral judge .  Id. at 8.  To  that point , however,  the parties had not \nbeen successful.  Id.; see generally Mot. Prelim. Approval, Carroll Decl., ECF No. 122 -\n6 (discussing pre -MDL settlement negotiations) ; Rhow Decl . (same) . \n \n \n4  ByteDance initially agreed to sell its U nited States  operations of TikTok to Oracle and \nWalmart later in September 2020, but a final agreement never materialized, and the Biden \nAdministration ultimately abandoned the Trump Administration’s threat to ban the App.   \nSee, e.g. , Bobby Allyn, Biden Administration  Pauses Trump’s TikTok Ban, Backs Off Pressure \nto Sell App , NAT’L PUB. RADIO  (Feb. 10, 2021), https://www.npr.org/2021/02/10/966584204/   \n(last accessed May 20, 2022).  Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 7 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n \n On August 13, 2020 , Plaintiffs’  counsel in E.R., a case originally filed in this \nCourt,  was able to assemble a coalition of attorney representatives from the various \nconsolidated cases to attend a second round of mediation before Judge Phillips in \nhopes of achieving a global settlement.   Mot. Final Approval at 8–9; Carroll Decl. \n¶¶ 16–19.  That thirteen -hour sessio n proved fruitful  and concluded with a  \nsettlement  agreement in principle and a signed term sheet.  Mot. Final Approval  at \n10.  The parties memorialized the settlemen t in a signed agreement on September 4, \n2020.  Id. \n Meanwhile, a s part of its management of the MDL, the Court solicited \napplications from the attorneys who represent ed the various plaintiff classes in the \nMDL to serve as Lead Counsel and in other leadersh ip roles .  In September 2020, the \nCourt selected three attorneys —Katrina Carroll, Ekwan Rhow, and Elizabeth \nFegan —to serve as Co-Lead Counsel ; attorney Shannon Marie McNulty to serve as \nLiaison Counsel ; and five attorneys —Jonathan Jagher, Megan E. Jones, M ichael \nGervais, Amanda K. Klevorn, and Albert Y. Chang —to serve on the Plaintiffs’ \nExecutive Committee .  See Case Management Order No. 3, ECF No. 94 (appointing \ncounsel  to these roles ). \nThese attorneys worked with Defendants over the fall and winter of 2020 to \nassess the initial terms of settlement  and negotiate revised terms  to address the \nvarious concerns raised by different plaintiff groups.  As part of this process, \nPlaintiffs’ counse l also conducted a substantial amount of confirmatory discovery, \nwhich included interrogatories, document requests, and written depositions, and Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 8 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n \n arranged for a computer programming expert to inspect the App’s source code onsite .  \nSee In re TikTok , 565 F. S upp. 3d at 1080 –81.    \nB. Plaintiffs’ Claims  \nOne product of these efforts was  a consolidated amended class action complaint  \nfiled toward s the end of  2020.  The complaint proposes  two classes.  First, the \ncomplaint defines a Nationwide Class comprised of a ll United States residents who \nhad used the App prior to preliminary approval of the settlement.  Compl. ¶ 322.  \nSecond, the complaint seeks certification of an Illinois Subclass comprised of all \nIllinois residents who had used the App to create one or mor e videos prior to the \npreliminary approval of the settlement.  Id.  A brief summary of the classes’ claims \nfollows.  \n1.   Nationwide  Class Claims  \nOn behalf of the Nationwide Subclass , the complaint asserts  claims under \nfederal statutes, as well as claims under California statutes  and common law .  \nFirst, the complaint asserts for the Nationwide Class that Defendants have \nviolated the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (“CFAA”), 18 U.S.C. § 1030, and \nits Ca lifornia analogue, the Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act \n(“CCDAFA”), CAL. PENAL CODE § 502, by collecting personal information and data, \nincluding user or device identifiers, biometric information, and unpublished TikTok \nvideos, from App use rs’ cell phones without authorization.  Compl. ¶¶ 339 –41, 345 –\n46.   Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 9 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n \n Next, Plaintiffs bring a claim under the Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA”), \n18 U.S.C. § 2710, which creates a private cause of action against a “video tape service \nprovider who knowingly discloses, to any person” the “personally identifiable \ninformation” of its consumers.  Id. § 2710(b).  According to Plaintiffs, Defendants have \nviolated VPPA by knowingly disclosing App users’ personally identifiable \ninformation, including a record of the videos the user has watched, a record of the \nvideos the user has “liked ” or commented on, and the identities of the user’s followers, \nto Facebook and Google.  See Compl. ¶ 397.   \nAdditionally , Plaintiffs  assert that, in failing to disclose that they collect and \ndisseminate App users’ personal information, Defendants have viol ated two \nCalifornia consumer protection statutes5: the California Unfair Competition Law \n(“UCL”), CAL. BUS. & PROF. CODE § 17200 et seq ., which bans “unlawful, unfair, or \nfraudulent business act[s] or practice[s],” id., and the California False Advertisin g \nLaw (“FAL”), id. § 17500 et seq. , which prohibits any “unfair, deceptive, untrue, or \nmisleading advertising.”  Id.; see Compl. ¶¶ 372 –78, 381 –85.   \nPlaintiffs also assert  three claims under California constitutional and common \nlaw.  First, they argue that Defendants’ collection and dissemination of their private \ninformation  violates the right to privacy enshrined in article I of the California \nConstitution.  See CAL. CONST . art. I § 1 ; Compl. ¶¶ 351 –53.  Second, Plaintiffs raise  \n \n \n5 Plaintiffs also assert claims pursuant to several other state consumer protection \nstatutes on behalf of a “Multi -State Consumer Protection Class,” “in the alternative” to a \nNationwide Class.  Id. ¶ 419; see id.  ¶ 322 n.167 (listing states with consumer fra ud laws that \nmay apply to Defendants’ conduct ). Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 10 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n \n a claim based on the  common law tort of intrusion upon seclusion , arguing that the \ncollection of App users’ personal information constitutes an  “intentional interference \nwith [ their ] interest in so litude or seclusion . . . of a kind that would be highly \noffensive to a reasonable man.”  RESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS § 652B cmt. a ( AM. \nLAW INST. 1977) (updated Oct. 2021) ; see Compl. ¶ 363.  \nLastly , Plaintiffs seek r ecovery under a theory of unjust enri chment , \ncontending that Defendants derived revenues and profits from the dissemination and \ntransfer of App users’ private and personal information.  Compl. ¶ 387 ; see \nRESTATEMENT (THIRD ) OF RESTITUTION AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT § 1 cmt. a ( AM. LAW \nINST. 2011)  (recovery under the doctrine of unjust enrichment is appropriate when \nthe defendant “recei[ves] a benefit whose retention without payment would result in \nthe unjust enrichment of the defendant at the expense of the claimant”).   \n2.   Illinois Subclass Claims  \n  The Illinois Subclass  asserts claims  under the Illinois Biometric Information \nPrivacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/1 et seq. , which “embodies a fundamental \npolicy of the state of Illinois. . . . of protecting its citizens’ right to privacy  in their \npersonal biometric data,” and in particular, its “concerns about the use of new \ntechnology by ‘[m]ajor national corporations’ to collect personal biometric data.”  In \nre Facebook Biometric Info. Priv. Litig. , 185 F. Supp. 3d 1155, 1169 (N.D. Cal.  2016) \n(“In re Facebook ”) (quoting 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/5(b)).  In short , BIPA requires a \nprivate entity that collects biometric information  (defined as “any information . . . \nbased on an individual’s . . . retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 11 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n \n or face geometry,” 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/10 ) to “inform the subject or ‘the subject’s \nlegally authorized representative’ in writing about several things, such as the \npurpose of collecting the data and how long they will be kept, and obtai n the consent \nof the subject or authorized representative.”  Miller v. Sw. Airlines Co. , 926 F.3d 898, \n900 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting § 14/15(b)).   \nBIPA also prohibits sales and limits transfers of biometric information and \nrequires custodians to establish protocols for retaining the information and protecting \nit from disclosure.  See id.  at 901 (citing § 14/15(a) –(e)).  Successful BIPA plaintiffs \nmay recover either actual damages or liquidated damages —$1,000 for negligent \nviolations and $5,000 for intention al or reckless violations —plus attorneys ’ fees, \ncosts, and injunctive relief.  See § 14/20.  \n  Here, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants have violated BIPA by harvesting App \nusers’ facial scans without obtaining their consent, and by transferring and selling \nusers’ biometric information to third parties.  Compl. ¶¶ 408 –10.  Plaintiffs also allege \nthat Defendants routinely violate BIPA’s disclosure and retention requirements.  Id. \n¶¶ 411 –15. \nC. Proposed Settlement Agreement  \nIn exchange for a release of all  of the se claims , and any potential claims based \non Defendants’ collection or handling of App users’ data,6 the Settlement Agreement \n \n \n6  More specifically, the release covers “any and all claims, complaints, actions, \nproceedings, or remedies of any kind . . . arising from or related to the Civil Actions or the \ncollection and use of any user  data, including biometric data . . . arising from the beginning \n Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 12 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n \n provides for monetary relief in the form of a $92 million settlement fund and a range \nof injunctive remedies to prevent De fendants from engaging in the alleged privacy \nviolations in the future.  \n1.   Monetary Relief  \nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Defendants have agreed to pay $92 \nmillion into an escrow account, to be distributed among class members according to \na Court -approved plan of allocation.  See Mot. Prelim. Approval Ex. C, Proposed Plan \nof Allocation, ECF No. 122 -3.  The plan provides that the settlement funds are to be \npaid out in the following descending order: (1) payment of expenses incurred in \nconnection with a dministering the settlement; (2) taxes associated with the \nsettlement; (3) attorneys’ fees, service fees, and other fee awards; and (4) payment to \nclass members who submitted valid claims.  Settlement Agreement § 5.2.  \nOnce administration costs, taxes, and fees are distributed, the remainder of \nthe settlement fund will be divided into prorated shares “that are equal to the sum of \n(1) the total number of valid claims submitted by Nationwide Class members and \n(2) the total number of valid claims sub mitted by Illinois Subclass members \nmultiplied by five.”  Mot. Final Approval at 14.  Each Nationwide Class member who \nsubmitted a valid claim will receive one prorated share, and each Illinois Subclass \nmember  who submitted a valid claim  will receive six p rorated shares —one as a \n \n \nof time” to the date that the final approval of the settlement is either affirmed on appeal or \nthe date that the time to appeal the final approval order has expired .  See Mot. Prelim. \nApprova l Ex. A, Proposed Settlement Agreement and Release § 2.30 (“Settlement \nAgreement”), ECF No. 122 -1.; id. § 2.12.

Based on Plaintiffs’ estimates,  each Nationwide Class claimant  will receive $ 27.19 \nand each Illinois Subclass claimant  will receive $ 163.13 in monetary relief from the \nsettlement.  See id. ; Platt Decl. ¶ 43 , ECF No. 196 . \n2.   Injunctive Relief   \nThe Settlement Agreement also contains expansive injunctive remedies.   As \npart of the settlement, Defendants have agreed to refrain, and upon approval of the \nsettlement will be enjoined, from engaging the following conduct, unless disclosed \nexpressly in TikTok’s Privacy Policy: (1) using the App to collect or store a user’s7 \nbiometric information; (2) using the App to collect geolocation or GPS data; (3) us ing \nthe App to collect information in users’ clipboards;8 (4) using the App to transmit user \ndata outside of the United States ; (5) storing user data in databases outside  of the \nUnited States ; and (6) uploading content generated by users to the App’s servers \nbefore the user saves or publishes it.  Settlement Agreement §§ 6.1 –6.2; see generally \nid. at Addendum  § 4.   \nDefendants also pledge to create, at their own expense, a  comprehensive data \nprivacy training and compliance program for all newly hired employees and \ncontractors and to institute annual privacy training for all employees.  Id. § 6.3.  And \n \n \n7  All references to “a user” or “users” in the Settlement Agreement refer to a United \nStates user or users.   \n \n8  A phone’s “clipboard” is the function that allows the user to store text, images, and \nvideos for the purpose of copying and pasting them within an app or between apps.   See \nCompl. ¶¶ 181 –85.  Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 14 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n \n Defendants have agreed to pay for a third  party  to monitor this training for three \nyears and to provide written verification of the review.  Id. at Addendum § 4.3.  \nD. Order Granting Preliminary Approval  \nOn February 25, 2021, Plaintiffs presented the Settlement Agreement , the \nplan of allocation, and a proposed notice plan to this Court for preliminary approval. \nSee Mot. Prelim. Approval.   Three objections  to the preliminary approval motion  were \nfiled: one by Mark S., ECF No. 126 ; one by Dennis Litteken, ECF No. 132 ; and one by  \nBrian Behnken and Joshua Duga s, ECF No. 142.  \nAfter the parties submitted supplemental briefs regarding  the adequacy of \nrepresentation of minor class members,  the possibility of  in-App notice, and the \nprocess by which Plaintiffs valued the claims, the Cou rt granted Plaintiffs’ motion for \npreliminary approval on September 30, 2021.  See generally In re TikTok , 565 F. \nSupp. 3d 1076 ; Order Granting Prelim. Approval Class Action Settlement, In re \nTikTok  (N.D. Ill. Oct. 1, 2021) (setting forth procedures for no tice, filing claims and \nobjections, and the final approval process)  (“10/1/21 Order”) , ECF No. 162.  \nThe Court made three principal  findings  at the preliminary approval stage .  \nFirst, it found that it “[would] likely be able to certify” the proposed classes for \npurposes of approving the settlement.   In re TikTok , 565 F. Supp. 3d at 1087 ; see FED. \nR. CIV. P. 23(e)(1)(B)(ii).  Second, the Court found  that the proposed settlement was \n“within the range of fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy” in light o f numerous \nfactors, including the strength of Plaintiffs’ case, the complexity of potential ongoing  \nlitigation, the amount of opposition to the settlement , and the reaction from class Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 15 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n \n members.  In re TikTok , 565 F. Supp. 3d at 1087  (citing Wong v. Accretiv e Health, \nInc., 773 F.3d 859, 863 (7th Cir. 2014) (listing certain factors to be considered)).   \nFinally, the Court approved the proposed notice plan because it provided the best \nnotice practicable to all class members, with the caveat that Defendants were \nrequired to provide in -App notice of the settlement to American users.  Id. at 1091 –\n92; see id. at 1094 . \nIn making these findings, the Court overruled three objections to preliminary \napproval.  The Court first overruled Litteken’s objections that the Settl ement \nAgreement undervalue d Plaintiffs’ claims .   In doing so, the Court  noted that In re \nFacebook , the case Litteken cited to support his contention that the settlement \nundervalued the BIPA claims , was “a poor comparator”  because Defendants, unlike \nFacebook, do not concede that they use facial recognition technology to harvest App \nusers’ biometric information.  See id.  at 1090 (citing In re Facebook , No. 15-cv-3747 –\nJD, 2018 WL 2197546, at *2 (N.D. Cal. May 14, 2018)).  \nThe C ourt also rejected Mark S.’s argument that the settlement did not account \nfor conflicts between minor and non -minor class members.  It found Mark S.’s \ncontention that minor class members should receive more  compensation because they \ncould potentially  disaf firm the arbitration agreements  in the App’s terms of service \nunpersuasive,  because disaffirmance would likely  “require individual minor class \nmembers, at the very least, to stop using the App ,” which seems improbable.  Id. at \n1085 –86. Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 16 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>17 \n \n Additionally, t he Co urt rejected Mark S.’s argument that the Court should \nhave denied preliminary approval because Plaintiffs had not undertaken a detailed \nquantitative analysis of the net expected value of continued litigation to the class .  \nInstead, the Court found  that the re were “other reliable indicators” —including the \nhard -fought negotiation process, two rounds of arbitration supervised by a former \nfederal judge, and substantial confirmatory discovery —that supported a finding of \nreasonableness.  Id. at 1087  (quoting Kaufman v. Am. Exp . Travel Related Servs. Co. , \n877 F.3d 276, 285 (7th Cir. 2017)); see id.  at 1088 –89. \nFinally, the Court overruled Behnken and Dugas’s objection to the opt -out \nprocedure.  Behnken and Dugas argued that the notice plan’s requireme nt that class \nmembers who desire to opt -out of the settlement complete, sign, and mail individual \nopt-out request forms to Plaintiffs’ counsel violated their due process rights.  Id. at \n1092.  But as the Court noted, the requirement that class members indi vidually fill \nout and mail an opt -out request form is “a common and practical requirement” that \nis “consistently enforced” in MDL settlements .  Id. at 1093 (quoting In re Deepwater \nHorizon , 819 F.3d 190, 197 (5th Cir. 2016)); see id.  (collecting cases) .  Accordingly, the \nCourt concluded that the opt -out procedure did not violate due process.  \nE. The Notice Program and Claims  Submission  Period  \n1.   Notice  Program  \nAfter the Court granted preliminary approval, Plaintiffs disseminated  notice \nto the class through a notice program  developed by the settlement administrator, \nAngeion  Group  (“Angeion”) .  Mot . Final Approval at 18; see generally  Platt Decl .  Per Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 17 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>75 \n \n  Loevy claims that, were it not for Mark S.’s  efforts to carve out the claims of \nclass members  under the age of thirteen (“under -13 class members”) in this action  \nfrom the release i n T.K., no under -13 class members  would have been able to \nparticipate in th is settlement .  As a result, Loevy  contends , Mark S.  added at least \n$6,256,000 —the prorated share of the common fund that is attributable to under -13 \nclass members —in value to the settlement  and requests twenty -five percent of that \nnumber, or $1,564,000, in fees .  \n The proposition  that Mark S . is responsibl e for the ability of under -13 class \nmembers to participate in this settlement is without merit .  As the T.K. court \nrecognized  in denying Loevy ’s fee petition based on nearly identical arguments  there , \nin as early as the fall of 2020 , Plaintiffs and Defenda nts had “‘expressly negotiated \nthe right of class members  in the T.K. settlement class . . . to participate in the MDL \nsettlement class’” in order to “eliminate any potential impact” of the T.K. settlement \non this case, all without any input from Mark S.  Joint Status Report at 3  (N.D. Ill. \nOct. 30, 2020) , ECF No. 99; see T.K., 2022 WL 888943, at *27.   While those \nnegotiations were underway , Mark S. —far from working to preserve the rights of T.K. \nclass members to participate in this settlement —in fact was requesting  that the T.K. \ncourt enforce the T.K. preliminary injunction against class members in this case in \n \n \nthe Court sustain any of [his] objections.” Obj ector  Litteken’s Provisional Pet. Service Award \nat 4, ECF No. 193.  Because Litteken’s objections  to final approv al of the settlement  and to \nattorneys’ fees have been overruled in their entirety, they have not made a material \ndifference to the benefit of class members .  Accordingly, the Court will not entertain any such \nmotion.  Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 75 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>76 \n \n order to get the MDL reassigned to the T.K. docket.  See Notice of Filing Ex. A, \nObjector Mark S. ’s Mot. Enforcement Prelim. Inj. and Reassignment and \nConsol idation  Related TikTok  MDL, T.K., No. 19 C 7915 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 9, 2020), ECF \nNo. 59.  Given the considerable resources Mark S. expended in trying to unravel the \nsettlement , the Court finds Mark S.’s contention  that he was acting in the best \ninterests of the class es in this case  without merit . \nMark S. also argues that his counsel should receive a fee award  because he was \nthe first to propose the in -App notice .  While the Court is confident that the notice \nprogram would have satisfied the Rule 23 and due process requirements without the \nin-App notice, it nonetheless acknowledges that in -App notice conferred a material \nbenefit to the settlement class es.  And the Co urt finds that Loevy  does deserve some \ncompensation  for this contribution . \nThat being said, Loevy’s  fee request of $1,564,000 far exceeds that \ncontribution.  The Court similarly declines to award Loevy their reported lodestar  of \n$564,938.75 , because  Loevy’ s timesheets reveal that much of the work done in \nconnection with this MDL was devoted to undermining the settlement by attempting \nto enforce the T.K. preliminary injunctio n.  See In re Sw. Airlines , 898 F.3d at 745  \n(citing  Mirfaishi v. Fleet Mortg. Corp. , 551 F.3d 682, 687 –88 (7th Cir. 2008) (awarding \nobjectors a small percentage of their requested fees after balancing the “very slight \nimprovement” to the settlement against the objectors’ “lack of constructive activity in \nthe district court,” id. at 687, and the “detriment caused by their courtroom antics.” \nId. at 688)).  Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 76 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>77 \n \n Accordingly, the Court awards Loevy  $100,000 in fees.  Having reviewed \nLoevy’s timesheets, the Court finds that this award approximates the  percentage of \nLoevy’s time  that was devoted  to improving the notice program.  The Court will not \naward Loevy fees for any other work, because that work did not benefit  (and indeed, \nin many cases attempted  to harm)  the class.    \n4. Incentive and Service Awards  \nBecause a named plaintiff “is an essential ingredient of any class action,” Camp \nDrug Store , 897 F.3d at 834 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court may \nauthorize incentive awards “when necessary to induce individuals to become named \nrepresentatives.”  Douglas , 328 F.R.D. at 218 (quoting Synthroid I , 264 F.3d at 722). \n“To determine if an incentive award is warranted, a district court evaluates the \nactions the plaintiff has taken to protect the interests of the class, the degree to which \nthe class has benefitted  from those actions, and the amount of time and effort the \nplaintiff expended in pursuing the litigation.”   Camp Drug Store , 897 F.3d at 834 \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \n Class Counsel seek an incentive award of $2,500 for each of the t hirty -five \nnamed Plaintiffs.36  At the outset of the cases, t he thirty -five named Plaintiffs \nprovided Class Counsel with extensive details about their use of the App, including \nwhen they downloaded it, how frequently they used it, whether they made any vid eos, \n \n \n36  The named Plaintiffs are : Katherine Czajka; Misty Hong; Aparna Iyer; Brandy \nJohnson; Morgan  Kukovec ; Karina Quinteiro; and Meghan Smith; and minors A.S.  ex rel.  \nLaurel Slothower ; A.S. ex rel.  A.S.; A.R.; G.R.; C.W.; I.W.; P.S.; M.T.W.; N.T.; L.T.; S.P .; J.P.; \nK.P.; G.P.; L.M.; A.J .; E.R.; R.S.; J.S.; S.A.; L.B.; L.P.; M.P.; A.O.; H.S.; K.M.; C.H.; and D.M.  Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 77 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>78 \n \n whether their videos contain recordings of their faces, and whether they used any of \nthe App’s video editing features or facial filters in their videos.  See generally Compl. \n¶¶ 19 –98.  These disclosures of Plaintiffs’ personal and private information  \nsubstantially benefited the classes by validating Class Counsel’s legal theories and \nhelping them to understand the App’s technology.    \nThe named representatives also expended time and effort on the case after the \nsettlement agreement  was reached  by appro ving Class Counsel’s pleadings and \ncontinuing to assist in confirmatory discovery.   And the se efforts result ed in \nsubstantial benefi ted the class  as well .   \nLastly, empirical data indicates  that the requested incentive awards are \nmodest .  A study of approximately 1,200 class actions showed that the median \nincentive award per plaintiff was $5,250, over twice the amount Class Counsel \nrequests here.  5 RUBENSTEIN § 17:8  tbl.1.  Thus, t he Court finds the request of $2,500 \nper named Plaintiff to be reasonable  and appropriate . \n Mark S. and Litteken also seek service awards of $2,500 and $1,000, \nrespectively.  See In re Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n , 332 F.R.D. at 228 –29 (awarding \nservice awards to objectors).  For the reasons stated  above , the Co urt concludes that \nMark S.  benefit ted the class to some degree by advocating  for in -App notice , but not \nto the degree of the named Plaintiffs.  A ccordingly , the Court provides him with a \nservice award of $1,500 .   \nAs for Litteken, t he Court is not convince d that he deserves as much  credit for \nthe in -App notice, given that  Mark S.  was the first to raise the issue.  Nevertheless, Case: 1:20-cv-04699 Document #: 261 Filed: 07/28/22 Page 78 of 79 PageID #:<pageID>79 \n \n \nbecause Litteken’s insistence on in-App notice  impacted the Court’s assessment of the \ncosts and benefits of it, the Court finds that Litteken’s request for a $1,000 service \naward is appropriate, and it is granted . \nIII. Conclusion  \nFor the reasons stated above, the Court certifies the Nationwide Class and \nIllinois Subclass ; grants the motion for final approval of the  Settlement Agreement  \n[195] ; and grants the petitions for fees and service awards  [193][197][201]  to the \nextent stated above.   Additionally, the motion to accept opt -outs [207] is granted.   Co-\nLead Counsel is instructed to provide a proposed final order wi thin the next five days.  \n  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The case involves privacy claims against Flo Health, Meta Platforms, and Google, where plaintiffs allege that the Flo Period and Ovulation Tracker app unlawfully shared users' sensitive health data with Meta and Google, despite privacy assurances. The class certification was granted, for the most part, determining that common questions about the alleged AI-driven data sharing practices, informed consent, contractual limitations, and waiver unconscionability can be resolved on a class-wide basis. AI and automated systems are central in how the Flo app reportedly used SDKs to share menstrual and pregnancy data with Meta and Google for commercial gain.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Flo app users gave implied consent for their sensitive health data to be shared with third parties such as Meta and Google, and whether this data sharing breached privacy commitments.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court certified both a nationwide class and a California subclass, allowing class action claims for privacy violations, breach of contract, and invasion of privacy to proceed against Flo, with related claims against Meta and Google under California's Invasion of Privacy Act. The class action waiver in Flo's terms of service was found to be unconscionable and therefore unenforceable.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A group of people who used a period-tracking app sued the app company and two big tech companies because they shared private info about users’ health, like period dates, without telling the users. The court said these users can band together to sue because everyone was affected the same way. The court also decided that a rule in the app's user agreement saying users couldn’t sue as a group was not fair because it was hidden in the fine print. This means the lawsuit can continue as a class action, where lots of users work together to make their case against these companies.",

(Flo), Google LLC, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (Meta)1 in connection \nwith the Flo Period and Ovulation Tracker app for women (Flo App).  They say that, from 2016 to \n2019, the Flo App surreptitiously transmitted users’ highly personal information about \nmenstruation, ovulation, pregnancy goals, and the like to Google and Meta through their software -\ndevelopment kits (SDKs), despite assurances to the contrary by Flo.  See generally  Dkt. No. 64 \n(consolidated amended complaint or CAC).  Plaintiffs allege that defendants commercially \nexploited users’ sensitive health information, namely for marketing and advertising purposes.  \nId. ¶¶ 99, 105, 125, 128, 128 n.19, 141, 149, 182.   \nPlaintiffs filed a request to certify classes of Flo App users for damages and injunctive \nrelief.  Dkt. No. 477.  Defendants oppose d certification of any class .  Dkt. No. 491.  The \nsubmissions by both sides were massive  and totaled just under 1,000 pages in all.  Dkt. Nos. 477 -\n79, 490 -91, 496 -98.  The brief filed by defendants was not a triumph of clarity and organization.  \n \n1  The complaint names “Facebook, Inc.” as a defendant, but Meta is the current corporate name, \nwhich will be used here.

The Court has undertaken the arduous  work of bringing order to \nthe question of certification , which has resulted in an atypically long order.   \nOverall, p laintiffs have adduced substantial evidence demonstrating that the proposed class \nmembers saw the same privacy representations by Flo, experienced the same Flo App and SDK \npractices, and have the same alleged claims and injuries.  The questions posed in plaintiffs ’ case  \ncan be answered on the basis of common evidence that applies on a classwide  basis .  \nConsequently, c ertification is granted in main part , with a few specific, claim -related exceptions .   \nBACKGROUND  \nI. THE ALLEGATIONS  \nThe named plaintiffs are eight women  in the states of California, New Jersey, New York, \nOhio, and Pennsylvania , who downloaded and used the Flo App between 2017 and 2019.2  Dkt. \nNo. 64  ¶¶ 35-90.  The Flo App is said to have been  “the first mobile application to make use of \nartificial intelligence to accurately predict reproductive cycles” and was marketed as a sexual \nhealth and wellness app.  Id. ¶¶ 115 -21.  The app coache d users to input a wide variety of personal \ndata, such as the “timing of the user’s menstrual cycle,” “preferred birth control methods,” and \ndetails about users’ “sexual activity.”  Id. ¶¶ 131-33.  Plaintiffs sa id that f rom its launch to the end \nof December 2020, the Flo App was “rated the #1 period tracker in the United  States .  . . and the \n#1 most downloaded health app in the Apple App Store.”  Id. ¶ 121. \nPlaintiffs allege that, between 2017 and 2019, Flo made representations to users that it \nwould keep their personal information private and confidential.   Dkt. No. 64  ¶ 136.  For example , \nFlo’s 2017 -18 privacy policy stated that Flo “may share certain” information with third parties \n“that is reasonably necessary to perform their work ,” such as  “supply[ing] software applications, \nweb hosting, and other technologies ,” but would  “exclud[ e] information regarding your marked \ncycles, pregnancy, symptoms, notes and  other information that is entered by you and that you do \nnot elect to share.”  Id. ¶¶ 164-65 (first alteration in original).  Flo also represented that third \n \n2  Plaintiffs Wellman, Chen, and Gamino are residents of California.  Dkt. No.  64 ¶¶ 42, 56, 63 . Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 2 of 35 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  parties “could not use Flo App users’  personal  information ‘for any other purpose except to \nprovide services in connection with the App.’”  Id. ¶ 166.  Similar assurances were alleged  to have \nbeen made in the 2018 -19 privacy policy.  Id. ¶¶ 167-68, 177.   \nIn plaintiffs’ telling, these assurances were false.  They say Flo integrated Meta and \nGoogle’s SDKs into the Flo App to obtain personal information  shared by users.  Dkt. No. 64  \n¶ 140.  The SDKs collected two categories of information: “Standard Events” and “Custom \nEvents.”   Standard Events consist ed of “routine app functions, such as launching or closing the \napp,” while Custom Events were  “records of user -app interactions unique to the app itself.”  Id. \n¶ 137.  Flo design ed and name d the specific Custom Events used in the Flo App.  Id. ¶ 139.  The \nCustom Events  were  said to have convey ed personal  health information by virtue of Flo’s naming \nconventions  (e.g., Flo gave them titles such as “‘R_PREGNANCY_WEEK_CHOSEN’ rather than \nsomething generic, like ‘Event 1’”), and were  transmitted by the SDKs to Google and Meta.  Id. \n¶¶ 137, 140 -46.  Plaintiffs allege  that the SDKs transmitted “critical pieces of data from [users’] \nmobile devices, including ‘persistent identifiers,’” which were “unique data points .  . . that can \nlink one specific individual to all the apps on her device and her activity on those apps, allowing \nher to be tracked over time and across devices.”  Id. ¶ 151.  Plaintiffs say that, notwithstanding \nFlo’s representations  to users , Meta and Google used the collected d ata for commercial purposes \nbeyond providing analytics to Flo.  Id. ¶ 149.   \nII. THE LITIGATION  \nPlaintiff Frasco filed the original complaint in this case on behalf of herself and others \nsimilarly situated.  Dkt. No. 1.  The Court consolidated several related cases and subsequently \nappointed co-lead counsel for the putative class on an interim basis .  Dkt. Nos. 59, 80.  The \noperative complaint is the consolidate d amended  complaint, and it allege d claims against Flo, \nGoogle, Meta, and two other defendants, AppsFlyer, Inc. and Flurry, Inc.  Dkt. No. 64.  After the \nCourt dismissed the complaint  in part  with leave to amend, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their \nclaims against AppsFlyer.  Dkt. Nos. 158, 171.   \nAfter substantial discovery and motion practice, plaintiffs moved to certify four classes of \nFlo App users.  Dkt. No. 330.  The motion was terminated after the Court directed the parties to Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 3 of 35 \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  address the bloated number of expert witnesses proffered by the parties and the result ing plethora \nof motions to exclude those witnesses under Federal Rule of Evidence 702.  See Dkt. Nos. 330, \n381, 383, 385, 389, 392, 394, 395, 403, 419.  Google moved for summary judgment on the claims \nagainst it , Dkt. No. 338 , and t he Court granted summary judgment to Google for  plaintiffs’ UCL \nand aiding -and-abetting claims , but denied Google’s  request in all other respects.  Dkt. No. 485.  \nPlaintiffs have renewed their motion for class certification.3  Dkt. No. 477.  They now ask \nfor certification of a nationwide class and a California subclass , as follows:   \nNationwide Class :  All Flo App users who entered menstruation \nand/or pregnancy information into the Flo Health App between \nNovember 1, 2016, and February 28, 2019, inclusive.  \nCalifornia Subclass :  All Flo App users in California who entered \nmenstruation and/or pregnancy information into the Flo Health App \nwhile residing in California between November 1, 2016, and \nFebruary 28, 2019, inclusive.  \nThe nationwide class is proposed for  certification under Rule 23(b)(3) for damages against \ndefendant Flo  for: (1) violation of the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act \n(CMIA); (2)  breach of contract (or in the alternative breach of an implied contract); (3)  common \nlaw invasion of privacy (intrusion upon seclusion); and (4)  violation of the Compr ehensive \nComputer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA).  The same class is proposed for damages against \ndefendants Meta and Google  for violation s of CDAFA.   Certification of t he California subclass is \nalso proposed under Rule 23(b)(3) for damages against Flo  for invasion of privacy in violation of \nArt. 1, Sec.  1 of the California Constitution, and against Meta and Google  for violation s of the \nCalifornia Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA).  \nIn addition to the damages classes, plaintiffs propose certification  of the nationwide class \nand California subclass under Rule 23(b)(2).  The nationwide class would seek injunctive relief in \n \n3  Following the termination of all FRE 702 motions in connection with the first round of \ncertification briefing, Dkt. No. 419, the parties designated a more limited number of experts and \ndid not renew their FRE 702 challenges.  See Dkt. Nos. 425 -26.  There are consequently no \npending  FRE 702  challenges to any expert evidence proffered in connection with the present \ncertification request . Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 4 of 35 \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  connection with the  CDAFA and common law invasion of privacy claims, and the California \nsubclass would seek injunctive relief in connection with their CIPA claims.  \nThe three California plaintiffs (Wellman, Chen, and Gamino) are proposed to be the \nrepresentatives for the California subclass es.  Th e same  three plaintiffs , plus plaintiffs Frasco and \nMeigs , are proposed as the representatives for the nationwide classes.4 \nPlaintiffs and defendant Flurry ha ve settled .  Dkt. Nos. 503, 589 .  The Court recently \ngranted preliminar y approv al in principle  for the  classwide settlement  subject to further \nproceedings not germane here.  See Dkt. No. 597.  Consequently, Flurry will not be considered  for \ncertification purposes  here.   \nLEGAL STANDARDS  \nThe goal of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 is “to select the method best suited to \nadjudication of the controversy fairly and efficiently.”  Schneider v. YouTube, LLC , 674 F. Supp. \n3d 704, 715 (N.D. Cal. 2023) (citation omitted).  “The class action is ‘an exception to the usual \nrule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.’”  Comcast \nCorp. v. Behrend , 569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013) (citation omitted).   \n“To come within the exception, plaintiffs bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of \nthe evidence that the proposed classes satisfy all four requirements of Rule 23(a) and at least one \nof the subsections of Rule 23(b).”  In re Google Play Store Antitrust Litig. , No. 21 -md-02981 -JD, \n2022 WL 17252587, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2022).  The four requirements of Rule 23(a) are: \n“sufficiently numerous parties, common questions of law or fact, typicality of claims or defenses, \nand adequacy of representation. ”  In re Capacitors Antitrust Litig. , No. 17 -md-02801 -JD, 2018 \nWL 5980139 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 14, 2018) (quoting Comcast Corp. , 569 U.S. at 33).  For Rule 23(b),  \nplaintiffs seek to certify both (b)(2) and (b)(3) classes.  The classes seeking injunctive relief must \nshow that “the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally \nto the class .”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) .  The proposed damages classes must show that “questions \n \n4  Plaintiffs did not say why named plaintiffs Pietrzyk,  Ridgway, and Kiss are not seeking \nappointment as class representatives under Rule 23.  The Court construes this to mean that they \nremain in the case as class members only.  Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 5 of 35 \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of law or fact common to class members predominate” over individual issues and that “a class \naction is superior to other available methods” for adjudicating the dispute .  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(b)(3).  \nRule 23(a)(2)’s commonality requirement tasks the Court with “look[ing] for a common \ncontention ‘capable of classwide resolution -- which means that determination of its truth or falsity \nwill resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.’”  \nSchneider , 674 F. Supp. 3d at 716 (quoting Alcantar v. Hobart Serv. , 800 F.3d 1047, 1052 (9th \nCir. 2015)).  The class need not be totally uniform, but plaintiffs must demonstrate the “capacity \nof a class -wide proceeding to gene rate common answers  apt to drive the resolution of the \nlitigation.”  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes , 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011)  (emphasis in original)  \n(citation  omitted).  Rule 23(b)(3)’s predominance requirement is related to the commonality \nrequirement but is more demanding.  It asks “whether the common, aggregation -enabling, issues \nin the case are more prevalent or more important than the non -common, aggregati on-defeating, \nindividual issues.”  Schneider , 674 F. Supp. 3d at 716 (quoting Olean Wholesale Groc ery Coop., \nInc. v. Bumble Bee Foods LLC , 31 F.4th 651, 664 (9th Cir. 2022) (en banc)).   \n“If the defendant provides evidence that a valid defense -- affirmative or otherwise -- will \nbar recovery on some claims,” the Court must “determine, based on the particular facts of the case, \nwhether individualized questions will overwhelm common ones.’”  Van v. LLR, Inc. , 61 F.4th \n1053, 1067 (9th Cir. 2023) ( cleaned up ) (citations omitted).  “Each element of a claim need not be \nsusceptible to classwide proof,” Schneider , 674 F. Supp. 3d at 716 (citing Amgen Inc. v. Conn. \nRet. Plans and Trust Funds , 568 U. S. 455, 468 -69 (2013)), and the “important questions apt to \ndrive the resolution of the litigation are given more weight in the predominance analysis over \nindividualized questions which are of considerably less significance to the claims of the class .”  \nRuiz Torres v. Mercer Canyons Inc. , 835 F.3d 1125, 1134 (9th Cir. 2016).  Certification is \npermissible under Rule 23(b)(3) where “one or more of the central issues in the action are \ncommon to the class and can be said to predominate” even if “other important matters will have to \nbe tried separately, such as damages or some affirm ative defenses particular to some individual \nclass members.”  Tyson Foods, Inc. v. Bouaphakeo , 577 U.S. 442, 453 (2016)  (citation omitted) .

Even with a rigorous inquiry, “Rule 23 grants courts no license to \nengage in free -ranging merits inquiries at the  certification stage.”   Id. at 466 ; see also Google Play \nStore , 2022 WL 17252 587, at *4 ( “The class certification procedure is decidedly not an alternative \nform of summary judgment or an occasion to hold a mini -trial on the merits.” ).  “The decision of \nwhether to certify a class is entrusted to the sound discretion of the district court.”   Google Play \nStore , 2022 WL 172528 57, at *4  (citing Zinser v. Accufix Rsch. Inst., Inc. , 253 F.3d 1180, 1186 \n(9th Cir. 2001)).   \nDISCUSSION  \nI. THE EVIDENCE  \nThe salient inquiry  under Rule 23  is whether plaintiffs have adduced evidence that would \npermit the trier of fact to answer the liability and damages questions  for all class members  on the \nbasis of evidence common to the class as a whole .  The ensuing summary of plaintiffs’ evidence  \nsets the table for answering this inquiry , much of which is not materially in dispute.  \nPlaintiffs start with the representations in the Flo App’s privacy disclosures , namely  that \n(1) Flo “will never share your exact age or any data related to your health with any third parties ,” \nDkt. No. 477 -112 at 9925; (2) “your personal information will never be sold or rented out to third \nparties ,” Dkt. No. 477 -99 at 047 ; and (3) Flo “will not transmit any of your personal data [which \nincludes health data] to third parties, except if  it is required to provide the service to you .  . . unless \nwe have asked for your explicit consent ,” Dkt. No. 477 -110 at 978 ; see also Dkt. Nos. 477 -98-\n111.  These statements were made in more or less the same form to all Flo App users.  \nPlaintiffs also proffered evidence showing that the Flo App ask ed users to share  highly \npersonal reproductive and sexual information  within the app .  To illustrate , users were  asked to \n \n5  Citations to plaintiffs’ exhibits refer to the exhibit’s docket number and the last three digits of \nthe document’s internal Bates number for pagination.  Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 7 of 35 \n8 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  share whether they  “[d]idn’t have sex,” had “[p]rotected sex,” or had “[u]nprotected sex.”  Dkt. \nNo. 478 -7 at 828.  Users were  asked  to “[l]og symptoms,” like “ [c]ramps,” “[t]ender [b]reasts,” or \n“[a]cne,” and whether the user had taken any medications.  Dkt. No. 478 -6 (Egelman Rep.) ¶ 41 & \nFigure 8.  Users were  also asked  to log and track details  of their menstrual cycles , such as the \nconsistency of their “Vaginal Discharge,” with options like  “[s]ticky,” “[c]reamy,” or “[s]potting.”  \nDkt. No. 478 -7 at 827 -28; Egelman Rep. Figure 8.  The evidence shows that the app interface and \nprecise names of the inputs varied only marginally  over the class period, such as “Vaginal \nDischarge” versus “Log Fluid,” but the type  and substance  of information capable of being entered \nand tracked were consistent.  Compare  Dkt. No. 478 -7 at 827, with Egelman Rep. Figure 8.     \nPlaintiffs gave specific attention to the data all new Flo App users were required to share \nduring the app’s onboarding process.  They proffered  evidence establishing that a  new user was \nrequired to disclos e: (1) the user’s age; (2) a “goal” from one of three options : (i) “Track my \ncycle,” (ii)  “Get pregnant,” (iii) “Track pregnancy”; (3) the date of the last several menstrual \nperiods and the average length of the periods; and (4) if pregnant, by how many weeks .  See \ngenerally  Dkt. No. 478 -7; see also  478-8 at 891;  Egelman Rep. ¶¶ 40-41 & Figures 7 -8.  The \nevidence indicat es that Flo created and used Custom Events for the onboarding process with \nnames like : “SELECT_LAST_PERIOD_DATE,” “ AGE_ CHOSEN_PREGNANCY,” \n“PREGNANCY_WEEK_CHOSEN_UNKNOWN.”  See, e.g. , Egelman Rep. ¶¶ 60, 62 -63, 69 -72; \nDkt. Nos. 478 -8 at 891; 478 -15 at 738.  \nThe user entries for the Custom Events were sent to Meta and Google by means of their \nrespective SDKs.  See, e.g. , Egelman Rep. ¶¶  60, 62, 65,  81-84, 87 , 103, 105; Dkt. Nos. 478 -15 at \n738; 478 -16 at 380; 478 -17 at 147; 478 -18 at First Supp. Resp. to Interrogatory No. 9, Exh. C; \n478-21.  Neither Google nor Meta had any method of preventing  the SDKs from transmitting \nCustom Events that contain ed private health information.  See, e.g. , Dkt. Nos. 478 -14 at 244:12 -\n21; 478 -51 at 47:2 -19.     \n Plaintiffs presented  evidence showing that the Custom Events  featured  words like \n“pregnancy” and “period ,” which communicated information about the  dates on which a user \nmenstruated or became pregnant .

No. 478 -86 at 38.  Other evidence  indicated  that Flo used Google and Meta’s advertising \nservices to target users with advertisements based on whether the user was tracking her period or \ntrying to get pregnant.  See, e.g. , Dkt. Nos. 478 -55 at 510; 478 -56 at 855 -56; 478 -63 at 058; 478 -\n64; 478 -87 at 938.   Evidence shows t he Custom Events  data funneled to Google and Meta by their \nSDKs was used by both defendants to enhance their machine learning technologies.   See, e.g. , Dkt. \nNos. 478 -31 at Meta’s Resp. to Rog. No. 1 at 13; 478 -68 (Golbeck Rep.) at 20 -43; 478 -71 at 258 -\n59; 478 -66 at 114:2 -8; 478 -67 at 161 .   \n Plaintiffs  also proffered evidence that the user data entered during onboarding and \ntransmitted to Google and Meta was capable of being tied to or identified with a particular person.  \nThe evidence shows  that alongside the  Custom Events, Google and Meta’s SDKs collected  \n“unique” or “persistent” identifiers.  See, e.g. , Dkt. Nos.  477-38 at Resp. to Rog. No. 3; 478-26 at \n904; 478 -28 at 742; 478 -30 at 433.

RULE 23( a):  NUMEROSITY, TYPICALITY, & ADEQUACY  \nTurning to the Rule 23 factors, d efendants  did not bother to mention, let alone discuss, \nmost of the requirements for  certification required under Rule 23(a), namely numerosity, \ntypicality, and adequacy .  Even so, the Court  has conducted an independent analysis to determine \nwhether all the elements are satisfied.  \nThe record demonstrates that they  have been met .  To start, the proposed nationwide and \nCalifornia  classes will likely consist of millions of individuals, rendering “joinder of all members \n. . . impracticable.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1); see, e.g. , Dkt. No. 478 -4.  The record also establishes \nthat all plaintiffs and class members used the Flo App and were subject to the same app and SDK \npractices .  Consequently, t he proposed class representatives’  claims are typical of the class.   See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3);  Just Film, Inc. v. Buono , 847 F.3d 1108, 1116 (9th Cir. 2017) .  The sound \nperformance of plaintiffs’ counsel  during this complex litigation  demonstrates that  they are up to \nthe task of representing the class.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4).  There is no evidence that the \nnamed plaintiffs are inadequate  or are “situated so differently from the class” that they may be \n“subject to a conflict.”  In re Capacitors Antitrust Litig. , 2018 WL 5980139, at *10.   \nIII. RULE 23(a) (2) COMMONALITY AND  RULE 23(b)(3) PREDOMINANCE  \nIt is “appropriate to assess Rule 23(a)(2) commonality and Rule 23(b)(3) predominance \ntogether,” with a careful eye toward their differences as warranted.  In re Capacitors Antitrust \nLitig. , 2018 WL 59 80139, at *3.  The analysis is grounded in “the elements of the underlying \ncause [s] of action ,” which are discussed in greater detail below.   Klein v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , --- \nF. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 489871, at *8 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 13, 2025) (quoting Erica P. John Fund, \nInc. v. Halliburton Co. , 563 U.S. 804, 80 9 (2011)).   \nDefendants flagged four “global” concerns that they believe are grounds for denying \ncertification.  These are implied consent, a contractual limitations term, a class action waiver, and \nstanding, each of which is said to bar certification independently of the others.  The Court will Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 10 of 35 \n11 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  resolve these objections and then turn to the predominance and commonality analysis of each of \nplaintiffs’ legal claims . \nThe ensuing discussion uses the substantive law of California.  Plaintiffs proposed the use \nof California law because Flo’s terms of use state that California law  governs  and Google and \nMeta’s principal places of business are in California, such that decisions about SDK design and \nadvertising may reasonabl y be understood to have occurred there .  Dkt. No.  477 at 14; see, e.g. , \nDkt. Nos. 477 -121 at 573; 477 -122 at 584; see also  Clothesrigger, Inc. v. GTE Corp. , 191 Cal. \nApp. 3d 605, 612 -13 (1987).  Defendants did not oppose the use of California law  or propose an \nalternative .  They also did not object to using California law for a nationwide class or identify any \nconflicts  that such an application might pose with the laws of other states.   See In re H yundai and \nKia Fuel Econ. Litig. , 926 F.3d 539, 561 -62 (9th Cir. 2019); see also  Olean , 31 F.4th at 6 65-66.   \nA. Implied Consent  \nDefendants’ first objection to (b)(3) certification concerns user consent.  Defendants say \nusers impliedly consented to sharing their personal information “through their conduct when they \ncontinued to use the application [] despite exposure to materials that disclosed the challenged \npractices.”  Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 10 (citation omitted).  In defendants’ view, “it will be impossible to \nadjudicate implied consent on a classwide basis” because the “defense would be based on \nindiv idual, and subjective, interaction s of what certain class members knew, read, saw, or \nencountered.”  Id. at 10 -11 (citation omitted).   \nNot so.  Consent may be express or implied, but as the Court  concluded earlier in this case , \nit must be “actual.”  Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc. , No. 21 -cv-00757 -JD, 2024 WL 4280933, at *2 \n(N.D. Cal. Sept. 23, 2024).  “For consent to be actual, the disclosures must ‘explicitly notify’ users \nof the conduct at issue.”  Calhoun v. Google, LLC , 113 F.4th 1141, 1147 (9th Cir. 2024) (quoting \nIn re Google Inc. , No. 13 -md-02430 -LHK, 2013 WL 5423918, at *13 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 26, 2013)).  \nThe evidence of notice that must  be established before an individual may be deemed to have \nconsented is greater than that required to show she had inquiry notice.  Consent “is only effective \nif the person alleging harm consented ‘to the particular conduct, or to substantially the same Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 11 of 35 \n12 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  conduct’ and if the alleged tortfeasor did not exceed the scope of that consent.”  Flo Health , 2024 \nWL 4280933, at *2 ( quoting Calhoun , 113 F.4th at 1147 ).   \n Because defendants raise implied consent as an affirmative defense, they bear the burden \nof “invok[ing] individualized issues and provid[ing] sufficient evidence that the individualized \nissues bar recovery on at least some claims, thus raising the spect re of class -member -by-class -\nmember adjudication of the issue.”  Van, 61 F.4th at 1067.  To be sure, plaintiffs “retain the \nburden of showing that the proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23,” but the Court’s \npredominance analysis is limited to t he “defenses [a defendant] has actually advanced and for \nwhich it has presented evidence.”   True Health Chiro., Inc. v. McKesson Corp. , 896 F.3d 923, 931 \n(9th Cir. 2018).  Speculation about events or issues  for which a defendant has not offered evidence \nwill not do.  See, e.g. , Miles v. Kirkland’s Stores Inc. , 89 F.4th 1217, 1222 (9th Cir. 2024).   \nDefendants rely  on three buckets  of evidence as the ostensible proof  of consent .  The first \nbucket is press coverage involving a Wall Street Journal  article from February 22, 2019,  and other \nsubsequent news articles reporting on Flo’s alleged misconduct.  App’x 688 -705.8  Defendants \nmade no effort to demonstrate that a meaningful portion of the proposed classes might have seen \nor read these three specific articles with , for example,  evidence about the readership of the \nnewspapers or articles.  This shortfall is in distinct contrast to the presentation of such evidence in \nthe cases defendants cite.  See Brown v. Google, LLC , No. 20 -cv-3664 -YGR, 2022 WL 17961497, \nat *18 -19 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 12, 2022) (evidence about how frequently the sources of the asserted \ndisclosures were viewed and by whom); In re Google Inc. Gmail Litig. , No. 13 -md-02430 -LHK, \n2014 WL 1102660, at *17 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 18, 2014) (same).  Moreover, the earli est of the three \narticles was published less than a week before the end of the class period.  App’x 688.  \nConsequently , only class members who completed the onboarding process in that narrow \ntimeframe might be covered .  Such a tiny fraction of the class can be readily handled by the Court \nlater in the case, as circumstances warrant.  See Ruiz Torres , 835 F.3d at 1137.  Defendants have \n \n8  All citations to “App’x” refer to defendants’ Joint Appendix and use the appendix’s internal \npagination.  Dkt. Nos. 490 -3; 491 -1. Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 12 of 35 \n13 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  not demonstrated otherwise and did not contend that implied consent can be retroactive under \nCalifornia law to the start of the class period.   \nThe second bucket of evidence consists of privacy disclosures  by each of the defendants .  \nIn making this argument, d efendants c ame unacceptably close to misrepresentation.  They  say that  \n“Flo’s June 2016 privacy policy explained Flo ‘may share information, including [users’] \npersonally identifying information’ with third parties, ‘including .  . . Facebook,” Dkt. No. 490 -2 at \n8 (alteration in original) (quoting App’x 1510), but they omitted, presumably purposefully, \nadjacent statements that Flo would not “sell or rent any of your personal information to third \nparties” and that disclosures will be “to help provide, understand and improve our application.”  \nApp’x 1510.  Defendants also say  Flo’s “May 2018 privacy policy informed users that ‘[a]mong \nothers we may share your Personal Data with .  . . Facebook and Google,” Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 8 \n(alteration in original) (quoting App’x 1519 -20), but they again omitted adjacent language stating \nthat “[Flo] may share certain Personal Data , excluding information regarding your marked cycles, \npregnancy, symptoms, notes and other information that is entered by you and that you do not elect \nto share, with third party vendors who supply software applications, web hosting and other \ntechnologies for the App,” App’x 1519.  The omissions subvert anything of potential value in \ndefendants’ statements about the privacy disclosures and raise a troubling question of defendants’ \ncandor with the Court.   \nIt also bears mention that  the evidence of Flo’s privacy disclosures is common to the class .  \nThe common disclosures  will permit a jury to conclude in one fell swoop  whether a reasonable \nperson would have been on notice  of, and so could impliedly consent to, “the particular conduct, \nor to substantially the same conduct.”  Calhoun , 113 F.4th at 1147 (citation omitted).  The \nrelevance of Google and Meta’s privacy disclosures is not obvious in light of plaintiffs’ evidence \nof secret data sharing, but those dis closures, too, are subject to common proof.    \nDefendants ’ third  bucket  of evidence consists of publications and studies from outside the \nUnited States or before the class period  -- in some cases even before Flo was in business .  App’x \n708-11, 730 -32, 737 -43.  Defendants did not say how foreign  materials might reasonably have put \na Flo App user in the United States on notice of the challenged conduct, or establish  their consent Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 13 of 35 \n14 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  “to the particular conduct, or to substantially the same conduct.”  Calhoun , 113 F.4th at 1147 \n(citation omitted).  The same goes for the materials dating from before the class period or Flo’s \ncorporate existence .  More over, the record indicates that, well after the older  materials were \npublished, Flo  expressly  represented to  its users that it would “never share .  . . any data related to \nyour health with any third parties.”  Dkt. No. 477 -112 at 992.  It is a riddle how publications pre -\ndating these represen tations could  be a basis of subsequent notice or consent, especially in light of \nthe plain meaning of “never” in Flo’s statement .  And once again, defendants did not provide \nevidence of readership that might show that  a meaningful portion of the class saw any of these \npublications.   App’x 734 -35, 745 -47.   \nB. Contractual  Limitations Period  \nDefendants’ second overarching objection to (b)(3) certification concerns a contractual \nlimitations term.  Plaintiffs mark February 28, 2019 , as the end of the class period , and the original \ncomplaint was filed in January 2021.  Dkt. Nos. 1; 477 at 1.  Defendants say plaintiffs’ claims are \n“presumptively untimely” under a one-year deadline for filing a claim in the Flo App terms of \nservice.  Dkt. No.  490-2 at 7; App’x 1531, 1538.  Defendants add that plaintiffs’ tolling argument, \nbased on Flo’s alleged fraudulent concealment, poses an impediment to certification  because  \n“there is no way to figure out who knew what, and when, without a mini -trial for each Flo app \nuser.”  Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 7.   \nThe point is not well taken.  To start, defendants were unduly vague about which party \namong them  might permissibly assert the contractual  defense.  The  provision is in Flo’s terms of \nservice , but defendants suggest that Google and Meta might somehow benefit from it as well.  See \nDkt. No.  490-2 at 7.  Why that might be so was never explained, and nothing in the plain language \nof the one -year period in Flo’s terms of service indicates that it might apply to Google and Meta.  \nApp’x 1531 -39.  Defendants made a vague aside that “there are various other (short) statutory \nlimitations periods ,” Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 7 n.1 , but that too was not explained or developed into a \nmeaningful argument.  The Court declines to take up plaintiffs’ equally underdeveloped \nsuggestion, also buried in a footnote, that the limitatio ns provision is unenforceable.  Dkt. \nNo. 496-3 at 3 n.4.   Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 14 of 35 \n15 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  With respect to Flo, the one-year period in the terms of service is not a bar to certification.  \nAs a general rule, “the presence of individual issues of compliance with the statute of limitations” \ndoes not necessarily “defeat the predominance of the common questions.”  Cameron v. E.M . \nAdams & Co. , 547 F.2d 473, 478 (9th Cir. 1976 ).  That is particularly true when, as here, Flo’s \nrepresentations to each class member were the same, which permits the question of fraudulent \nconcealment to be answered on a clas swide basis.  See, e.g. , Dkt. Nos. 477 -111; 477 -112; 478 -7 at \n803; see also Bernson v. Browning -Ferris Indus. , 7 Cal. 4th 926, 931 (1994) ( under the principle \nof fraudulent concealment, a “ defendant ’s fraud in concealing a cause of action against him tolls \nthe applicable statute of limitations, but only for that period during which the claim is \nundiscovered by  plaintiff or until such time as plaintiff, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, \nshould have discovered it. ” (quotations and citation omitted) ).  \nThe question of whether and when putative class members might have had inquiry notice, \nsee Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 7 -10, is also amenable to a classwide answer of “yes” or “no” based on \ncommon proof.  The standard for inquiry notice under California law is an objective one.  See \nBrewer v. Remington , 46 Cal. App. 5th 14, 24 (2020).  The jury here will need only to look to the \nFlo App’s  privacy representations and the news articles that Flo believes provided notice to decide \nwhether a reasonable person was on inquiry notice of  the alleged  wrongdoing .9  See Jolly v. Eli \nLilly & Co. , 44 Cal. 3d 1103, 1110 -11 (1988); Brewer , 46 Cal. App. 5th at 24.  Assuming in Flo’s \nfavor purely for discussion that the hurdle of proving widespread readership has been crossed, t he \nanswer will be common to all users.  See Unruh -Haxton v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. , 162 Cal. App. \n4th 343, 364 (2008).10 \n \n9  Defendants cite the same news articles discussed in the implied consent section for the notice \ncontention.   \n \n10  Flo made a passing aside to the effect that the news reports it presented were only a few of the \n“many ways users could have learned about the challenged data -sharing practices.”  Dkt. \nNo. 490-2 at 1, 7.  T his comment again was not developed with evidence of what the other sources \nmight have been, and Flo’s vague conjecture is of no moment for certification purposes.  See True \nHealth , 896 F.3d at 932.  \n Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 15 of 35 \n16 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  In all other respects , the issue  of actual notice cannot do the work Flo asks of it.  “The \nexistence of a statute of limitations issue does not compel a finding that individual issues \npredominate over common ones” where there is “a sufficient nucleus of common questions.”  \nWilliams v. Sinclair , 529 F.2d 1383, 1388 (9th Cir. 1975); see Cameron , 547 F.2d at 478.  As \ndiscussed,  plaintiffs have established such a  nucleus .  Consequently, the Court cannot conclude \nthat the questions raised by the contractual limitations defense are “more prevalent or important” \nthan “the common, aggregation -enabling, issues in the case.”  Olean , 31 F.4th at 664.  \nC. Class Action Waiver  \nThe third overarching objection to certification concerns a waiver of class actions.  The Flo \nApp’s terms of service state that “[a]ll claims between the parties related to this Agreement will be \nlitigated individually and the parties will not consolidate or seek class treatment for any claim, \nunless previously agr eed to in writing by the parties.”11  App’x 1531, 1538.   \nPlaintiffs ’ challenge  to the waiver on grounds of unconscionability, Dkt. No. 496 -3 at 15 , \nis sustained.   “Under California law, a contract provision is unenforceable due to \nunconscionability only if it is both procedurally and substantively unconscionable.”  Shroyer v. \nNew Cingular Wireless Servs., Inc. , 498 F.3d 976, 981 (9th Cir. 2007).  Procedural \nunconscionability focuses on “oppression or surprise due to unequal bargaining power,” while \nsubstantive unconscionability is concerned with “overly harsh or one-sided results.”  Discover \nBank v. Superior Court , 36 Cal. 4th 148, 160 (2005) (cleaned up), abrogated on other grounds by \nAT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion , 563 U.S. 333 (2011).  Each  element  need not be present in \nequal degrees; “the more substantively oppressive the contract term, the less evidence of \nprocedural unconscionability is required .  . . and vice versa.”  Armendariz v. Found. Health \nPsychcare Servs., Inc. , 24 Cal. 4th 83, 114 (2000).  The basic “notion [is] that unconscionability \nrequires a substantial degree of unfairness beyond ‘a simple old -fashioned bad bargain .’”  \nSanchez v. Valencia Hold . Co., LLC , 61 Cal. 4th 899, 911 (2015) (emphasis in original) (citation \nomitted).   Although c lass action waivers are not categorically unconscionable in California , \n \n11  Google and Meta made no effort to say why this provision in Flo’s terms of service might apply \nto them.  The Court addresses the argument solely with respect to Flo.   Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 16 of 35 \n17 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  enforcement may be denied when they are “found in a consumer contract of adhesion in a setting \nin which disputes between the contracting parties predictably involve small amounts of damages, \nand when it is alleged that the party with the superior bargaining power has carried out a scheme \nto deli berately cheat large numbers of consumers out of individually small sums of money.”   \nDiscover Bank , 36 Cal. 4th at 162.   \nFlo says that Discover Bank  does not apply here and that the waiver should be enforced \nbecause the claims do not involve small sums of money.  Dkt. No.  490-2 at 25.  As Flo points out, \nplaintiffs seek thousands of dollars in statutory damages.   Id.   \nBut the California Court of Appeal has expressly concluded that Discover Bank  did not \n“hold that class action waivers are unconscionable only in the circumstances it described” and has \nfound such waivers unenforceable due to unconscionability even when the plaintiffs’ recovery \nwould not be insubstantial.  See, e.g. , Cohen v. DIRECTV, Inc. , 142 Cal. App. 4th 1442, 1451, \n1453 -55 (2006) (discussing cases); Indep. Ass’n of Mailbox Ctr. Owners, Inc. v. Superior Court , \n133 Cal. App. 4th 396, 404 n.4, 409 -10 (2005); see also Shroyer , 498 F.3d at 983 (“[T]here are \nmost certainly circumstances in which a class action waiver is unconscionable under California \nlaw despite the fact that all three parts of the Discover Bank  test are not satisfied.”).12   \nAs the Supreme Court  of California  has determined, the unconscionability analysis is \n“highly dependent on context.”  Sanchez , 61 Cal. 4th at 911.  The specific context of Flo’s conduct \nreveals a high degree of procedural unconscionability.  T he waiver is in a contract of adhesion  \nwhich was offered to users on a “take it or leave it” basis.  See, e.g. , Ronderos v. USF Reddaway, \nInc., 114 F.4th 1080, 1089 -90 (9th Cir. 2024).  It is presented  under the heading “Miscellaneous” \nas a single sentence at the end of  the terms of use .  See, e.g. , App’x 1531; Dkt. Nos. 447 -121 at \n573; 477 -122 at 585.

Flo does not seek to enforce an arbitration agreement, and Concepcion  did not \naffect general unconscionability principles outside of the arbitration context.  See Sonic -Calabasas \nA, Inc. v.

No. 490 -2 at 20 (citing Aguilera v. Pirelli Armstrong \nTire Corp. , 223 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir. 2000)), California law does not require a showing of “actual \ndamage” for a breach of contract claim.  R ecent rulings by the California Court of Appeal \nexpressly disagreed with Aguilera  and held that “California courts have applied section 3360 to \nconclude that ‘[a] plaintiff is entitled to recover nominal damages for the breach of a contract, \ndespite inability to show that actual damage was inflicted upon him.’”15  Elation Sys., Inc. v.

Pen. Code §§ 631 -32.  Section 631 \nprohibits the use, or attempted use, of “electronic means to ‘learn the contents or meaning’ of any \n‘communication’ ‘without consent’  or in an ‘unauthorized manner.’ ”  In re Facebook , 956 F.3d at \n607 (quoting Cal.

Pen. Code § 631(a) .  They state that most of the servers for the SDKs are located outside \nCalifornia and there is no classwide method of determining whether California resid ent users \ncompleted the onboarding process while they were in California.  Dkt. No. 490 -2 at 22 -23.  \nDefendants do not explain why this might be  relevant  to the §  632 claim  as nothing in the plain \ntext of that section suggests such a geographic limitation, but the point is well taken for plaintiffs’ \nclaim under §  631.   \nPlaintiffs say they have  evidence demonstrating that “Flo’s location data shows which \nusers were in California,” Dkt. No.  496-3 at 12,  but they fall short of showing which users \ncompleted the onboarding  process  in California.  The evidence consists of a few exhibits \ncontaining hundreds of lines of incomprehensible code , and a line or two reading something like \n“‘time_zone’:‘America/New_York .’”  Dkt. No. 478 -44 at 004 .  What this evidence might mean or \nhow it is germane to certification is  unexplained .  Consequently, it does not resolve the server \nlocation question in a reasonable manner for the putative class.  Plaintiffs make the passing \ncomment  that they have evidence that Google and Met a are “based in California , where they \ndesigned their SDKs and use the data intercepted through that technology.”  Dkt. No. 496 -3 at 12.  \nThat also does not answer the salient question.  T he case plaintiffs cite is inapposite  because the \ncomplaint there alleged the defendants “received the interception” in California and “intercepted Case 3:21-cv-00757-JD     Document 605     Filed 05/19/25     Page 32 of 35 \n33 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  Plaintiff’s and Class members’ communications and data with Favor, who is headquartered in \nCalifornia, in real time.”  Doe v.

There is no doubt th at a class action \nis the superior method of adjudicating  the users’ claims , compared to those millions of users  \nindividually suing the three remaining defendants.   \nThe record amply demonstrates discovery was complicated and voluminous, to say the \nleast, and defendants are represented by  law firms  with deep resources , all of which demonstrate \nthat litigating these claims entails  “relatively high costs.”  Just Film , 847 F.3d at 1123; see DZ \nReserve , 2022 WL 912890, at *9 (noting the “cost and other resources required to litigate against a \ncompany like Meta”).  Resolution of the common questions discussed in this order on a classwide \nbasis will promote efficiency by  (1) bypassing the need to relitigate identical questions and \nconduct nearly identical discovery in parallel litigations and (2) avoid ing the strain on scarce \njudicial resources that suits by individual Flo App users would impose.  See Just Film , 847 F.3d at \n1123 -24; Valentino v. Carter -Wallace, Inc. , 97 F.3d 1227, 1234 -35 (9th Cir. 1996).  Superiority is \nsatisfied.  \nV. RULE 23( b)(2) \nPlaintiffs ’ cursory request to certify  nationwide and California classes for injunctive relief \nunder Rule 23(b)(2) , Dkt. No. 477 at 24 -25, is denied .  A Rule 23(b)(2) class is “appropriate only \nwhere the primary relief sought is declaratory and injunctive .”  Zinser , 253 F.3d at 1195.  The \nfocus for most of the plaintiffs’  claims was on some sort of monetary relief,  and plaintiffs’ motion \npapers hardly gave the  proposed injunctive relief  classes any attention.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals dealt with a dispute regarding insurance coverage for alleged violations of Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by Wynndalco Enterprises, facilitated through the use of Clearview AI's facial recognition software. The court determined that the \"violation-of-statutes\" exclusion in Citizens Insurance's policy was ambiguous and thus, Citizens has a duty to defend Wynndalco against the BIPA-related lawsuits. The involvement of AI was significant as the case revolved around Clearview AI's collection and use of biometric data via facial-recognition technology, which was central to the BIPA violations.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the insurance policy's catch-all exclusion for violations of statutes unambiguously precludes coverage for BIPA claims, thereby relieving Citizens Insurance Company of its duty to defend Wynndalco.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Seventh Circuit held that the catch-all provision in the insurance policy's violation-of-statutes exclusion was ambiguous. Therefore, Citizens Insurance must provide a defense for Wynndalco in the lawsuits alleging BIPA violations and related common law claims.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you buy an insurance policy that promises to cover damages for hurting someone's privacy, like sharing their photos without permission. Now, when your company is sued for using an AI to collect people's photos from the internet without asking, your insurance tries to avoid covering it, saying it doesn't have to for laws about privacy. The court checks and says the insurance policy is too confusing about this part, so the insurance does have to help you with the lawsuit.",

The \nnarrowing construction that Citizens proposes to resolve that ambiguity is not supported by the language of the provision and does not, in fact, resolve the ambiguity.

Id. at 676. \nI. \nThe litigation that has given rise to this coverage dispute \nstems from a massive database of facial -image scans assem-\nbled by Clearview AI, an artificial intelligence firm that spe-cializes in facial recognition software. We accept as true the following factual allegations gleaned from the two com-plaints filed against Wynndalco.  \nClearview AI allegedly has extracted or “scraped” in  ex-\ncess of three billion photographs of individuals from online social media, content- sharing, and digital payment platforms \n(including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, Google Photos, LinkedIn, and Venmo); converted those images into biometric facial recognition identifiers us-ing proprietary algorithms; collected the original images and \ntheir biometric counterparts into its database; and paired \nthose images with information as to where those images were found on the Internet. Clearvi ew AI has also created a facial \nrecognition application or “app” that allows a user to identify an individual by uploading a photograph of that person to the app. The app then allows the user to see other photographs of Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 334 No. 22-2313 \nthat same person on the media platforms or websites where \nthey appear, along with the identifying information (includ-\ning their name, address, and other personal information) as-\nsociated with that individual. Thus, a user could take a pho-tograph of a stranger on the street and upload the image  to \nthe app, which converts the photograph into a biometric facial scan, and (assuming the individual’s photos and information are in Clearview AI’s database), determine who that person \nis, and access any number of additional photographs of and \nassociated content (tweets, Facebook and Instagram posts, \nYouTube and TikTok videos, LinkedIn profiles, etc.) created by and about that individual. Clearview AI marketed the app to law enforcement agencies, among others. See Kashmir Hill, \nThe Secretive Company That Might End Privacy As We Know It , \nN\nEW YORK TIMES  (Jan. 18, 2020), available at https://www.ny-\ntimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html? . \nThe Chicago Police Department, through its purchasing \nagent CDW -Government , gained access to the Clearview AI \ndatabase and its facial- identification app by means of a two-\nyear contract between CDW -Government  and Wynndalco.  \nMelissa Thornley and Mario Calderon are the respective \nlead, named plaintiffs in two putative class actions filed on behal f of themselves and other Illinois residents whose facial \nimages have been collected and scanned into the Clearview \nAI database: Thornley, et al. v. CDW -Government, LLC, et al. , \nNo. 2020 CH 04346 (Cir. Ct. Cook Cnty. filed May 27, 2020); \nCalderon, et al. v. Clearview AI, Inc., et al. , No. 1:20- cv-01296- CM \n(S.D.N.Y. filed Jul. 22, 2020). We shall refer to the two suits using their surnames.  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 5 \nWynndalco is an Illinois -based information technology \nservices and consulting firm. The Thornley  and Calderon  com-\nplain ts describe Wynndalco’s relationship with Clearview AI \nin two different ways. According to the Thornley  complaint, \nClearview AI was not able to sell access to its database and \napp directly to the Chicago Police Department because it was not an approved vendor for the department, whereas Wynndalco was an approved vender. Thus, CDW -\nGovernment  contacted Wynndalco and entered into an ar-\nrangement pursuant to which Wynndalco would purchase the product from Clearview AI and then re -sell it to CDW -\nGovernment . Wynndalco proceeded to make the purchase \nfrom Clearview AI in December 2019 for the sum of $47,500, and then immediately re -sold the product to CDW -\nGovernment  for $48,450.00. CDW -Government  in turn re -\nsold the product to the Chicago Police Department for  \n$49,875. By contrast, the Calderon  complaint alleges that \nWynndalco is Clearview AI’s agent and that Wynndalco li-censes and supplies the product to customers on Clearview \nAI’s behalf. The Calderon  complaint alleges that on January 1, \n2020, the Chicago Pol ice Department, through its agent, \nCDW -Government , entered into a two- year, $49,875 contract \nwith Clearview AI.  \nBoth suits allege that Wynndalco’s role in this transaction \nra\nn afoul of BIPA. Illinois became the first state in the nation \nto enact biometric data privacy legislation when it promul-\ngated BIPA. Broadly speaking, BIPA codifies an individual’s right of privacy in and control over his or her biometric iden-tifiers and biometric information. See  Bryant v. Compass Grp . \nUSA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, 621 (7th  Cir. 2020) (quoting Rosenbach \nv. Six Flags Entm ’t Corp. , 129 N.E.3d 1197, 1206 (Ill. 2019)). \n“[The Act] imposes numerous restrictions on how private Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 336 No. 22-2313 \nentities collect, retain, disclose and destroy biometric identifi-\ners, including retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, \nscans of hand or face geometry, or biometric information. Un-\nder the Act, any person ‘ aggrieved’ by a violation of its provi-\nsions ‘shall have a right of action  … against an offending \nparty’ and ‘may recover for each violation ’ the gre ater of liq-\nuidated damages or actual damages, reasonable attorney fees \nand costs, and any other relief, including an injunction, that \nthe court deems appropriate .” Rosenbach , 129 N.E.3d at 1199–\n1200 (quoting 740 ILCS 14/20). A violation of the statute as t o \none’s biometric information is sufficient in and of itself to ren-\nder an individual an “aggrieved person” entitled to pursue \nrelief; he or she need not suffer an actual injury as a result of \nthe violation.

The term “b iometric identifier” is  defined \nto include , among other attributes,  “face geometry .” 740 ILCS \n14/10. A second, unjust enrichment count in the Thornley  com-\nplaint alleges that Wynndalco has unjustly benefitted from its publication of the class members’ biometric information, to \nthe detriment of the named plaintiffs and the class. A third, \ninvasion -of-privacy count alleges that Wynndalco’s publica-\ntion and exploitation of the  plaintiff s’ biometric data \namounted to an unauthorized intrusion upon their seclusion, causing them mental anguish .\n3 \nThe first amended complaint in Calderon  includes a single \ncount against Wynndalco.4 It alleges that Wynndalco and its \n \n3 Wynndalco attempted to remove the Thornley  case to federal court, \nbut we affirmed the district court’s assessment that, given the nature of \nthe statutory violations alleged in that case, the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing to pursue relief in a federal forum, and the case was remanded to Illinois  state court.

That section provides:  \nNo private entity may collect, capture, purchase, re-\nceive through trade, or otherwise obtain a person's \nor a customer's biometric identifier or biometric in-\nformation, unless it first:  \n    (1) informs the subject or the subject's legally  \nauthorized representative in writing that a bio-metric identifier or biometric information is be-ing collected or stored;   \n    (2) informs the subject or the subject's legally  \nauthorized representative in writing of the spe-cific purpose and length of term for which a bi-ometric identifier or biometric information is being collected, stored, and used; and  \n    (3) receives a written release executed by the \nsubject of the biometric identifier or biometric information or the subject's legally au thorized \nrepresentative  \nAt the time of the sale of the Clearview AI app to the Chi-\ncago Police Department, Wynndalco had business owner’s in-surance coverage through a policy issued to it by Citizens ef-\nfective from October 2, 2019, to October 2, 2020. Secti on II of \n \nduring the five years immediately preceding the filing of the Calderon  \ncomplaint.  \n Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 9 \nthe policy sets forth the liability coverage for the business. \nSection II(A)(1) provides liability coverage for, among other \ninjuries, “personal and advertising injury,” R. 20 -1 at 83, \nwhich section II(F)(14) defines, in relevant part, as an “inju ry, \nincluding consequential ‘bodily injury,’ arising out of one or \nmore of the following offenses: … e. [o]ral or written publica-tion, in any manner, of material that violates a person’s right of privacy.” R. 20- 1 at 100. Citizens does not dispute that \nWynndalco’s  conduct, as alleged in the Thornley  and Calderon \ncomplaints , falls within the policy’s definition of “personal \nand advertising injury.”  But Citizens contends that coverage \nof the Thornley  and Calderon  claims  is barred by a catch -all \nprovision in a  policy exclusion  barring coverage for injuries \narising out of certain statutory violations . The exclusion in \nquestion provides as follows (with the catch -all provision \nhighlighted):  \nThis insurance does not apply to:  \n… \nq. Distribution of Material in Violation of \nStatutes  \n“Bodily injury,” “property damage” or “per-\nsonal and advertising injury” arising directly or \nindirectly out of any action or omission that vi-olates or is alleged to violate:  \n(1) The Telephone Consumer Protection Act \n(TCPA), including any amendment of or addi-tion to such law; or  \n(2) The CAN -SPAM Act of 2003, including \nany amendment or addition to such law; or  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 3310 No. 22-2313 \n(3) The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), \nand any amendment of or addition to such law, \nincluding the Fair and Accurate Credit Tra nsac-\ntion Act (FACTA); or  \n(4) Any other laws, statutes, ordinances, or reg-\nulations , that address, prohibit or limit the printing, \ndissemination, disposal, collecting, recording, send-\ning, transmitting, communicating or distribution of material or information . \nPolicy § II(B)(1)(q) ( bold emphasis in original; italicized em-\nphasis added) , R. 20- 1 at 91–92. Citizens contends that the in-\njury alleged by the plaintiffs in both the Thornley  and Calderon \ncomplaints  constitutes a “personal or advertising injury” that \narises, directly or indirectly, out of a violation of BIPA, which, \nin Citizens’ view, is a “law” or “statute” of the type referenced \nin the catch -all provision set forth in  ¶ 4 of the exclusion .\n5 \nAfter Wynndalco tendered the two complaints to Citizens \nand asked that it supply Wynndalco with a defense, Citizens filed this diversity action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)(1), \nseeking a declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 \nthat it has no duty to defend or indemnify Wynndalco (or its officers) in either the Thornley  or the Calderon  suit, invoking \nthe catch -all provision of the violation -of-statutes exclusion. \nWynndalco and its officers answered the complaint, denied the allegation that the injuries alleged in the Thornley  and Cal-\nderon  suits were not covered by the insurance policy, and filed \na counterclaim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, Count I of which \n \n5 The catch- all provision in the violation -of-statutes exclusion is the \nsole basis on which Citizens contends it has no duty to defend or indem-\nnify Wynndalco. See R. 20 at 8 ¶¶ 39 –41.  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 11 \nseeks a declaration that Citizens is, in fact, obligated to defend \nthem against the Calder on suit. R. 59 at 27–29. Count II of the \ncounterclaim alleged that Citizens had breached the insur-ance policy by refusing to provide a defense for the Thornley  \nsuit and the Calderon suit and seeks damages, including the \nattorney’s fees and costs Wynndalco has incurred in defend-ing against the two lawsuits. R. 59 at 29 –31. Citizens answered \nthe counterclaim and denied its allegations.  \nOn the parties’ cross -motions for judgment on the plead-\nings, the district court entered judgment for Wynndalco, con-cluding th at the catch -all is facially ambiguous  and therefore \nnot enforceable against Wynndalco. 595 F.Supp.3d 668. The court deemed it so because a literal reading of the expansive wording of that provision would preclude coverage not only \nfor violations of privacy- related statutes like BIPA, but a nu m-\nber of other statutory causes of action that the policy in the \nfirst instance purported to cover, including slander, libel, trademark, and copyright. Id. at 673–74. Given the ambiguity, \nthe court turned to two interpretive canons, ejusdem gen eris \nand noscitur a sociis to determine whether a narrower reading \nof the catch -all might be warranted based on the types of stat-\nutes cited in the exclusionary provisions immediately preced-ing the catch -all. But those canons, the court concluded, did \nnot resolve the ambiguity. In contrast to comparable policy language at issue in West Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Krishna Schaum-\nburg Tan, Inc. , 183 N.E.3d 47 (Ill. 2021), the catch- all could not \nreasonably be interpreted to reach only statutes regulating \nmethods of communication,  given that the statutes specifi-\ncally cited as excluded from coverage were not limited to those regulating communication, as they were in Krishna Tan . \nWynndalco , 595 F.Supp.3d at 674. Citizens proposed that the \nstatutes singled out by name in the exclusion  at issue here all Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 3312 No. 22-2313 \nregulate privacy, but the court pointed out that the cited stat-\nutes regulate different forms of privacy, so there is no true \ncommonality among them suggesting that the catch -all pro-\nvision should be read to reach only injuries resulting from vi-\nolations of privacy- regulating statutes. Id. at 674–75. Conclud-\ning that the catch -all provision was thus “intractably ambigu-\nous,” id. at 676, the district court concluded that Citizens had \nnot affirmatively established that the claims against \nWynndal co were excluded from coverage and held that Citi-\nzens had a duty to defend Wynndalco as to both the BIPA and \ncommon law claims, id.6 \nII. \nWe review the district court’s decision to enter judgment \non the pleadings de novo.  E.g., StarNet Ins. Co. v. Ruprecht , 3 \nF.4th 342, 346 (7th Cir. 2021). In doing so, we apply the same standard that we reference in reviewing a decision to grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief. Mesa Labs., Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., 994 F.3d 865, 867 (7th Cir. \n2021) (citing Landmark Am. Ins. Co. v. Hilger , 838 F.3d 821, 824 \n(7th Cir. 2016)). We therefore take the facts alleged in the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and we will sustain the entry of judgment only if it is beyond doubt that the nonmoving party cannot prove facts sufficient to support its position and that the movant is entitled to relief. See id.  (citing Hilger , 838 F.3d at 824) ; see also Scottsdale Ins. Co. \nv. Columbia Ins. Grp., Inc., 972 F.3d 915, 919 (7th Cir. 2020) (cit-ing Housing Auth. Risk Retention Grp., Inc. v.

P. 10(c); see Federated Mut. Ins. Co. \nv. Coyle Mech. Supply Inc., 983 F.3d 307, 312– 13 (7th Cir. 2020); \nAdams v. City of Indianapolis , 742 F.3d 720, 729 (7th Cir. 2014). \nThe parties agree that Illinois law governs  this dispute a nd \nwe have no reason to question them on this point: Apart from \nthe fact that Illinois is the forum state, Wynndalco is an Illinois \nfirm, and the injuries alleged in the two actions for which it seeks a defense arose from Wynndalco’s role in the sale to th e \nChicago Police Department of a product granting access to a database containing biometric identifiers and information be-longing to Illinois citizens. As this is a diversity case, our task \nis to resolve the substantive questions as we believe the Illi-\nnois Supreme Court would do. E.g., Newman v. Metro. Life Ins. \nCo., 885 F.3d 992, 1000 (7th Cir. 2018). To determine whether \nCitizens owes Wynndalco a duty to defend it in the Thornley  \nand Calderon litigation, we compare the allegations of the \nThornley  and Calderon  complaints with the relevant provisions \nof the insurance policy to determine whether the nature of the liability asserted falls within the scope of the policy’s cover-age. E.g., United Fire  & Cas. Co. v. Prate Roofing & Installations, \nLLC, 7 F.4th 573, 579– 80 (7th Cir. 2021).\n7 The duty to defend is \nbroader than the duty to indemnify, id. at 579, so the insurer \nmust supply the insured with a defense so long as the facts \n \n7 Unless otherwise noted, all of the cases cited in this opinion applied \nIllinois law.

Co. , 19 F.4th 1002, \n1006 (7th Cir. 2021) (citing Windridge of Naperville Condo. Ass’n v. Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co., 932 F.3d 1035, 1039 (7th Cir. 2019)); Hess v. Estate of Klamm , 161 N.E.3d 183, 187 (Ill. 2020). \nOur primary goal is to ascertain and give effect to intentions of parties as expressed in the policy language. Bradley Hotel \nCorp. , 19 F.4th at 1006; Hess, 161 N.E.3d at 187 (quoting Hobbs \nv. Hartford Ins. Co. of Midwest , 823 N.E.2d 561, 564 (Ill. 2005)). \nWe construe the individual provisions of the policy not in iso-lation but as a whole, giving effect to each and every provi-sion whenever possible. E.g., Founders Ins. Co. v. Mu ñoz, 930 \nN.E.2d 999, 1004 (Ill. 2010). Provided there is no ambiguity in \nthe contract terms, we will accord those terms their ordinary meanings and apply the policy language as written, so long as doing so would not conflict with public policy. Clarendon Nat’l Ins. Co. v. Medina , 645 F.3d 928, 933 (7th Cir. 2011) (citing \nHobbs , 832 N.E.2d at 564); Muñoz , 930 N.E.2d at 1004. Absent \nsome indication that the policy’s terms were intended to have  \n \n8 Because we conclude that Citizens does have a duty to defend \nWynndalco, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether Citizens also \nbears a duty to indemnify Wynndalco, a separate question that is gener-\nally considered premature to resolve unless and until the insured is held liable on the claim for which it seeks coverage. See, e.g., Am. Bankers Ins. \nCo. of Fla. v. Shockley , 3 F.4th 322, 331– 32 (7th Cir. 2021).  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 15 \na technical connotation, we will also read the policy as an or-\ndinary, reasonable layperson purchasing such a policy would \nread them. I/N Kote v. Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection & Ins. \nCo., 115 F.3d 1312, 1317 (7th Cir. 1997) (collecting cases); see \nalso Muñoz , 930 N.E.2d at 1004.  \nPolicy terms that purport to limit the insurance company’s \nliability are construed in favor of coverage, but only when the terms are ambiguous or susceptible to more than one reason-\nable interpretation. Medina, 645 F.3d at 933 (c iting, inter alia , \nHobbs , 823 N.E.2d at 564). Wherever possible, a court should \nconstrue a policy so as to harmonize its provisions and avoid \nreading an exclusion in such a way that it removes the cover-age explicitly provided elsewhere in the policy. Gen. Agents Ins. Co. of Am., Inc. v. Midwest Sporting Goods Co. , 765 N.E.2d \n1152, 1156 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002) (quoting Lincoln Logan Mut. Ins. \nCo. v. Fornshell , 722 N.E.2d 239, 242 (Ill.

Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 3316 No. 22-2313 \nThe latter point deserves some amplification. In some in-\nstances, the language of a policy exclusion may appear clear \nin isolation, but when compared with a separate policy provi-\nsion granting coverage for the same type of action or injury that the exclusion ostensibly reaches, an ambiguity arises, in that the exclusion appears to take away with one hand cover-age that the policy purports to give with the other. See Panfil , \n799 F.3d at 721–22 (quoting Cherrington v. Erie Ins. Prop. & Cas. \nCo., 745 S.E.2d 508, 526 (W. Va. 2013)); see also Tews Funeral \nHome, Inc. v. Ohio Cas. Ins.

The cases sometimes refer to this as the exclusion appearing to “swallow” the coverage that the policy purports to grant the \ninsured. Wynndalco , 595 F.Supp.3d at 673; Fornshell , 722 \nN.E.2d at 242. Because the aim of policy interpretation is to \ngive effect to all provisions of the policy and avoid whenever \npossible construing one provision in a way that tends to nul-lify another provision, a court when confronted with such an \nambiguity m ust consider whether the reach of the “swallow-\ning” exclusion can be deemed more narrow than its plain \nterms taken in isolation would otherwise suggest. Id.; see also \nMidwest Sporting Goods, 765 N.E.2d at 1156–57. If the ambigu-ity cannot be resolved in this  way, it must be construed \nagainst the insurer and in favor of coverage. Panfil , 799 F.3d \nat 721. \nThe plaintiff bears the burden in the first instance of show-\ning that its claim falls within the coverage of the policy.  E.g., \nBradley Hotel Corp. , 19 F.4th at  1006 (citing Addison Ins. Co. v. \nFay, 905 N.E.2d 747, 752 (Ill. 2009). There is no dispute that \nWynndalco has met that burden here. The parties agree that \nthe injur ies alleged in the Thornley  and Calderon  complaints  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 17 \nqualify as  “personal or advertising inj ur[ies]” in that a viola-\ntion of BIPA is a violation of privacy, and the policy defines \n“personal or advertising injury” to include, inter alia , the \n“[o]ral or written publication, in any manner, of material that \nviolates a person’s right to privacy.” Polic y § II(F)(14)(e), \nR. 20-1 at 100. The burden t hus falls on Citizens to affirma-\ntively establish that an exclusion applies.  Id. (citing Fay ). “Ex-\nclusions are read narrowly and apply only if their application \nis clear and free from doubt.” Id. at 1006–07 (cleaned up); see \nalso Zurich Am. Ins. Co. v. Ocwen Fin. Corp. , 990 F.3d 1073, 1078 \n(7th Cir. 2021) (“a decision to excuse an insurer’s duty to de-\nfend based on an exclusionary clause in the contract ‘must be clear and free from doubt’”) (quoting Evergre en Real Estate \nServs., LLC v. Hanover Ins. Co. , 142 N.E.3d 880, 887 (Ill. App. \nCt. 2019)); Gillen v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 830 N.E.2d \n575, 582 (Ill. 2005) (“a policy provision that purports to ex-clude or limit coverage will be read narrowly and will be ap-plied only where its terms are clear, definite, and specific”) (citing Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, Pa. v. Glenview Park \nDist. , 632 N.E.2d 1039, 1042 (Ill. 1994)).  \nCitizens, of course, argues that BIPA is a statute that falls \nwithin th e violation -of-statutes exclusion’s catch -all provision \nfor acts or omissions that transgress “[a]ny other laws, stat-\nutes, ordinances, or regulations , that address, prohibit, or \nlimit the printing, dissemination, disposal, collecting, record-\ning, sending, transmitting, communicating or distribution of \nmaterial or information ,” (Policy § II(B)(1)(q)(4), R. 20 -1 at 91–\n92) in that BIPA governs the collection (“recording”) as well \nas the sale and transmission ( “dissemination,” “sending,” \n“communicating” and “dis tribution”)  of information, in this \ncase biometric identifiers and information. There is no dispute Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 29 \navoids the problem of the exclusion swallowing the policy’s \ncoverage provisions for “personal and advertising injuries.”  \nYet, as the district court pointed out, the statutes listed in \nthe exclusion encompass two distinct types of privacy: seclu-sion and secrecy. 595 F.Supp.3d at 675; see Am. States Ins. Co. v. Capital Assocs. of Jackson Cnty., Inc. , 392 F.3d 939, 941 (7th \nCir. 2004). Seclusion is the right to be left alone. Auto -Owners \nIns. Co. v. Websolv Computing, Inc., 580 F.3d 543, 549 (7th Cir. \n2009) (applying Iowa law, but referencing Illinois law);  \nKrishna, 183 N.E.3d at 58; Valley Forge Ins. Co. v. Swiderski El-\necs., Inc. , 860 N.E.2d 307, 317 (Ill. 2006); Benitez v. KFC Nat’l \nMgmt. Co., 714 N.E.2d 1002, 1033 (Ill. App. Ct 1999). Statutes \nregulating phone calls, faxes, and emails address that type of privacy by imposing restrictions on these methods of commu-\nnication when the individual has not consented to receive \nthem. See Websolv Computing , 580 F.3d at 549; Capital Assocs. , \n392 F.3d at 941, 942. Secrecy, on the other hand, is the right to maintain the confidentiality of one’s personal information. See Websolv Computing , 580 F.3d at 549; Krishna, 183 N.E.3d at 58. \nThe FCRA and FACTA address the secrecy of one’s credit and other personal identifying information by regulating how that information is reported. See Websolv Computing , 580 F.3d \nat 549; Krishna , 183 N.E.3d at 58. BIPA would fall into this \nsame secrecy -related subset of statutes regulating privacy in-\nterests, as it regulates how one’s biometric information may \nbe collected, retained, and shared with others. S ee Krishna , 183 \nN.E.3d at 58. Our decision in Capital Assoc iates, 392 F.3d at \n941–43, notes the distinctions between these two different \ntypes of privacy and admonishes courts to take care in distin-guishing between them as they evaluate in what sense an in-surance policy may be using the term “privacy.” Thus, only \nby referencing privacy at a high level of generality can one  Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 3330 No. 22-2313 \nfind a common thread among these statutes —one that would \nencompass privacy in multiple forms (seclusion in some cases \nand secrecy in oth ers) and addressing distinct interests.  \nWe are not convinced that ejusdem generis can resolve the \nambiguity presented by the exclusion in this way. As we \nnoted earlier, there is nothing in the language of the exclu-sion—be it in the title or in any of the provisions that follow —\nwhich points to privacy as the focus of the exclusion. And a \nproper application of the ejusdem generis canon looks for a \nreadily discernible theme among the specific items cited in a \nprovision that in turn suggests how the broad langu age that \nfollows should be construed. Scalia & Garner, R\nEADING LAW, \nat 199. Here there is no readily discernible theme —certainly \nnothing, as the district court noted in the Cheese Merchants \ncase, that “jumps off the page,” 2022 WL 4483886, at *11, as a \ncommon characteristic uniting the four statutes listed in the \nexclusion, see id., at *11 –*13. True, at a very high level of gen-\nerality, one might describe all four statutes as bearing on in-dividual “privacy,” id.  at *13, but that would not be obvious \nto the type of layperson or business purchasing this policy, given the different ways in which the statutes operate to pro-tect the two distinct categories of privacy interests we have discussed. In this respect, the exclusion here stands in marked contrast to the one at issue in Krishna, where the wording of the exclusion’s heading indicated that it was  statutes regulat-\ning methods of communication that were implicated by the exclusion and the two statutes specifically named by the title fell neatly into that very category of laws. There are no such textual clues to guide the reader to the privacy gloss for which Citizens advocates here. Only by engaging in a relatively so-phisticated and nuanced examination of the four statutes sin-\ngled out by the exclusion and the interests they protect might Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 31 \none be able to identify generic privacy as a theme that unifies \nthose statutes and infer that the catch -all provision, notwith-\nstanding its sweeping language, should be limited to other statutes that likewise address some aspect of personal pri-vacy, be it seclusion, secrecy, or some other form of privacy.\n11 \nThat gives the ejusdem generis canon entirely too much work \nto do.  \nThe noscitur a sociis textual canon fails to resolve the ambi-\nguity posed by the catch -all provision for the same reasons. \n“[T]he principle of noscitur a sociis—a word is known by the company it keeps —[is used] to ‘avoid ascribing to one word \na meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompany-ing words … .’” Yates v. United States, 574 U.S. at 543, 135 S. Ct. at 1085 (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd Co. , 513 U.S. 561, 575, 115 \nS. Ct. 1061, 1069 (1995)); see also Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, \n604, 130 S. Ct. 3218, 3226 (2010) (“Under this canon, ‘an am-biguous term may be given more precise content by the neigh-boring words with which it is associated.’”) (quoting United \n \n11 As we noted in Capital Assoc iates, “’[p]rivacy’ is a word with many \nconnotations.” 392 F.3d at 941. Secrecy and seclusion are the two principal \nmeanings, id., but there are other connotations, including, for example \npersonal autonomy and freedom from government regulation, which may \noverlap with secrecy or seclusion to some extent, but which also reflect distinct interests, see id.

Ct. 1577, 1587 (2010)). \nAs we have discussed, there are no readily -discernible clues \nin the text surrounding the catch -all provision that point to \nprivacy as the factor that harmonizes the catch -all with the \nother provisions of the violation -of-statutes exclusion.  \nConsequently, we return to where we started: On a plain -\ntext reading, the catch -all provision has an extremely broad \nsweep —so broad, in fact, that the exclusion on its face would \neliminate coverage for a number of statutory injuries ex-pressly included in the definition of “personal and advertis-ing injur[ies]” that the policy purports to cover. This clash be-tween competing provisions of the policy gives rise to an am-biguity, one that neither ejusdem generis nor noscitur a sociis can \nplausibly resolve.  We are left with no choice other than to con-\nclude, as did the district court, that the catch -all provision in \nthe violation -of-statutes exclusion is “intractably ambigu-\nous.” 595 F.Supp.3d at 676. Applying yet another well- estab-\nlished canon, we must construe that ambiguity against Citi-zens and in favor of the insured. Panfil , 799 F.3d at 721.  As the \ncatch -all provision says nothing about injuries arising from \nstatutes regulating privacy interests, and the policy defines a covered “persona l and advertising injury” so as to include an \ninjury arising out of the “[o]ral or written publication, in any manner, of material that violates a person’s right of privacy” (Policy § II(F)(14)(e), R. 20 -1 at 100), we conclude that the in-\njuries alleged in the Thornley  and Calderon  complaints at least \npotentially fall within the coverage of the Citizens policy. Cit-izens thus owes its insured, Wynndalco, a duty to defend it against those complaints. Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Shock-ley, supra n.8, 3 F.4th  at 331; Panfil , 799 F.3d at 721–22; Supreme \nLaundry Serv., L.L.C. v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 521 F.3d 743, 749 \n(7th Cir. 2008). This duty extends to the common law claims Case: 22-2313      Document: 38            Filed: 06/15/2023      Pages: 33No. 22-2313 33 \nasserted against Wynndalco in the Thornley  litigation, which \nas Citizens itself argu es, arise out of the same acts or omis-\nsions as the BIPA claim asserted in that suit. Citizens Br. 42 –\n43. \nHaving come to this conclusion, we need not separately \naddress whether, even if Citizens’ reading of the exclusion \nwere correct, the Thornley  plaintiffs’ claim for a violation of \nsection 15(c) of BIPA, which focuses on profiting  from bio-\nmetric information, f alls outside of the wording of the catch -\nall exclusion.  \nIII. \nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals addressed a class-action lawsuit involving a research collaboration between Google and the University of Chicago to develop software using AI to predict healthcare needs using anonymized patient data. The plaintiff, Matt Dinerstein, alleged privacy violations and breaches of contract concerning the handling of his medical records. However, the court dismissed the case, affirming that Dinerstein lacked standing as he did not sufficiently allege concrete or imminent injury resulting from the data transfer.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Dinerstein had Article III standing to sue, given the alleged injuries related to privacy violations, breach of contract, and consumer fraud.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Dinerstein failed to adequately allege a concrete injury, as the purported harms were speculative and lacked sufficient immediacy or concreteness to confer standing. As a result, the case was dismissed for lack of standing.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A man named Matt was upset because a hospital shared his patient information with Google to help develop new software to predict health needs. He felt this was a breach of privacy and sued. But the court said he didn't have a strong enough personal harm to justify a lawsuit because he didn't show any real damage or imminent threat from what happened. So, they dismissed his case.",

This class- action lawsuit arises from a \nresearch collaboration  between Google and the University of \nChicago  together with its affiliated Medical Center . (We will \nrefer to the latter two as “the University”  unless the context Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 332 No. 20-3134 \nrequires otherwise. ) Harnessing the power of artificial \nintelligence , the research partners aspired to develop soft-\nware  capable of  anticipat ing patients’  future healthcare  \nneeds . If successful , the software promised  to reduce  medi-\ncal complications , eliminate  unnecessary hospital stays , and, \nultimately, improve  patients’ healthcare outcomes . \nAs an initial step in the research effort , the University  de-\nlivered several years of anonymized patient medical records  \nto Google , thus  suppl ying  it with the information needed to \n“train ” the software’s algorithms . A Data Use Agreement  \ngoverned the transfer . Restricting Google’s  use of the rec-\nords  to a list of specific research -related activities , the \nagreement expressly prohibited the company  from attempt-\ning to identify any  patient  whose records were  disclosed .  \nThe anonymized electronic records subject to the agree-\nment  included those of Matt Dinerstein, twice an inpatient at \nthe hospital during the period covered by the  records  disclo-\nsure.  Dinerstein sued  Google and the University on behalf of \nhimself and a class of other  patient s whose anonymize d \nrecords were disclose d. He alleged s everal theories of liabil-\nity. He first claimed that the University had breached either \nan express or an implied contract  traceable to a privacy \nnotice he received and  an authorization he signed upon each \nadmission  to the Medical Center. Alternatively, he asserted a \nclaim for unjust enrichment. Citing the same notice and \nauthorization, he also  alleged that the University had re-\nneged on its promise of patient confidentiality and therefore \nviolated the Illino is Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Busi-\nness Practices Act, 815 I LL. COMP. STAT. 505/1 et seq . Against  \nGoogle , he asserted  claims for unjust enrichment and tor-\ntious interfer ence  with his contract with  the University. Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 3 \nFinally, he brought  a privacy claim against  all defendants \nbased  on allegations of intrusion upon seclusion . \nThe district judge dismissed the consumer -fraud  claim \nfor lack of  standing and the rest of the suit  for failure to state \na claim. We agree with  her decision to dismis s the case, but \nour analysis  begins and ends with standing . Dinerstein has \nnot adequately alleged standing to pursue  any of his claims . \nTo sue in federal court, a plaintiff must plausibly allege  (and \nlater prove)  that he has suf fered a n injury in fact that is  \nconcrete  and particularized, actual or immin ent, and tracea-\nble to the defendant’s conduct. T he injuries Dinerstein  \nallege s lack  plausibility,  concreteness, or imminence  (or \nsome combination of the three ). Because the complaint  fails \nto plausibly allege a n injury  in fact, we affirm but modify the \njudgment to reflect a jurisdictional dismissal for lack of \nstanding.  \nI. Background \nOur factual account is drawn from Dinerstein’s amended \ncomplaint . We begin  with a description of his  inpatient stays \nat the University Medical Center —and  more particularly, \nthe paperwork he received at the start of each admission . \nDinerstein alleges that he was first admitted to the Medical \nCenter  on June 4, 2015 , and was discharged three days later . \nHe was then readmitted on June  25, this time for a two- night \nstay. Upon each admission Dinerstein received a Notice of \nPrivacy Practices detailing the University’s confidentiality \nobligations and the circumstances in which it might use or disclose patient medical information. Relevant here, the \nnotice stated that the University would  obtain “written \npermission” for the sale of such  information.  Patient p ermis-\nsion was not required, however, for the University to use or Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 334 No. 20-3134 \nshare the information in limited research -related circum-\nstances. In addition to the n otice, Dinerstein  received and \nsigned an Admission and Outpatient Agreement and Au-\nthorization . By doing so he affirmed that he understood  that \nhis medical information might  be shared for approved \nresearch purposes and that if so, he would “not be entitled to \nany compensation.” He further acknowledged that “all efforts” would “be made to protect [his] privacy” and that “any use of [his] medical information” would comply with both the n otice a nd “federal and state laws.” \nDuring Dinerstein’s two hospital stays,  the University \ncompiled records of his  vital readings , medical procedures, \nprescriptions, test results, and diagnoses. The records also  \ncontained  demographic information . After each  discharge \nfrom the  hospital, the Medical Center  maintained  electronic \ncopies o f his patient records.  \nApproximately two years after Dinerstein’s hospital vis-\nits, Google announced that it had partnered with the Univer-\nsity to research new healthcare technology. With the help of \nmachine  learning, the research partners aspired to develop \npredictive modeling software t hat would  improve  the ability \nof medical providers  to forecast their patients’ medical needs \nand, in turn , to tailor  subsequent medical care. As described \nin promotional statements, the  project had the potential  to \nprevent medical complications, reduce hospital visits, and \nimprove overall health and well -being.\n1 \n \n1 Matt Wood, UChicago Medicine Collaborates with Google to Use Machine \nLearning for Better Health Care, UCHICAGO  MEDICINE  (May 17, 2017) , \nhttps://www.uchicagomedicine .org/forefront/research -and-discoveries-\narticles/uchicago -medicine -collaborates -with -google -to-use-machine -\nlearning -for-better -health- care.  Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 5 \nTo reliably predict medical outcomes , the models needed \nextensive information from which  to learn. The  University \nthus agreed to transfer to Google a large set of  anonymized \npatient medical records. A Data Use Agreement executed by \nthe partne rs in December 2016 governed the transfer. While \nmost of the agreement’s provisions are irrelevant  for our \npurposes , a few deserve mention . First, the agreement \ncontemplated that befor e disclo sure  the University would \nstrip the  patient records  of all direct  identifying informatio n \nexcept the dates of medical events  and services. Second,  the \nagreement delineated the records’ authorized uses.  In par-\nticular , Google was permitted  to use  the records  only to \nidentif y key medical information , to develop predictive \nmodels , and to assess the models’ efficacy . It could neither \ndisclose information from within  the record s nor use the \nrecords  in contravention of  federal law.  Most importantly, \nthe agreement strictly  prohibited Google from using the \nrecords “to identify any individual.” Third, if the parties’ \nresearch efforts proved successful, the agreement  granted \nthe University a perpetual license to use the predictive models  for its own “internal  non- commercial  research  \npurposes. ” \nThe batch of medical records covered by the Data Use \nAgreement  spanned several years . Specifically , the agree-\nment directed the University to transfer to Google anony-mized records generated from all inpatient, outpatient, and \nemergency adult -patient encounters  between January 1, \n2010, and June 30, 2016. Both of Dinerstein’s overnight stays \noccurred in June 2015 , so his medical records were included \nin the set disclosed to Go ogle.  Dinerstein alleges that  the \nUniversity  never obtained his consent —written or other- Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 336 No. 20-3134 \nwise —for  the third -party record disclosure.  Nor did Google \nseek  permission to use  his records.  \nDinerstein filed suit against  the University and Google  \nseeking damages a nd injunctive relief on behalf of himself \nand a class of patients whose anonymized records were \ndisclosed . He raised seven claims for relief . Against the \nUniversity he alleged claims for  breach of an express or  an \nimplied contract  premised on the n otice he received and  the \nauthorization  he signed upon each admission  to the Medical \nCenter. More to the point, Dinerstein alleged that in ex-\nchange for hi s payment and personal medical information , \nthe University  had agreed  to protect  and secure  his infor-\nmation . By sharing it with Google, the University  had failed \nto uphold its end of the bargain.  As an alternative to his \ncontract claims, Dinerstein  sought damages for unjust  \nenrich ment . He also alleged a claim for violation of  the \nIllinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices \nAct. This statutory claim rest ed on the alleged  broken prom-\nises, which Dinerstein asserted  the University never intend-\ned to keep in the first place . \nTurning to Google , Dinerstein alleged that the com pany  \nhad tortious ly interfere d with his contract wit h the Universi-\nty. H e also asserted  a claim for unjust enrichment based on \nthe company’s receipt of  valuable  patient  medical records . \nFinally, Dinerstein brought a tort claim against Google and \nthe Univers ity for invasion of  privacy . More specifically, he \nalleged that they had intruded upon his seclusion  by send-\ning and  receiving  his sensitive medical information.  \nRelevant to th is last theory of liability , Dinerstein claimed \nthat while he was an inpatient  at the Medical Center, he  had \nused a smartphone with geolocation capabilities . Because he Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 7 \nhad also downloaded v arious Google apps , he alleged that \nthe phone  granted  the company  access to  his precise location \nduring every moment of his  hospital st ays. He further \nalleged that if Googl e compared his location data with the \ninsufficiently anonymized p atient records, it could easily \nascertain his identit y and uncover  “intimate private details” \nin his  medical histories . And he alleged that Google could do \nthe same thing  with other class members’ geo location data.  \nThe defendants moved to dismiss  under Rule s 12(b)(1) \nand (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . They  argu ed \nthat Dinerstein  had not  allege d a concrete  injury to support \nArticle III standing and, alternatively, that he had  not state d \na cognizable claim.  The judge granted the motion, a greeing \nprimarily with the  latter argument and dismiss ing the \ncomplaint in its entirety.   \nOn the standing issue, the judge  construed  Dinerstein ’s \nalleg ations about a lost  benefit of the bargain as sufficient to \nsupport standing to sue on the contract  (and contract -\nalternative ) theories  against both the University  and Google . \nDinerstein v. Google, LLC , 484 F. Supp. 3d 561, 574 (N.D. Ill. \n2020). S he also reasoned that the allegations about a n inva-\nsion of privacy —in the form of a  wrongful disclosure of his \nprivate medical information —support ed Dinerstein’s stand-\ning to sue  for intrusion upon seclusion . Id. at 575. But t he \njudge  dismissed the consumer -fraud  claim  for lack of stand-\ning because “[a] claim under [the Illinois Consumer Fraud \nand Deceptive Business Practices Act]  requires a showing of \nactual damages,” which Dinerstein  had not alleged.  Id. at 579 \n(citing 815 I LL. COMP. STAT. 505/10a(a)). \nMoving on , the judge dismissed the claims for breach of \ncontract —express or implied—f or failure to state a cogniza- Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 338 No. 20-3134 \nble claim b ecause Dinerstein  had not adequately pleaded \neconomic damage s, a required element under Illinois law . Id. \nat 590–93; F ED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6).  Next , the judge noted but \nchose  not to decide the question whether Dinerstein’s claim  \nfor tortious  interference with contract necessarily fell with \nthe other contract claims. Instead , she held that the claim  \nfailed for a separate reason: Dinerstein had not sufficiently  \npleaded that Google  had intentionally caused the  University’s  \nbreach  of contract. Id. at 593. (Intent is n ecessary to state a \nclaim of tortious interference with contract  in Illinois.  HPI \nHealth Care Servs., Inc. v. Mt. Vernon Hosp., Inc., 545 N.E.2d \n672, 676 (Ill. 1989).) \nTurning to the p rivacy claim, the judge observed that \nDinerstein had re characterized his original intrusion -upon -\nseclusion  claim as a novel tort claim for breach of medical \nconfidentiality , a theory n ot yet recognized in Illinois. The \njudge thought it unlikely that the Illinois Supreme Court \nwould  recognize such a claim, so she declined to permit \nDinerstein to p ursue it  in federal court.  That left only the \nunjust -enrichment claim s. Because unjust enrichment is not \nan independent cause of action in Illinois,  the judge dis-\nmissed  those claim s as well . Dinerstein appealed.  \nII. Discussion  \nThe dismissal order rests partly on a fai lure to allege  \nArticle  III standing but mostly on the judge’s conclusion that \nDinerstein failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . Our review of either basis for dismissal is de novo . \nNowlin v. Pritzker , 34 F.4th 629, 632 (7th Cir. 2022). T he \nparties  primarily focus on  whether the amended  complain t \nsatisfies the statutory and common -law pleading require-\nments particular to each claim. But the threshold question is Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 9 \nstanding , which “is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.” \nNettles v. Midland Funding LLC , 983 F.3d 896, 899 (7th Cir. \n2020).  \nStanding doctrine traces its origins  to Article III  of the \nConstitution, which grants federal courts the power to \nresolve “Cases” and  “Controversies.” U.S.  CONST . art. III, § 2.  \nThe doctrine’s elements are well  established and familiar . To \nsue in federal court, a plaintiff must have suffered (1) a \nconcrete, particularized, and actual or imminent injury  (an \n“injury in fact” ) (2) that is fairly traceable to the defendant \nand (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992). \n“[A]t the pleading stage, the plaintiff must clearly  … allege \nfacts demonstrating each element.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , \n578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (quotation marks omitted). Moreo-\nver, “standing is not dispensed in gross; rather, plaintiffs must demonstrate standing for each claim that they press \nand for each form of relief that they seek.” TransUnion LLC v. \nRamirez , 141 S. Ct. 2190, 2208 (2021). \nLike many of our recent cases concerning Article III \nstanding , this one  hinges on the injury -in-fact element , and \nin particular, the concreteness and imminence requirements.  \nWhile the concreteness requirement examines  the substance \nof a plaintiff’s asserted injury , the imminence requirement \nmeasures its likelihood. In other words , to provide a basis to \nsue in federal court, an inj ury must exist  “in both a qualita-\ntive and [a] temporal sense.” Whitmore v. Arkansas , 495 U.S. \n149, 155 (1990).  \nStarting with the qualitative aspe ct, “[a] concrete injury  \nmust be de facto; that is, it must  actually exist.” Spokeo, \n578 U.S. at 340 (quotation marks omitted). Endorsing the Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3310 No. 20-3134 \nterm’s “usual meaning,”  the Supreme Court has  described a \nconcrete injury as one that is “real [] and not abstract.” Id. \n(quotation marks omitted). Both tangible and intangible \nharms  may fit th e bill, even if tangible  harms  like “physical \nor monetary injur[ies]” are  perhaps more intuitively con-\ncrete. TransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at 2204. As the Court has ex-\nplained, o ur task—especially when the  plaintiff assert s an  \nintangible harm —is to assess whether the  alleged  injury has \n“a close relationship to a harm traditionally recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts .” Id. \n(quotation marks omitted). The inquiry asks whether the plaintiff has “identified a close historical or common -law \nanalogue” for his asserted injury.  Id. Put another way , when \nreviewing a  plaintiff’s alleged injury for concreteness,  \n“[h]istory and tradition remain our ever -present g uides.” \nPierre v.

While it  lacks a precise framework , the \nbasic function of the imminence requirement  “is to ensure \nthat the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III \npurposes.” Id. Accordingly, a plaintiff who has not suffered \na past harm  cannot  simply  rest on allegations  that he may \nsuffer some “possible future injury,” Whitmore , 495 U.S. at \n158, “at some indefinite future time ,” Lujan , 504 U.S. at 564 \nn.2. His threatened injury instead must be “ certainly impend-\ning” to satisfy Article III.  Id. And importantly, while an \nimminent risk of future harm may suffice to support stand-\ning to sue for prospective  relie f (i.e., an injunction), a claim for  \ndamages requires a concrete harm that has in fact occurred. \nTransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at 2210–11. Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 11 \nWith these fundamental standing principles in mind, we \nturn to the claims  presented  in this case. At the outset, \nhowever, we note  that Dinerstein omitted from his opening \nbrief any discussion about the  claims for unjust enrichment \nor breach  of an implied contract. By doing so, he abandoned \nthese claims on appeal , and  we need not consider them.  See \nWhite v. United States , 8 F.4th 547, 552 (7th Cir. 2021); see also \nFED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(8)(A) (requiring th at the appellant’s \nbrief include his  “contentions and the reasons for them”). \nWhat remains  is the privacy claim, the  claim for breach of an \nexpress contract, the consumer -fraud  claim , and the claim \nfor tortious  interference with contract . We address each in \nturn.  \nA.  Privacy Claim  \nWe begin  with the alleged breach of privacy  because the \nasserted  injury  underlying this claim is  common to all claims \nthat remain live  on appeal . In other words, our resolution of \nthe standing issue on this claim necessarily resolves portions \nof others, streamlining our discussion of the  claims  that \nfollow . \nBefore diving into the standing analysis, we must discern \nwhat, exactly, Dinerstein’s privacy  claim is. His complaint \ncharacterizes the defendants’  conduct as a common -law \nintrusion  upon seclusion, which is potentially actionable \nwhen the alleged tortfeasor  “intentionally intrudes, physical-\nly or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another.” \nRESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF TORTS § 652(B) ( AM. LAW INST. \n1977) [hereinafter RESTATEMENT ]. The Illinois Supreme Court \nhas adopted this definition  of the tort, describ ing the pur-\npose of the seclusion right as “protecting a person from \nanother’s prying into their physical boundaries or affairs.” Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3312 No. 20-3134 \nW. Bend Mut . Ins. Co. v. Krishna Schaumburg Tan, Inc. , \n183 N.E.3d 47, 58 ( Ill. 2021) ; see also Lovgren v. Citizens First \nNat’l Bank, 534 N.E.2d 987, 988–89 (Ill. 1989). \nApparently  accepting  that neither defendant’s  conduct \nfits the elements of th is tort, Dinerstein  abandon ed his \nintrusion -upon -seclusion theory  below , as the district judge \nnoted . Dinerstein , 484 F. Supp. 3d at 594. In his re spon se to  \nthe defendants’  motion to dismiss , Dinerstein  reframe d his \nprivacy claim  as a breach  of medical confidentiality , a novel \ncause o f action that posits a common -law duty of medical \nprovider s to maintain  patient confidentiality. Several  states \nhave recogn ized some variety of this  tort. See, e.g., Lawson v. \nHalpern -Reiss, 212 A.3d 1213, 1219 (Vt. 2019); Byrne v. Avery \nCtr. for Obstetrics & Gynecology, P.C., 175 A.3d 1 , 17 (Conn. \n2018); McCormick v. England , 494 S.E.2d 431, 437 (S.C. Ct. \nApp.  1997). But Illinois is not one of the m. Dinerstein there-\nfore invited the district judge, sitting in diversity,  to hold \nthat the Illinois Su preme Court  would recognize the tort \nunder Illinois law . See Zahn v. N. Am. Power & Gas, LLC , \n815 F.3d 1082, 1087 (7th Cir. 2016) ( [W]e must use our own \nbest judgment to estimate how the [I llinois] Supreme Court \nwould rule as to its law.”  (quotation marks omitted)).  As \nwe’ve noted, the judge declined that invitation . Dinerstein , \n484 F. Supp. 3d at 595.  \nMore importantly for our purposes, however, Dinerstein \nhas chosen  to stick with the new  version  of his  privacy  claim \non appeal. H e premise s his privacy -related challenges  \nexclusively on the novel medical- confidentiality theory. \nFollowing his lead,  then,  we focus our discussion o f standing \non the reframed privacy theory .  Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 13 \nDinerstein presents his privacy injury in two forms , one \nbackward -looking and the other forward -looking. But \nconsidered in either direction —past  or future —his asserted \ninjury does not establish standing to sue.  \n1.  Past Harm  \nWe start with the backward -looking form of injury . Cru-\ncially, Dinerstein does not allege  that Google has already \nused the  disclosed  patient records to discern  his identity . \nInstead he focus es on the conduct of the University , arguing  \nthat the record transfer was itself  an actionable  invasion of \nhis medical privacy . This is so, Dinerstein asserts, regardless  \nof whether Google ever actually  identifies  him .  \nBy referencing a common -law privacy invasion, \nDinerstein  attempts to compare his asserted injury to a harm \n“traditionally recognized as providing a basis for lawsuits in \nAmerican courts.” TransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at 2204. In other \nwords, he engages with the proper inquiry under the \nSupreme  Court’s recent standing caselaw.  But as we’ve  \nexplained, an “invasion of privacy” is not a standalone tort; \nthe term “encompasse[ s] four theories of wrongdoing: intru-\nsion upon seclusion, appropriation of a person’s name or \nlikeness , publicity given to private life, and publicity placing \na person in a false light.” Pucillo v. Nat’l Cred it Sys., Inc., \n66 F.4th 634, 639–40 (7th Cir. 2023) (quoting Persinger v. S w. \nCredit Sys., L.P., 20 F.4th 1184, 1192 (7th Cir. 2021) ); see also \nRESTATEMENT  §§ 65 2A–652E. And because TransUnion \nrequires us to nail down a particular common -law analogue, \nwe must assess whether any of the  recognized privacy torts \nis sufficiently analogous to Dinerstein’s asserted injury . If \nnot, no concrete harm. “N o concrete harm, no standing.” \nTransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at 2214. Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3314 No. 20-3134 \nOf the four  traditional  privacy tort theories , the closest \ncomparator to Dinerstein’s new theory is probably the tort of \npublicity given to private life , which  occurs when someone \n“gives publicity ” to a “highly offensive”  matter “concerning \nthe private life of another ” that “is not of legitimate concern  \nto the public .” R ESTATEMENT § 652D. Yet Dinerstein has \nidentified no case in which a court has permitted a plaintiff \nto bring  a public -disclosure tort  premised on the dissemina-\ntion of anonymized  information .2 Indeed, while  the relevant  \ncaselaw is sparse, we ’re skeptical that this alleged factual \nscenario  would  give rise to any injury at all —let alone one \nconcrete enough to support Article III standing . See, e.g.,  \nShulman v. Grp. W Prods., Inc., 955 P.2d 469, 489 n.12 (Cal. \n1998) (“[C]omplete lack of identification or identifiability \nwould seemingly defeat a private facts claim, as there could be no injury … .”); Harris ex rel. Harris v. Easton Pub l’g Co., \n483 A.2d 1377, 1385 (P a. 1984) (“Absent an ability to identify \nthe complainant, there can be no communicatio n and hence, \nno publicity.”); cf. Frobose v. Am. Sav. & Loan Ass’n , 152 F.3d \n602, 618 (7th Cir. 1998) (rejecting a false -light claim because \nthe communication neither mentioned the plaintiff by name nor made her “readily identifiable to the public”).  \nResisting this conclusion,  Dinerstein  contend s that the \nUniversity’s records were ins ufficiently anonymized. He \ncites a presentation from the 2017 Google Cloud Next con-\nference by Dr. Samuel Volchenboum, the University’s \nAssociate Chief Research Informatics Officer. Dinerstein argues that Dr. Volchenboum ’s presentation highlighted  \n \n2 Nor has Dinerstein identified a case in which a court has permitted a \nplaintiff to bring the novel  claim of breach of medical confidentiality in \ncircumstances like these.  Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 15 \nvarious deficiencies in the “typical de -identification pro-\ncess.”3 He contends that the  process risks leaving  identifying \nclues like the patient’s  age, place of residence, and family \nrelations  scattered  throughout the purportedly  “de -\nidentified” medical records . According to Dinerstein, s uch \nclues are routinely found  in the treating physician’ s “free -\ntext”  clinical notes . If these clues are pieced together, \nreidentification is supposedly simple . \nBut Dinerstein’s complaint omits any allegation s linking \nthe so -called “typical de -identification process”  described in \nDr. Volchenboum’s presentation  to the University’s de-\nidentification process here . Put differently,  just because  some \nde-identification process es might be deficient, we cannot \nassume that the University’s process was necessarily so.  To \nthe contrary,  the complaint acknowledges  that the chal-\nlenged record transfer occurred pursuant to the  Data Use \nAgreemen t, which state s that “the majority of [patient] \nidentifiers will be removed,” leaving only “actual dates of \n[medical] service and events.”  Dinerstein’s allegations  of \ninsufficient ano nymization  therefore do not cross the plausi-\nbility threshold. See Silha v. ACT, Inc., 807 F.3d 169, 174 (7th \nCir. 2015) ( “[T]he Twombly -Iqbal facial plausibility require-\nment for pleading a claim is incorporated into the standard for pleading subject matter  jurisdiction.”).  \nMoreover , Dinerstein appears to  concede that the Uni-\nversity  adequately discharged its de -identification obliga-\ntion. D escrib ing a jointly authored articl e from the \nUniversity and Google , the complaint  states  that although  \n \n3 Google Cloud Tech, Sensitive Data Management for Collaborative Research \nClouds (Go ogle Cloud Next '17) , YOUTUBE (Mar. 9, 2017), \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Si956MXhWQ.   Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3316 No. 20-3134 \n“the [date  stamps] from the University patients’ records \nwere maintained,”  the records otherwise had been  “de-\nidentified.” And aside  from the date stamps, Dinerstein does \nnot pinpoint any information with in the records that  he \nthinks  should have been redacted  and was  not. Nor does he \nallege that the date stamps alone were impermissibly identi-\nfying. At most he alleges that some personally identifying \ninformation “may have evaded redaction ”—a hypothetical  \nthat does not  support his repeated but conclusory assertions  \nthat the University’s records  were insufficiently anony-\nmized.  “Such … bare assertion [s] of harm—unsupported by \nany concrete details ”—do not suffice to allege  a plausible , \nconcrete injury. Nowlin , 34 F.4th at 633. \n2.  Risk of Future Harm  \nThat bri ngs us to Dinerstein’s allegations of a forward -\nlooking privacy injury . Unlike the backward -lookin g injury, \nthis injury turns on Google’s conduct—or  more precisely, its  \nanticipated  conduct. At bottom , Dinerstein worries that  the \ndate stamps contained in the transferred medical records , \nalong with  the geolocation and demographic data collected \nfrom his smartphone apps, offer Google a “perfect formula-tion of data points” for later  reidentification. In other words, \nthe record transfer created a risk  that he might  someday be \nreidentified.  \nTo the extent that Dinerstein rests his claim for damages \non allegations of future risk, the argument is a nonstarter.  In \nTransUnion  the Supreme Court clarified that un less a “risk of \nfuture harm materializes,”  a plaintiff may rely on an “immi-\nnent and substantial” risk of harm only when  “pursu[ing] \nforward -looking, injunctive relief to prevent the harm from \noccurring.” 141 S. Ct. at 2210–11 (emphasis added). Or as our Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 17 \ncourt has summarized: “A plaintiff seeking money damages \nhas standing to sue in federal court only for harms that have \nin fact materialized.” Pierre, 29 F.4th at 938. Because Dinerstein  alleges no material harm arising  from the alleged  \nrisk of future reidentific ation, that future risk cannot support \nstanding to sue for damages. \nThe alleged risk does not support standing to sue for  in-\njunctive relief  either, though for a different reaso n: the risk \nDinerstein  alleges  is not sufficiently imminent.  To be sure, \nGoogle possesses a wealth of data about most , if not all, \nAmericans. Yet Dinerstein ignores that the governing Data \nUse Agreement  expressly  prohibited Google from using the \ntransferred medical records —either by themselves  or in \ntandem with data  already in its possession —“to identify any \nindividual.”  And e ven if th e contractual obligation  doesn’t \nitself  foreclose the risk  of reidentification , Dinerstein has not \nalleged that Google has taken any steps to identify him . Nor, \nfor that matter,  does he allege that Google intends  to do so. \nWithout any allegations to that effect, “we cannot simply \npresume a material risk of concrete harm.” TransUnion , \n141 S. Ct. at 2212 ( quoting Ramirez v. TransUnion LLC , \n951 F.3d 1008, 1040 (9th Cir. 2020) (opini on of McKeown, J.) ). \nThe risk of future injury is thus nowhere near “certainly \nimpending”; it is too speculative to satisfy the imminence \nrequirement for a suit for injunctive relief in federal court.  \nClapper v. Amnesty International  USA , 568 U.S. 398 (2013), \nsupports this  holding.  In Clapper  attorneys and human -rights \norganizations raised  constitutional  challenge s to § 1881a of \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, arguing that  \nindividuals with whom they  regularly  communicated were  \nprobable targets of foreign electronic surveillance under the Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 29 \nbecause common -law courts allowed a plaintiff  to vindicate \nhis contract ual rights without a further showing of injury, he \nneed not allege anything aside from t he University’s bare \nbreach of contract.  \nTrue , common -law courts historically heard  contract cas-\nes and awarded  nominal damages  even when the breach  \neither  “caused no loss” or “the amount of the loss [wa]s not \nproved.” R ESTATEMENT (SECOND ) OF CONTRACTS § 346(2) (A M. \nLAW INST. 1981) ; see also  Springer v. Cleveland Clinic Emp. \nHealth Plan Total Care , 900 F.3d 284, 292–93 (6th Cir. 2018)  \n(Thapar, J., concurring) (“[Common -law courts] entertained \nbreach -of-contract claims even when no real loss  [could] be \nprove [n]. Such violations at least deserve d nominal damag-\nes … .” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Yet “[t]he \nrequirements of Art [icle] III are not satisfied merely because \na party … has couched [his]  request  for forms of relief \nhistorically associated with courts of law in terms that have a \nfamiliar ring to those trained in the legal process.” Valley \nForge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & \nState, Inc. , 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982).  \nMore importantly, however,  Spokeo and TransUnion  put \nan end to  federal courts hearing claims premised on nonex-\nistent injur ies—regardless  of historical pedigree.6 And the \nCourt’s recently announced  “historical -analogue test” does \nnot suggest  otherwise. That test asks whether a modern \ninjury  bears a “close relationship ” to a harm traditionally \n \n6 See William Baude, Standing in the Shadow of Congress , 2016 S. CT. REV. \n197,  217 (“[I]t is hard to see how nominal damages are fully consistent \nwith the logic of Spokeo. The very premise of nominal damages is that \none cannot show any ‘actual injury’ apart from the violation of the legal \nright itself.” (citing Carey v. Piphus , 435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978)) ). Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3330 No. 20-3134 \nrecognized by common -law courts. TransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at \n2204. It does not, however, transform into a concrete factual \ninjury what the common law has historically  regarded as a  \nlegal injury . Put differently , a historical record is no talis-\nman. It is n ecessary, but not sufficient, to satisfy the \nArticle  III concreteness requirement . \nStill, because Dinerstein views Spokeo, TransUnion , and \nThole  as inapposite, he argues that our prior decision in J.P. \nMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. McDonald , 760 F.3d 646 (7th Cir. \n2014), binds us. Relevant here, at issue in J.P. Morgan was \nwhether a bank had standing to block an ongoing arbitration \nproceeding that two investors  had initiated after losing \napproximately a quarter of their  initial investment.  The \ncontracts governing the  investors’  account s included a \nforum- selection clause that required  disputes to be brought \nin either state or federal court. Id. at 649. Seeking to enforce \nthe forum- selection  provision, the bank sued the investors in \nfederal court . After months of litigation, the judge dismissed \nthe bank’s claims for lack of standing. Id. at 650. \nReversing the dismissal, we held that the bank had \nstanding to enforce the clause.  To form a bilat eral contract,  \neach party must  “take on one or more legally binding obliga-\ntions ,” we explained.  Id. “When one party fails to honor its \ncommitments, the other party to the contract suffers a legal injury sufficient to create standing even where that party seems not to have incurred monetary loss or other concrete \nharm.” Id. at 650–51. Because the bank had alleged that the \ninvestors had “violated the terms of th[eir ] bargain” by \nselecting  an improper  dispute -resolution forum, it had \nestablished standing to su e. Id. at 651. Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 31 \nDinerstein understandably seizes on  this favorable lan-\nguage, but he omits  the discussion that follows it. We went \non to explain  in J.P. Morgan  that the bank had “a very real \nfinancial interest in the arbitration” because it was statutori-\nly and contractually obligated to “foot the bill” for the \nresulting costs. Id. Given th is independent financial interest , \nthe standing question was not merely “one of abstract \nprinciple ”; it was yet another reason why the bank had \nstanding  to sue . Id.  \nThe concrete  harm s present in J.P. Morgan —being hauled \ninto an improper  forum and financing the resulting  costs—\ndistinguish it from this cas e. Moreover, while those  harms \nprevent us from needing to revisit  J.P. Morgan , we note that \nsome language in the opinion  is in tension with the Supreme \nCourt’s recent decisions in Spokeo and TransUnion . No longer \nis “a legal injury sufficient to create standing.” J.P. Morgan , \n760 F.3d at 651. “[U]nder Article III, an injury in law is not \nan injury in fact. Only those plaintiffs who have been con-\ncretely harmed ” by a defendant may sue  in federal court . \nTransUnion , 141 S. Ct. at  2205. Any  portion of our  opinion in \nJ.P. Morgan that suggests  otherwise cannot control  here.  \nFinally, we recognize that some tension also exists be-\ntween our analysis  here and  that of a few of our sister cir-\ncuits.  There is no direct con flict, however . For starters, many \nof the out -of-circuit decisions  pointing in the other direction \npredate TransUnion , a watershed decision on the standing \ndoctrine . See, e.g. , Mitchell v. Blue C ross Blue Shield , 953 F.3d \n529, 536 (8th Cir. 2020); Springer , 900 F.3d at 287; Katz v. \nPershing, LLC , 672 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 2012). Of the circuits to \nconsider the issue post -TransUnion , we understand one to \nagree with our position , Perry v. Newsom , 18 F.4th 622, 632 Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 3332 No. 20-3134 \n(9th Cir. 2021) (“An analogy to a traditionally recognized \ncause of action does not relieve a complainant of its burden to demonstrate an injury.”); one to leave it unresolved, \nGlennborough Home owners Ass’n v. U.S. Postal Serv ., 21 F.4th \n410, 415–16 (6th Cir. 2021) ( “We need not resolve these \nthorny questions today … .”) ; and one to come out the other \nway , Denning v. Bond Pharmacy, Inc., 50 F.4th 445, 451 ( 5th \nCir. 2022)  (“[A] breach of contract is a sufficient injury for \nstanding purposes.”) . But the Fifth Circuit’s opinion  in \nDenning  did not engage with the logic of Spokeo and \nTransUnion  and rested in part on its own precedent . We \ntherefore do not understand  the Fifth Circuit’s decision  to \nconflict with our own, nor are we inclined to adopt its approach. As we read Thole , TransUnion,  and Spokeo, a \nbreach of contract alone —without any actual harm —is \npurely an injury in law, not an injury in fact . And it therefore  \nfalls short of the  Articl e III requirements for  a suit in federal \ncourt . \nC.  Remaining Claims  \nWe need not spend much time addressing th e tortious -\ninterference and consumer -fraud  claim s. Both re st on the \nsame allegations of a privacy, pecuniary, or  contractual \ninjur y that we’ve already examined and deemed  insufficient \nto confer standing.  \nPut simply , Dinerstein seeks to invoke the power of the \nfederal court s to challenge the lawfulness of  an event that \ncaused him no harm. But federal courts do not offer  “judicial \ndetermination[s] that the plaintiffs’ interpretation of the law \nis correct” ; we resolve cases and controversies. Uzuegbunam , \n141 S. Ct. at 804 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) . Because  \nDinerstein  has not alleged a  plausible, concrete, and actual Case: 20-3134      Document: 50            Filed: 07/11/2023      Pages: 33No. 20-3134 33 \nor imminent injury  to support his standing to sue , no such \ncase or controversy exists here . We accordingly modify the \njudgment to reflect a jurisdictional dismissal for lack of \nstanding . As modi fied, the judgment  is \nAFFIRMED .

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In the case of Moomaw v. GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd, the plaintiffs allege that GeoSnap violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting and using facial geometry biometrics without consent. The court denied GeoSnap's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, as GeoSnap utilized its AI-driven photo platform, which facilitated the extraction of facial biometrics from photos, to engage in commerce with Illinois residents through events such as Tough Mudder.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue is whether the court has personal jurisdiction over GeoSnap, an Australian company, due to its business activities involving the collection of biometric data from Illinois residents via its AI-oriented photo platform.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that it has personal jurisdiction over GeoSnap because it purposefully directed its activities at Illinois through its online platform, which facilitated biometric data collection of Illinois residents. The court found GeoSnap's engagements, such as partnerships with events in Illinois and the use of facial recognition AI, constituted purposeful availment of Illinois' market.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation:** Imagine a company in Australia that helps people find photos of themselves at fun events using computer programs that recognize faces (like what your phone does with selfies, but more advanced). Some people in Illinois used this service without seeing a message that says their face info would be stored and used. When these people got mad and took the company to court, claiming this wasn’t allowed, the company tried to say the court wasn't the boss of them because they're in another country.

(Doc. 38).\n2  \n1 Defendants removed this action from the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, Illinois pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1332, 1441, 1446, and 1453 .\n2 On April 12, 2024, GeoSnap and former defendant GeoSnapShot Inc. moved to reconsider the Court’s \nOrder denying its Motion to Dismiss or, alternatively, to Modify the Order to Make it Appealable. \nThereafter, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Comp laint. The First Amended Complaint dropped \nGeoSnapShot Inc as a defendant and added Sarah Gustafson as a plaintiff. (Doc. 58). As a result, the Court \ndenied the initial motion to reconsider as moot. (Doc. 59). The Court then granted GeoSnap’s motion Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 1 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>2 \n I. JURISDICTIONAL FACTS \nA. Overview \nGeoSnap created and owns and operates an  online photo platform on a globally \naccessible website: www.GeoSnap.com  (“Website”). (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). Photographers who \nregister with GeoSnap (“Photographers”) can us e the Website to upload photos they take \nat events (and in some instances, license to Website users). (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5).  Website users \ncan use the Website to search for, view, download (and in some cases, purchase licenses \nto) the photos. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5).  \nGeoSnap’s business model is dependent on its collection and use of the biometrics \nof the people depicted in its online photo platform. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). GeoSnap encourages \nevent participants to find photos of themselves by uploading a “selfie” and allowing its \nartificial intelligence to compare that photo with the others in its database. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). \nThis can only be done by extracting fr om each photo data representing the unique \ngeometry of each facial image so that comparisons can be made. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). Under \nBIPA, “scan[s] of . . . face geometry” are biometrics, 740 ILCS 14/10 . Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs argue, GeoSnap cannot collect or use such scans unless it complies with BIPA.  \nIn April 2019, GeoSnap contracted with Tough Mudder, an endurance event \ncompany, to allow Photographers to attend and take photographs of participants in \n \nseeking an extension of time to respond to the Amended Complaint to allow GeoSnap to provide time to \ninvestigate the additional plaintiff’s claims. (Docs. 60 and 61). On August 21, 2024, GeoSnap filed the instant \nmotion indicating that Gustafson’s claims are substantially similar to those raised by the original plaintiffs \nand do not impact the personal jurisdic tion arguments previously raised.  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 2 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>3 \n Tough Mudder events. (Doc. 58 ¶ 34). On August 24, 2019, Plaintiffs Adam and Regan \nMoomaw attended the “Tou gh Mudder Chicago Saturday” event held in Rockford, \nIllinois. (Doc. 58 ¶ 40). Plaintiff Sarah Gustafson attended Tough Mudder events held in \nRockford Illinois, in 2019, 2021, and 2022. (Doc. 58 ¶ 46). Thereafter, Plaintiffs used \nGeoSnap’s Website to locate pictures of themselves participating in the event. Plaintiffs \n“purchased” complimentary licenses to those photographs and downloaded the same, \nreceiving a receipt from GeoSnap.   \nB. GeoSnap \nGeoSnap is a proprietary limited company under the laws of Australia and is \nbased in Sydney, Australia. (Doc. 58 ¶ 10; Doc. 26-1 ¶¶ 2-3). GeoSnap does not maintain \na place of business in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnap does not employ anyone in Illinois. \n(Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnap does not own, lease, or occupy any property in Illinois, and it \ndoes not own any investments in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnap employs seven full-time employees, and none of those employees are based in Illinois. GeoSnap’s Website is \nnot hosted in Illinois and GeoSnap does not process photographs in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ \n3; Doc. 27 p. 3).  \nC. GeoSnap Website  \nGeoSnap.com is a globally accessible website created and owned and operated by \nGeoSnap. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). The Website includes an  online photo platform  that is operated Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 3 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>4 \n by GeoSnap. (Doc. 58 ¶ 4; Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). GeoSnap markets its platform  to both event \norganizers and photographers. (Doc. 58 ¶ 21).  \nD. Photographers3  \nPhotographers must register to use the Website. (Doc. 27-1 §§ 3, 4.1). Once \nregistered, Photographers may utilize GeoSnap’s Website services which include \n“[GeoSnap’s] event calendar, [GeoSnap’s] business name, [GeoSnap’s] relationship with \nevent organizers,” and “other Site services.” (Doc. 27-1, §§ 8.1, 8.3). Additionally, once \nregistered, Photographers may upload photos to the Website. (Doc. 27-1 § 8.3). For \nPhotographers to be able to upload photos, an “event organizer” (who is not a GeoSnap \nemployee) first must create an event on the Website. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 7). Alternatively, if an \nevent has not been created, Photographers may create the event themselves and invite \nother Photographers to attend the event. (Doc. 27-1, pg. 10 § 8.4).  \nPhotographers agree to GeoSnap’s Terms and Conditions by (1) registering for the \nWebsite (Doc. 27-1 § 4.1.5); (2) accessing the Website, using the Website, or using any \nservices available on the Website; (Doc. 27-1, § 1); (3) uploading  photos to the Website \n(Doc. 27-1 § § 4.2.10, 4.3); and (4) selling photos on the Website (Doc. 27-1 §§ 1, 4).  The \nTerms and Conditions also st ate that Photographers must read, understand, and agree to \nthe Terms and Conditions before selling photos on or using the Website. (Doc. 27-1, pg. \n2).  \n \n3 GeoSnap’s Terms and Conditions also refer to Photographers as “Sellers.” (Doc. 27-1).

GeoSnap Terms and Conditions \nPursuant to the Terms and Conditions, photographers agree to the following:  \n4.3 Use of the Content and Grant of License \nBy uploading Media Material to the Site the Seller has accepted these Terms \nand Conditions and agrees to  the following conditions:  \n 4.3.1. The Site and the Company will use your Media Material for the \npurpose of licensing your Media Material to customers of the Site in such formats as we may, from time to time make available to Customers, \nincluding without limiting the generality of the foregoing, via electronic \ndownload; \n 4.3.2. In connection with the foregoing, in addition to the licenses \nyou grant to the Site elsewhere in these Terms and Conditions, you grant to \nthe Site and the Company a non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, \nworldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, publish, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute copies of your Media Material; \n 4.3.3. The license includes the right for the Site to use screen \nresolution images and thumbnails of your Media Material for display and promotional purposes on the Site and any third-party sites, and in \nconnection with internet search results, and embeddable codes;  \n 4.3.4. Media Material will be licensed to customers by the Site in \naccordance with the Site Terms and Conditions in effect at the time. \n(Doc. 27-1 pp. 6-7).  \n8. Usage of the Site \n8.1. Sellers may have alternative photography business/brands that \nthey use. The Site supports the sellers ri ght for Sellers to carry on their own \nphotography businesses, however we do not allow you to use the Site services (our event calendar, our business name, our brand, our relationship with other photographers, our relationship with event \norganizers, or any other Site services) to compete with the Site or any \nservices that the Site provides. Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 5 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>6 \n 8.2. Many of the events on the Sites calendar of events are non-\nexclusive, there may be non-GeoSnap ph otographers at the event. If you \nbook onto a GeoSnap event you are deemed to be representing GeoSnap at \nthat event and you must upload photos  to the GeoSnap platform for sale. \nYou may not advertise that photos from a GeoSnap event are for sale through any other platform or service other than the Site. \n8.3. To upload photos to an event on the GeoSnap calendar you must \nbe a registered photographer for that event. The number of photographers who can upload from an event is determined by the event organizer. \n8.4. If the event is not on the Sites calendar you can create the event \non GeoSnap yourself. You can be a seller at that event and request other \nSellers (through the GeoSnap platform) to attend your event and upload \nphotos for sale if you choose. \n8.5. The Site events calendar is for the use of Sellers and is a service \nprovided by the Site for its Sellers and Users. The calendar information is \nto be used solely by Sellers to register onto and attend events as a GeoSnap photographer. The Site calendar should not be used for any other purpose \nincluding, but not limited to; finding events to attend as a non-GeoSnap \nphotographer. The Site calendar should not be used for any other purpose including, but not limited to; finding events to attend as a non-GeoSnap \nphotographer, passing calendar information to a different company, \ncopying, duplicating, linking to, redirecting to or otherwise using the \ninformation for any other purpose.  \n8.6. If you attend a GeoSnap event you cannot offer an alternative \npurchasing option for photos other than the Site. You cannot advertise your \nown website or other place to purchase the photos from the GeoSnap event \nother than the Site. \n8.7. Any photographer who has breached or is deemed by GeoSnap \nto have breached these terms may have their phot ographer account \nsuspended or terminated immediately at the sole discretion of GeoSnap \ninline with the “Termination” clause. \n8.8. Some Events and Event Organizers may require you to have a \nWorking with Children Check (WWCC) or similar document determined \nby your country or state to prove that you are certified to be working \naround minors). If you book on to an event that requires a WWC then you \nmust ensure that you have a valid WWCC, that it is up-to-date and present \na copy to the event organizer upon arrival at the event.

(Doc. 58 ¶ 4; Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5; Doc. 27-1 p. 3).5 \nIndividuals who pu rchase or license photos from the Website also agree to the Website’s \nterms and conditions. (Doc. 27-1 p. 8). The following terms and conditions are applicable \nto individuals who purchase or license photos from the Website (“Buyers”): \n6. Buyers \nBy purchasing Media Material from the Site you have understood, accepted \nand are bound by all these Terms and Conditions. \nFor clarity you have also read, understood and accepted all the Terms and \nConditions laid out for the Sellers. \nMedia Material viewed on the site is shown in low resolution. Upon \npurchase of Media Material you will be given a link to download the full resolution Media material to be sued solely for the purposes outlined in \nthese Terms and Conditions.  \nYou understand that by using the Site you may be exposed to Media \nmaterial that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. \nBy purchasing the Media Material you have accepted these Terms and \nConditions and agrees [sic] to the following: \n 6.1.1. By purchasing Media Material you are entering into an \nagreement with the Seller of the Med ia Material your purchase of that \nMedia Material gives you a non-tran sferable, non-resalab le, non-exclusive \nworld-wide license to the Media Material; \n6.1.2. You may not alter the purchased Media material in any way; \n \n4 When photos are licensed through the Website, GeoSnap receives 30% of the proceeds. (Doc. 58 ¶ 25).  \n \n5 Initially, photos are only viewable in a lower quality or format to that of the original photo. (Doc. 27-1 p. \n3). The original content is only accessible after the buyer successfully purchases or licenses the photos. (Doc. \n27-1 p. 3).  \n Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 7 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>8 \n 6.1.3. That agreement states that the Seller of the Media Material \nowns the exclusive world-wide copyright and the Media Material. \n6.1.4. You do not have the rights nor may you on-license, on-sell, re-\nsell, alter, modify, share, gift or use the Media material for marketing, \npromotional or sales purposes.

Failure to downloaded [sic] immediately will be the sole responsibility of the Buyer and no liability, \ncompensation or damages may be soug ht from the Company, the Site or \nthe Buyer.  \n(Doc. 27-1 pp. 8-9).  \nF. GeoSnap and Tough Mudder  \nIn 2019, GeoSnap contracted with Tough Mudder for Photographers to attend and \ntake photographs of participants in Tough Mudder events. (Doc. 58 ¶ 34). Tough Mudder \npromotes endurance events where participants  attempt 10-to-12-m ile-long obstacle \ncourses that feature hazards such as fields of mud and tanks of cold water. (Doc. 58 ¶ 35). \nIn an article promoting the partnership between GeoSnap and Tough Mudder, GeoSnap \nfounder and chief executive Andy Edwards (“Edwards”) emphasized that GeoSnap’s \nbiometric-based Selfie Search feature was central to the agreement. (Doc. 58 ¶ 37). As Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 8 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>9 \n Edwards stated in the article, because Tough Mudder participants “come out from the \nmuddy depths, face recognition is the only thing that will find photos of them.” (Doc. 58 \n¶ 37). In the same article, Edwards touted that the Tough Mudde r partnership would \nhelp GeoSnap realize “500% growth” in 2019. (Doc. 58 ¶ 38). Between August 2019 and \nDecember 2022, GeoSnap’s Website has hosted thousands of photographs from at least \neleven Tough Mudder events located in Illinois. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 52, 53).  \nG. Plaintiffs  \nOn August 24, 2019, Plaintiffs Adam and Regan Moomaw attended the “Tough \nMudder Chicago Saturday” event held in Rockford, Illinois. (Doc. 58 ¶ 40). At the event, \nphotographers took photographs of Plaintif fs and uploaded them to GeoSnap. (Doc. 58 \n¶¶ 42-43). During the upload process, GeoSnap extracted facial biometrics from the \nphotographs. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 41-42). The Moomaws were never informed that GeoSnap \nwould collect, store, or use their biometrics in the form of data representing the unique geometry of their facial im ages or that GeoSnap would profit from the use of their \nbiometrics by using them to enable the Selfie Search feature that facilitates the sale of \nphotographs through the Website. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 43-44). Regan  Moomaw later used the \nGeoSnap website to “purchase” and download complimentary licenses to the \nphotographs and was issued a receipt from GeoSnap (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 13, Doc. 27 p. 2). The \nreceipt confirmed that each photograph was from the “Tough Mudder Chicago \nSaturday” event. (Doc. 27-2).  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 9 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>10 \n Plaintiff Sarah Gustafson attended Tough Mudder events held in Rockford, \nIllinois, in 2019, 2021, and 2022. (Doc. 58, pg. 10). During the events, one or more \nphotographs containing Gustafson’s facial image were taken and subsequently uploaded \nto the GeoSnap website. ( Id.). Gustafson was never informed that GeoSnap would collect, \nstore, or use their biometrics in the form of  data representing the unique geometry of \ntheir facial images or that GeoSnap would pr ofit from the use of their biometrics by using \nthem to enable the Selfie Search feature that facilitates the sale of photographs through \nthe Website. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 49-50).  \nII. Personal Jurisdiction Order \nOn March 7, 2024, this Court found that it has personal jurisdiction over GeoSnap. \n(Doc. 38). The Court found, in pertinent part, specific jurisdiction exists because \nGeoSnap’s Website structured its commercial activity to invite business from Illinois. \nFurther, as the owner and operator of such a Website, GeoSnap stood “ready and willing” to do business with Illinois residents and then knowingly did business with Illinois \nresidents. The Court also found ample eviden ce demonstrating that GeoSnap reasonably \nshould have foreseen that it would be licensing, and in some cases selling, photographs \nfrom its online photo platform to Illinois residents such as the Plaintiffs.  \nThe Court rejected the contention that GeoS nap is merely a technology vendor and \nthat any contacts it has with Illinois are the result of a third party’s conduct and/or a \nWebsite user’s unilateral conduct. In so holding, the Court noted that, unlike the cases \nrelied on by GeoSnap, GeoSnap “was not merely involved in a one-off transaction with a \nthird party who, without GeoSnap’s knowledge, utilized GeoSnap’s technology in Illinois Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 10 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>11 \n for its own purposes.” (Doc. 38, pg. 15). Instead, “GeoSnap created and operated a self-\nhosted interactive website and allowed user s, including Illinois users, to engage in \ncommerce on that website. ( Id.). The Court also found GeoSnap’s contacts with Illinois \nwere the result of decisions made by GeoSnap, and that the contacts demonstrated \nGeoSnap “purposely exploited the Illinois market in a way that it should have reasonably \nforeseen its technology being used by, and its photographs being licensed to, Illinois \nresidents.” (Doc. 38, pgs. 17-18).  \nThe Court also considered the relationshi p between GeoSnap and Photographers \nattending Tough Mudder events as a basis for personal jurisdiction. The Court found that \nGeoSnap’s Terms and Conditio ns demonstrate the Photographers were acting as \nGeoSnap’s agents when they photographed events in Illinois and that the Photographers’ \nphysical presence in Illinois was attributable to GeoSnap. (Doc. 38, pg. 20). Accordingly, \nthe Court explained, the relationship between GeoSnap and the Photographers provided \nan alternative basis for establishing purposeful availment. \nIII. LEGAL STANDARD \nA. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b)  \nA court may reconsider an interlocutory order under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 54(b) . The Rule provides that any order that  does not resolve all claims as to \nall parties “may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the \nclaims and all the parties’ rights and liabilities.” F e d .  R .  C i v .  P .  5 4 ( b ) . Motions for \nreconsideration serve a limited function and are only granted where “the court has \npatently misunderstood a party or has made a decision outside the adversarial issues Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 11 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>12 \n presented to the Court by the parties or has made an error not of reasoning but of \napprehension.” Bank of Waunakee v. Rochester Cheese Sales, Inc.,  906 F.2d 1185, 1191 (7th Cir. \n1990) . “Such problems rarely arise and the motion to reconsider should be equally rare.” \nId.  \nThe purpose of allowing motions to reconsider is not “to enable a party to \ncomplete presenting his case after the court has ruled against him. Were such a procedure \nto be countenanced, some lawsuits really mi ght never end, rather than just seeming \nendless.” Frietsch v. Refco Inc ., 56 F.3d 825, 828 (7th Cir. 1995)  (refusing to consider \nargument that a party did not raise until after the court had dismissed the suit).  \nAdditionally, reconsideration “is not an approp riate forum for rehashing previously rejected \narguments.” Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole v. CBI Indus., Inc ., 90 F.3d 1264,  1270 (7th Cir. \n1996).  \nB. Personal Jurisdiction \n While there are two forms of jurisdiction, only specific jurisdiction is at issue here. \n“Specific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of issues deriving from, or connected \nwith, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.” Id. (citation and internal \nquotation marks omitted). Specific jurisdiction “may be condensed to three essential \nrequirements....” Felland v. Clifton , 682 F.3d 665, 673 (7th Cir. 2012) . First, the defendant's \ncontacts with the forum state must show th at it “purposefully availed [itself] of the \nprivilege of conducting business in the forum stat e or purposefully directed [its] activities \nat the state.” Id. (citation omitted). Second, the plaintiff's alleged injury must have arisen \nout of the defendant's forum-related activities. Id. Third, any exercise of personal Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 12 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>13 \n jurisdiction must “comport with traditio nal notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.” Id. (citations omitted). Here, GeoSnap ch allenges the Court’s finding at to the \nfirst element – purposeful availment.  \nIV.   DISCUSSION \nA. Purposeful Availment \n1. Purposeful Contacts Between GeoSnap and Illinois \n \nGeoSnap contends the Court erred in find ing that GeoSnap purposefully directed \nany activities toward Illinois. In support of this argument, GeoSnap argues the Court’s \nreliance on NBA Props., Inc. v. Hanwjh , 46 F.4th 614 (7th Cir. 2022)  (“NBA Properties ”) and \nCurry v. Revolution Labs., LLC ,, 949 F.3d 385, 399 (7th Cir. 2020)  (“Curry ”) was improper \nbecause these cases are factually dist inguishable from the instant case.  \nAccording to GeoSnap, Curry  is distinguishable because GeoSnap (1) did not ship \na physical product to Illinois, (2) had no way of knowing where Tough Mudder events \nwould occur, (3) had no control over where Tough Mudder events would take place, and \n(4) had no reason to know individuals attending Tough Mudder events in Illinois resided \nin Illinois. (Doc. 63, pgs. 6-7). GeoSnap raised these arguments in connection with its \noriginal motion to dismiss for lack of pers onal jurisdiction. (Doc. 33, pg. 4, arguing that \nCurry is “easily distinguishable because GeoSnap has no control over where the Tough \nMudder events would occur, does not use shipping addresses in Illinois, does not actually \ndeliver any ‘product’ in Illinois, and does not provide to [sic] a written acknowledgement \nto any Illinois consumers.”). Nonetheless, GeoSnap contends, it is proper to reassert the Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 13 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>14 same arguments in a motion to rec onsider because they were “mi stakenly overlooke d” \nby th e Court. (Doc. 63, pg. 7).  \nThe Court did not overlook these arguments; the y were discussed in the Original \nPJ Order (Doc. 38, pgs. 14-18), but consideration of additional jurisdictional facts led the \nCourt to conclude that GeoSnap reasonably should have foreseen tha t it would \nbe licensing (a nd in some ca ses selling)  photographs f rom its onlin e photo platform to \nIllinois residents. (Id.). GeoSnap may not n ow invoke Rule 54(b) to revisit a rguments \nthat have been pre viously raised and rejected. Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole v. CBI \nIndus., Inc., 90 F.3d 1264, 1270 (7th Cir. 1996) (“Reconsideration is not an \nappropriate forum for r ehashing previously rejected a rguments...”).  \nGeoSnap’s attempt to distinguish NBA Properties is also imprope r in the context of \na Rule 54(b)  motion.  Plai ntiffs’ response to GeoSnap’s original personal jurisdiction \nmotion extensi vely discusse d NBA Properties . (Doc. 27, pgs. 11-18). GeoSnap could have \npresented argume nt regarding NBA Properties  in its reply brief but chose not to. GeoSna p \ncannot now, for the first ti me in a motion for reconsideration, “raise arguments which \ncould, and should, have been made before [the order be ing challenged] issued.” FDIC v. \nMeyer , 781 F.2d 1260, 1268 (7th Cir. 1986) .  \nThe Court therefore rejects Ge oSnap’s ar guments regarding Curry  and NBA \nProp erties as being improperly raised in a motion to reconsider. That being said, \nGeoSnap’s rehashed arguments regarding Curry and be lated arguments regarding NBA \nProperties  fall flat. As the Court previously explai ned, “ [t]here is no per se requirement \nthat the defendant espe cially target the  forum in its business activity; it is sufficien t that Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 14 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>15 the defendant reasonably could foresee that its product would be sold in the forum. Curry \nv. Revolution Lab'ys, LLC, 949 F.3d 385, 399 (7th Cir. 2020) . Likewise, the claim that\nGeoSnap did not know each user’s address does not defeat personal jurisdiction because, \nat a minimum, Given GeoSnap’s purposeful busine ss activity, it has reason to know that \nit would be transacting business with individuals in Illinois.  \nGeoSnap contracted with Tough Mudder, an entity that has a market presence \nboth nationally and world-wide, including in Illinois, to provide its product – the online \nphoto array – to athletes attending Tough Mudd er events. GeoSnap held itself out as open \nfor business in Illinois by allowing photographers attending Tough Mudder events, including events in Illinois, to invite attendee s to use GeoSnap’s Website to license or \npurchase photographs from GeoSnap’s online photo array – in fact, participating photographers were prohibited from distributing event photographs on any other forum. \nThe photographs available on GeoSnap’s Webs ite were grouped by the date and location \nof the Tough Mudder event. For example, GeoSnap’s Website hosted over 22,000 photographs from an event identified as  “Tough Mudder Chicago 2022 Saturday.” When \na customer purchases or licenses a photograph hosted on GeoSnap’s Website, the receipt \nspecifies the date and locati on of the event where the phot ograph was taken. Given these \nfacts, GeoSnap can hardly complain it did not know some of its photographs would be licensed or purchased by Illinois residents. Therefore, it can be said that GeoSnap \nreasonably anticipated it would be licensing or selling its product to Illinois residents, \nsuch that GeoSnap purposefully availed itself of the benefits of doing business in Illinois. Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 15 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>16 The fact that a physical product was not shipped to Illinois does not alter the \nCourt’s analysis. See uBID, In c. v. GoDaddy Grp., Inc ., 623 F.3d 421, 429 (7th Cir.  2010) (fact \nthat physical product was not shipped to the forum does not defeat personal jurisdiction \nwhen contacts are otherwise sufficient). Nor does  the fact that GeoSnap did not charge \nfor licensing Tough Mudder photographs. Like the defendant in Howell v. Bumble, Inc., \nNo. 21 CV 6898, 2023 WL 6126492 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 19, 2023) , the aim of GeoSnap’s \npartnership with Tough Mudder was not to generate revenue from licensing photographs at Tough Mudder events, but to increase the company’s market share by \ngaining users who might eventually become paying customers. See Id. at *9-10 (finding \npersonal jurisdiction even though defendant di d not sell or ship products to the forum \nstate and noting that the defendant’s goal was to “gain users, preferably those who pay \nfor premium features…” and to “solicit ongoing use” of defendant’s dating app). \nThe Court also is not convinced by the co ntention that GeoSnap’s hosting of over \n22,000 photographs from a 2022 Illinois event is irrelevant because the Moomaw’s claims \narise from an event held in Illinois in 201 9. First, this argument was not raised in \nGeoSnap’s original motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and has been \nwaived. See Terese 396 F.Supp. 3d at 794. Second, the record reflects that the Website hosts \nphotos taken from eleven other Illinois ev ents, including the 2019 event the Moomaws \nattended. (Doc. 58, ¶ 52). Third, the Seventh Circuit has held that contacts arising after a \ncause of action accrues are relevant to the personal jurisdiction analysis. See \nLogan Prods., Inc. v. Optibase, Inc.,  103 F.3d 49, 53 (7th Cir. 1996) ; Dehmlow v. Austin  \nFireworks , 963 F.2d 941, 948 n.6 (7th Cir. 1992) .  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 16 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>17 \n Finally, GeoSnap contends the Court “overlooked” three cases cited in GeoSnap’s \nunderlying briefing: (1) Stein v. Clarifai , 526 F.Supp.3d 339 (N.D. Ill 2021) , Gutierrez v. \nWemagine.ai LLP , 2022 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14831 (N.D. Ill. 2022), and Webber v. Armslist LLC , \n70 F.4th 945 (7th Cir. 2023). But the fact that the Court did not expressly address every \nsingle case cited in GeoSnap’s initial briefing do es not mean those cases were overlooked. \nThe Court was not required to specifically address in its opinion each and every \nargument asserted by GeoSnap. In denying  GeoSnap’s motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction, the Court implicitly rejected GeoSnap’s arguments pertaining to \nthese decisions. Moreover, as highlighted in Plaintiffs’ briefing, Stein and Gutierrez are \ndistinguishable and not controlling. And, Webber is inapposite. GeoSnap contends that in \nWebber , the Seventh Circuit held that “designing a website that could be used in the forum \nstate” and “solict[ing] business in that state” is insufficient to create jurisdiction.” (Doc. \n63, pg. 9). Not so. As noted by Plaintiff, in Webber the issue was not whether the \ndefendant’s commercial website targeted the forum state, but whether the website’s \ncontacts with the forum could be attributed  to the website’s designer, a natural person \nsued individually.  \nIn summary, GeoSnap’s contacts clearly signal a willingness to do business with \nIllinois and indicate that GeoSnap reasonably should have anticipated that some of its \nphotographs would be licensed or purchased by Illinois consumers. GeoSnap’s \narguments on reconsideration are unavailing, and the Court finds sufficient contacts to \nsupport an exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over GeoSnap.  \n2. Relationship Between GeoSnap and the Photographers Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 17 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>24 \n GeoSnap, as the party seeking interlocuto ry review, bears the heavy burden of \npersuading the Court that “exceptional circu mstances justify a departure from the basic \npolicy of postponing appellate review until after the entry of a final judgment.”  Coopers \nv. Lybrand v. Livesay , 437 U.S. 463, 475 (1978) . The Seventh Circuit has cautioned that § \n1292(b)  must be used sparingly “lest interlocutory review increase the time and expense \nrequired for litigation,” Asher v. Baxter Int'l., Inc. , 505 F.3d 736, 741 (7th Cir. 2007) , and \nthat interlocutory appeals are “frowned  on in the federal judicial system,” Sterk v. Redbox \nAutomated Retail , LLC, 672 F.3d 535, 536 (7th Cir. 2012) .  \nAs noted above, to certify an order for interlocutory appeal under § 1292(b)  there \nmust be “a question of law, it must be controlling , it must be contestable , and its resolution \nmust promise to speed up  the litigation.” Ahrenholz v. Bd. Of Trs.,  219 F.3d 674, 675 (7th \nCir. 2000)  (emphasis in original). The criteria are “conjunctive, not disjunctive,” therefore, \nthe Court should not grant a motion to certify if the movant does not meet its burden as \nto any one of these criteria. Id. at 676 .  \nGeoSnap contends that requirements under § 1292 are met. Specifically, GeoSnap \ncontends that personal jurisdiction is a qu estion of law that has the potential to be \ndispositive and is therefore a controlling question of law. GeoSnap further contends that, \ngiven the facts of this case, whether personal jurisdiction exists is contestable and \nresolution of the question in GeoSnap’s favor could prevent protracted litigation.  \nHere, the Court’s analysis begins and ends with section 1292(b)’s first requirement. \nTo be a “question of law” as used in section 1292(b), the question must be a “pure” \nquestion of law, “something the court of appeals could decide quickly and cleanly Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 24 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>25 \n without having to study the record,” such as “a question of the meaning of a statutory or \nconstitutional provision, regulation, or common law doctrine ...” Id. at 676–\n677. Application of a legal standard is a question of law. In re Text Messaging Antitrust \nLitigation,  630 F.3d at 626 . However, the determination here does not involve a pure \nquestion of law. Instead, it involves mixed questions of law and fact concerning \nGeoSnap’s conduct and its contacts with Illinois.  \nGeoSnap insists this case involves a pure question of law because GeoSnap “is \narguing that the Court’s legal conclusions drawn from the facts in the record were \nincorrect and contrary to well-established precedent from this Circuit.” (Doc. 63, pg. 17). \nGeoSnap further argues that this Court’s opin ion is at odds with other district court \nopinions that “declined personal jurisdiction and are closer to the facts in this case than \n[the facts in] the cases cited by the Court. GeoSnap’s supplemental briefing further details \nhow the facts of this case are similar to other cases where personal jurisdiction has been \ndeclined and dissimilar to other cases where courts found that the exercise of personal \njurisdiction was proper. (Doc. 75).  \nBut these arguments only serve to demons trate that GeoSnap’s alleged question of \nlaw is inextricably intertwined with an analysis of the factual allegations in this case. The \ndetermination here necessarily requires examination of the facts. Indeed, resolving \nGeoSnap’s initial motion to dismiss and its subsequent motion for reconsideration, \nrequired an extensive review of the relevant jurisdictional facts. The same will be true for \nthe Seventh Circuit; determining whether GeoSnap’s contacts with Illinois are sufficient \nto establish personal jurisdiction will necessarily require the Appellate Court to dig Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 25 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>26 \n through the record, re viewing facts, Terms and Conditions, and declarations. See e.g.,  \nShepherd Investments Int'l, Ltd. v. Verizon Commc'ns, Inc. , No. 03C0703, 2005 WL 1475323, \nat *2 (E.D. Wisc. June 22, 2005)  (finding that review of person al jurisdiction order did not \ninvolve an abstract legal issue because the court of appeals would have to “study the \nrecord, decide which facts were relevant and measure the facts against a somewhat \nimprecise legal standard, that of minimum contacts.”); Burton v. American Cyanamid , Case \nNo. 07-CV-0303, 2016 WL 311286, at *3 (E.D. Wis. Jan. 26, 2016)  (finding that “the \npurposeful availment inquiry requires the application of facts to a legal standard and \nthus is not a pure question of law.”).  \nUnder these circumstances, GeoSnap cannot meet the standard for a “question of \nlaw” ripe for appellate review under § 1292. Because all four criteria must be satisfied in \norder to certify an order for immediate appeal under § 1292(b) , and at least one is not \nsatisfied, the Court need not address the remaining criteria. See Ahrenholz , 219 F.3d at 675 . \n2. Jurisdictional Discovery \nIn support of its argument for jurisdictional discovery, GeoSnap first contends the \nCourt erred by “prioritize[ing] inferences it drew from GeoSnap’s Te rms and Conditions \nover GeoSnap’s Declaration.” (Doc. 63, pg. 17). But, on a motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction, district courts must resolve all factual disputes in plaintiff’s favor; \nonly unrefuted facts in a defendant’s declaration will be taken as true.  Northern Grain \nMarketing, LLC v. Greving,  743 F.3d 487, 491 (7th Cir.2014) ; GCIU-Emp. Ret. Fund v . \nGoldfarb Corp.,  565 F.3d 1018, 1020  n. 1 (7th Cir. 2009). Thus, to the extent there is a dispute \nbetween GeoSnap’s declaration and the Terms and Conditions (the affirmative evidence Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 26 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>27 \n supporting the exercise of jurisdiction), the Court properly resolved that dispute in \nPlaintiff’s favor.  \nNext, GeoSnap criticizes the Court for noting that “the declaration of the parties is \nnot controlling where the conduct of the partie s demonstrates the existence of an agency \nrelationship.” (Doc. 38, pg. 20 n.14) (citing McNerney v. Allamuradov, 84 N.E.3d 437, 454 \n(Ill. App. Ct. 2017) . GeoSnap contends that, at this ea rly stage and without the presence \nof a counter-declaration, it was improper to rely on this case because McNerney  was \ndecided on summary judgment on a more fully developed record. GeoSnap misconstrues \nthe Court’s Order. The Court’s citation to McNerney is not intended to refer to a \n“declaration” under 28 U.S.C. § 1746 . Rather, the Court was emphasizing that, if the \nconduct of the parties demonstrates an agency relationship, the fact that the parties’ \ncontract disavowed an agency relationship by “declaring” no such relationship exists is \nnot determinative.  \nFinally, GeoSnap’s citation to B.D. ex rel. Myer v. Samsung SDI Co., 91 F.4th 856, 859 \n(7th Cir. 2024) for the proposition that the Court erred in denying the motion to dismiss \nwithout allowing for jurisdictional discovery is unpersuasive. In B.D. , the district court \nrelied primarily on the stream-of-commerce theory to find specific jurisdiction. Id. at 862 . \nThe Seventh Circuit chose to remand the case for jurisdictional discovery because (1) the \nparties agreed that the defendant sold some products, but not the product in issue (18650 \nbatteries), directly to the forum (Indiana), and (2) although the record indicated \ndefendant sold 18650 batteries to Indiana consumers through third-party websites and \nvendors, whether the defendant knew or expected that these third parties would cause Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 77     Filed 03/06/25     Page 27 of 28     Page ID\n#<pageID>28the product to enter Indiana was uncle ar. Id. at 863. But the same issue i s not present in \nthis case. GeoSnap was not transactin g business with users via a third party,  and thus \nthere is no question rega rding whethe r GeoSnap knew that a third par ty would cause \nits product to enter Illinois. Rather , given GeoSnap’s purposeful conduct (as \npreviously describe d herein), Plaintiff has made a prima facie showing that \nspecific personal jurisdiction exists.\nV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves plaintiffs Adam Moomaw, Regan Moomaw, and Sarah Gustafson who filed a class-action lawsuit against GeoSnapShot PTY LTD, alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to the collection and use of their biometric data without proper consent. The case focuses on whether GeoSnapShot, which uses AI to match event participants' photos for sale, can compel arbitration based on waivers signed for Tough Mudder events, where the photos were taken. The court denied GeoSnapShot's motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of contract formation issues and technicalities in the agreements, along with insufficient evidence to demonstrate users agreed to its terms.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether GeoSnapShot, a non-signatory to the liability waiver agreements signed for Tough Mudder events, can compel arbitration or dismissal of the claims based on being a third-party beneficiary to the agreements.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied GeoSnapShot's motion to compel arbitration, finding that GeoSnapShot, as a non-signatory, could not enforce the arbitration clauses within the liability agreements because those clauses did not directly benefit GeoSnapShot or indicate an intent to benefit non-signatories like GeoSnapShot.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: In simple terms, this case is about whether a company, GeoSnap, which scans people's faces in photos using AI, can make the people sue somewhere else or not at all, because they signed a form when they joined a Tough Mudder event. The court said no, because GeoSnap wasn't directly mentioned to benefit from those forms, so the people can continue their lawsuit in this court.",

OVERVIEW \nGeoSnap is an online platform (“Website”) that allows registered photographers \n(“Photographers”) to attend events, upload  their photos to the Website, and receive a \n \n1 Defendants removed this action from the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, Illinois pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§§ 1332 , 1441, 1446, and 1453.  \n Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 1 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>2 \n commission (shared with GeoSnap) on the phot os that are sold through the website. (Doc. \n58, ¶ 4).  \nGeoSnap’s business model is dependent on its collection and use of the biometrics \nof the people depicted in its online photo platform. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). GeoSnap encourages \nevent participants to find photos of themselves by uploading a “selfie” and allowing its \nartificial intelligence to compare that photo with the others in its database. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). \nThis can only be done by extracting fr om each photo data representing the unique \ngeometry of each facial image so that comparisons can be made. (Doc. 58 ¶ 5). \nIn April 2019, GeoSnap contracted with Tough Mudder, an endurance event \ncompany, to allow Photographers to attend and take photographs of participants in \nTough Mudder events. (Doc. 58 ¶ 34). Tough Mudder promotes endurance events in \nwhich participants attempt 10 to 12 mile-long obstacle courses that feature hazards such \nas fields of mud and tanks of cold water. (Doc. 58 ¶ 35). In an article promoting the \npartnership, GeoSnap founder and chief executive Andy Edwards emphasized that \nGeoSnap’s biometric-based Selfie Search feature was central to the agreement. Because \nTough Mudder participants “come out from  the muddy depths,” the article quoted \nEdwards as saying, “face recognition is the only thing that will find photos of them.” \n(Doc. 58 ¶ 37). In the same article, Edwards touted the Tougher Mudder partnership as \none that would help GeoSnapShot realize “500% growth” in 2019. (Doc. 58 ¶ 38).  \nOn August 24, 2019, Plaintiffs Adam and Regan Moomaw attended the “Tough \nMudder Chicago Saturday” event held in Rockford, Illinois. (Doc. 58 ¶ 40). Plaintiff Sarah \nGustafson attended Tough Mudder events held in Rockford Illinois, in 2019, 2021, and Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 2 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>3 \n 2022. (Doc. 58 ¶ 46). As is relevant to GeoSnap’s arbitration argument, GeoSnap contends \nPlaintiffs executed waiver agreements when they signed up to compete in the Tough \nMudder competitions. (Doc. 62, 62-1).  \nGeoSnap has provided the Court with  copies of five waiver agreements \npurportedly executed by Plaintiffs. Three of the agreements were executed prior to 2021 \n(one each for Adam Moomaw, Regan Moomaw, and Sarah Gustafson relating to the 2019 \nTough Mudder event in Rockford, Illinois) (“Pre-2021 Agreements). (Doc. 62-1). The \nremaining two waiver agreements were executed by Sarah Gustafson in 2021 and 2022 \n(relating to Gustafson’s participation in the 2021 and 2022 Tough Mudder events in \nRockford, Illinois) (“Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements”). (Doc. 62-1). The Pre-2021 \nAgreements include a choice of law provision designating the law “in the State in which \nthe TM Event is held” as controlling, while the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements \ndesignate Delaware law as controlling. (Doc. 62-1).  \nDuring the events, one or more photog raphs containing Plaintif fs’ facial images \nwere taken and subsequently uploaded to the Website. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 41, 47). After the \nphotographs containing Plaintiffs’ facial images were uploaded to the Website, GeoSnap \nscanned them and extracted data representing the unique geometry of Plaintiffs’ facial \nimages. (Doc. 58 ¶¶ 42, 48). GeoSnap profited from the use of Plaintiffs’ biometrics by \nusing them to enable the Selfie Search feature that facilitates the sale of photographs \nthrough the Website, and in turn generates GeoSnap’s primary source of revenue. (Doc. \n58 ¶¶ 44, 50).  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 3 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>4 \n Under BIPA, “scan[s] of . . . face geometry” are biometrics, 740 ILCS 14/10 . \nPlaintiffs argue GeoSnap cannot collect or use such scans unless it complies with BIPA. \nPlaintiffs seek statutory liquidated damages for each of several alleged technical \nviolations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/5  et seq.  \nGeoSnap contends that, pursuant to the waiver agreements Plaintiffs purportedly \nexecuted with Tough Mudder, Plaintiffs agreed to “(1) mediation or arbitration for ‘all \ndisputes, controversies or claims arising ou t of [Plaintiffs’] participation of the [Tough \nMudder event…’; and (2) waive the right to proceed as a class action.” (Doc. 62). \nAlthough GeoSnap is a non- signatory to the waiver agreements, it seeks to compel \narbitration based on its alleged third-party beneficiary status. Alternatively, to the extent \nPlaintiffs do not have to arbitrate their claims, GeoSnap seeks to dismiss all or part of \ntheir First Amended Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) . \n(Doc. 62).   \nII. DISCUSSION – MOTION TO COMPEL ARBITRATION \nA. Legal Standard \nThe Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) mandates that courts enforce valid, written \narbitration agreements.  Tinder v. Pinkerton Sec. , 305 F.3d 728, 733 (7th Cir. 2002)  (citing 9 \nU.S.C. § 2). This mandate reflects a federal policy that favors arbitration and “places \narbitration agreements on equal f ooting with all other contracts.” Buckeye Check Cashing, \nInc. v. Cardegna , 546 U.S. 440, 443 (2006) .  Arbitration should be compelled under the FAA \nwhen “three elements are present: (1) an enforceable written agreement to arbitrate, (2) a Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 4 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>5 \n dispute within the scope of the arbitration agreement, and (3) a refusal to arbitrate.”  A.D. \nv. Credit One Bank, N.A. , 885 F.3d 1054, 1060 (7th Cir. 2018)  (citing 9 U.S.C. §§ 3–4).   \nCourts deciding motions to compel arbitration apply \na summary judgment standard under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 . See Tinder v. \nPinkerton Sec. , 305 F.3d 728, 735 (7th Cir. 2002) . “A district court may conclude as a matter \nof law that parties did or did not enter into an arbitration agreement only if no genuine \ndispute of material fact exists as  to the formation of the agreement.” Wallrich v. Samsung \nElecs. Am., Inc ., 106 F.4th 609, 618 (7th Cir. 2024) . The party seeking to compel arbitration \n“bears the initial burden to show that an arbitration agreement exists.” Id.  \nB. Background  \nPrior to competing in the Tough Mu dder events alleged in the Amended \nComplaint (Doc. 58), Plaintiffs were required to execute a liability agreement. As \npreviously noted, Adam Moomaw, Regan Moomaw, and Sarah Gustafson purportedly executed liability agreements prior to attending the 2019 Tough Mudder event in \nRockford, Illinois (Pre-2021 Agreements”). (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 8-31). In addition, Sarah \nGustafson purportedly executed two liability agreements prior to attending the 2021 and \n2022 Tough Mudder events in Rockford, Illinois (“Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements”). \n(Doc. 62-1, pgs. 32-43).   \nAll five liability agreements include an arbitration provision wherein Plaintiffs \nagreed to (1) mediation or arbitration for, “all disputes, controversies or claims arising \nout of [Plaintiffs’] participation of the [Tough Mudder] event…”; and (2) waive the right \nto proceed as a class action. (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 10, 18, 25, 34, 40). The Pre-2021 Agreements Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 5 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>6 \n include a choice of law provision providing for application of the law “in the State in \nwhich the TM Event is held.” (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 10, 18, 26). The Gustafson 2021/2022 \nAgreements include a choice of law provision providing for the application of Delaware \nlaw. (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 34, 40). GeoSnap admits th at it is a non-signatory to the liability \nagreements but claims that, as a third-party be neficiary, it may enforce the arbitration \nprovisions contained therein.   \nC. Analysis  \n Plaintiffs dispute that they contracted to arbitrate claims with GeoSnap. Thus, \nbefore determining whether the arbitration provisions apply to Plaintiffs’ claims or \nwhether that very question itself is delegat ed to the arbitrator, the Court must first \ndetermine whether a valid contract exists. Ge oSnap contends that an arbitrator, not the \nCourt, must decide whether such an agreem ent exists. GeoSnap’s view is mistaken; it \nconflates the question of contract formation wi th the question of co ntract enforceability.  \nAs the Seventh Circuit explained recently in K.F.C. v. Snap, Inc. , “judges must \ndecide that a contract has been formed before they may order \narbitration.” K.F.C. v. Snap Inc. , 29 F.4th 835, 837 (7th Cir. 2022) ; accord  Janiga v. Questar \nCap.

This is \nbecause, “[e]ven the most sweeping delegation cannot send the contract- formation  issue \nto the arbitrator, because, until the court rule s that a contract exists, there is simply no \nagreement to arbitrate.” K.F.C. , 29 F.4th at 837  (emphasis added).

See, e.g., CCC Info. Servs. Inc. v. Tractable Inc. , 2019 WL 2011092 at \n*2 (N.D. Ill. May 7, 2019)  (whether a non-signatory defend ant could enforce an arbitration \nagreement was a question of contract formation that must be decided by the Court \nbecause it pertained to whether an agreement “exist[ed] at all”), aff'd, 36 F.4th 721 (7th \nCir. 2022) . Cf. K.F.C.  29 F.4th at 838 (because Illinois law treats contracts entered into by \nchildren as voidable rather than void, argument that it would be against public policy to \nenforce arbitration agreement against non- signatory minor concerned the agreement’s \n“validity, not its existence,” and was therefore a question for the arbitrator). Thus, in the \ninstant case, the Court finds that whether Ge oSnap, as a non-signatory, can enforce the \nsubject arbitration agreements is  a question of contract formation that must be decided \nby the Court.  \nNext, the Court must determine what body of law governs whether a contract \nexists. To the extent GeoSnap contends the FAA controls, GeoSnap is mistaken; state law \ngoverns the issue of contract formation. See Arthur Andersen v. Carlisle , 556 U.S. 624, 630 \n(2009)  (The FAA does “not alter background principles of state contract law regarding \nthe scope of agreements”—“including the question of who is bound by them.”). See also \nSosa v. Onfido, Inc. , 8 F.4th 631, 637 (7th Cir. 2021)   (A “nonparty's right to enforce an \narbitration agreement is governed by state law.”); Janiga v. Questar Cap. Corp. , 615 F.3d \n735, 742 (7th Cir. 2010)  (“[C]ontract formation is governed by state law.”). As to which \nState’s substantive law controls, a federal court sitting in diversity applies the choice-of-Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 7 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>8 \n law rules of the forum state Wachovia Sec., LLC v. Banco Panamericano, Inc ., 674 F.3d 743 \n(7th Cir. 2012)  (internal citations omitted). So, Illinois choice-of-law rules determine what \nlaw governs the contract formation issue.  \nBut, as is explained more fully below, the Court need not engage in a lengthy \nchoice-of-law analysis. As previously noted, the Pre-2021 Agreements provide for the \napplication of the law in the State where the Tough Mudder event was held (in this case, \nIllinois), and the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements provide for the application of \nDelaware law. In a footnote, GeoSnap notes that the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements \nprovide for application of Delaware law. GeoSnap, however, does not discuss the Pre-\n2021 Agreements, including whether Pre-2021 Agreements contain a choice-of-law \nprovision.2 \nAt first glance, the substantive law of both Delaware and Illinois appear to be in \nplay. Plaintiff advocates for application of Illinois law and GeoSnap, albeit briefly, \nreferences a Delaware choice-of-law clause in the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements. But \n \n2 This is GeoSnap’s second motion to compel arbitration. In its first motion to compel arbitration (Doc. 45), which \nwas mooted by the filing of Plaintiff’s First Amended Complaint (Doc. 58), GeoSnap argued for the application of Delaware law. At the time, Adam Moomaw and Regan Moomaw  were the only plaintiffs. GeoSnap argued that the \nMoomaw’s Pre-2021 Agreements included a choice of la w provision requiring the application of Delaware law. \nGeoSnap argued that, under Illinois law, as a non-signatory it could not enforce the arbitration provision in the \nMoomaw’s Pre-2021 Agreements, but under Delaware law Ge oSnap, as a non-signatory, could enforce the arbitration \nprovision. GeoSnap further argued that, given the choice of law provision in the Pre-2021 Agreements, the Court was \nrequired to apply the law of Delaware. Plaintiffs res ponded, noting that the Moomaw’s Pre-2021 Agreements did not \ncontain a choice-of-law clause  providing for the application of Delaware law. (Doc. 50). In fact, the Moomaw’s Pre-\n2021 Agreements included a provision providing  for the application of the law “in the State in which the TM Event is \nheld.” (Doc. 50, pgs. 8-9). In other words, Illinois law. Thereafter, GeoSnap filed a reply admitting that Plaintiffs were \ncorrect and alleging that the mistake was due to counsel inadvertently reviewing a diffe rent version of Tough Mudder’s \nliability agreement. (Doc. 51).  \n Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 8 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>9 \n GeoSnap’s briefing does not present any argument addressing the choice of law issue.3 \nFurther, both GeoSnap and Plaintiffs rely on Illinois law in their briefing. Therefore, to \nresolve the contract formation issue, the Court applies Illinois law. See Brunswick Leasing \nCorp. v. Wisconsin Cent ., Ltd., 136 F.3d 521, 525-26 (7th Cir. 1998)  (if neither party argues \nthat the forum state’s choice of law rules require the application of another state’s \nsubstantive law, then the substantive law of the forum state governs). \nThat being said, even if the Court were to conduct a choice-of-law analysis, the \nchoice-of-law provisions in the liability agreements would not control. Under \nIllinois choice-of-law rules, which follow the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts (1977), \ncourts will enforce a choice-of-law clause contained in the contract – when a valid \ncontract has been formed. See Kohler v. Leslie Hindman, Inc ., 80 F.3d 1181, 1185 (7th Cir. \n1996)  (“In disputes such as this one that arise from a contract, Illinois law respects the \ncontract's choice-of-law clause as long as the contract is valid .”) (emphasis added).  \nIn the instant case, Plaintiffs contend th ey did not enter into a contract with \nGeoSnap. When contract formation is in issue, applying the choice-of-law clause \ncontained in the disputed contract would assume the answer to the antecedent question of whether a contract was formed is yes. See e.g.,  Kaufman v. Am. Express Travel Related \nServs. Co., Inc. , No. 07 C 1707, 2008 WL 687224, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 7, 2008)  (“as an \n \n3 As noted above, in its initial motion to compel, GeoSnap argued for the application of Delaware law, which according \nto GeoSnap, allows non-signatories to a contract to co mpel arbitration under the contr act. In the instant motion, \nalthough GeoSnap claims the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements include a Delaware choice of law provision, GeoSnap \ndoes not advocate for the application of Delaware law. Th e Court therefore concludes that GeoSnap has abandoned \nthis argument, and to the extent that  it has not, the argument is waived. See Rock Hemp Corp. v. Dunn , 51 F.4th 693, \n704 (7th Cir. 2022) (“[P]erfunctory and undeveloped arguments, as well as arguments that are unsupported by \npertinent authority, are waived.”).

Only if the court finds a valid contract may it turn to the choice of \nlaw provision in the Agreement....”). See also e.g., Sosa v. Onfido, Inc ., No. 1:20 CV 04247, \n2021 WL 38141, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 5, 2021) , aff'd, 8 F.4th 631  (7th Cir. 2021) (when contract \nformation is in issue, it would be inappropriate to apply a choice-of-law provision \nbecause “the antecedent question of whether that document applies to the parties [has \nnot been resolved]”). Thus, if the Court were to conduct a choice-of-law analysis, any \nchoice-of-law provision would yield to the law of Illinois, which has adopted the “most \nsignificant relationship test” for deciding among conflicting laws. See Purcell & Wardrope \nChartered v. Hertz Corp.,  175 Ill.App.3d 1069, 125 Ill.Dec. 585, 530 N.E.2d 994, 1001 (Ill. \nApp. 1988) .  \nHaving resolved the threshold choice-of-law questions, the Court turns to whether \nGeoSnap, as a non-signatory to the liability agreements, has standin g to require Plaintiffs \nto arbitrate. GeoSnap asserts that it has a right to enforce the arbitration provisions \nbecause it is a third-party beneficiary to the Agreements. GeoSnap claims the Agreements apply broadly to “Released Parties.” The Pre-2021 Agreements (relating to Adam \nMoomaw, Regan Moomaw, and Gustafson’s attendance at the 2019 event in Rockford, \nIllinois) define “Released Parties” as “Tough-Mudder Incorporated and its directors, \nofficers, employees, agents, contractors, insurers, spectators, co-participants, equipment \nsuppliers, and volunteers.” (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 8, 16, 24). The Gustafson 2021/2022 \nAgreements (relating to Gustafson’s participation in Tough Mudder events in 2021 and Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 10 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>11 \n 2022 in Rockford, Illinois) define “Released Parties” as “OCR US Holdings, LLC d/b/a \nTough Mudder (“TM”) and its parent Spartan Race, Inc. (“Spartan”) and their respective \naffiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, insurers, spectators, co-\nparticipants, equipment suppliers, and volunteers.”(Doc. 62-1, pgs. 24, 32). The Pre-2021 \nAgreements incorporate Released Parties in to the term “Tou gh Mudder,” but the \n2021/2022 Gustafson Agreements do not incorporate Released Parties into the term \n“Tough Mudder.” Instead, the terms of the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements sometimes \ninclude “other Released Parties” and sometimes do not. (Doc. 62-1, pgs. 32-43). \nGeoSnap contends that it is a Released Party because “[e]ssentially, Released \nParties would apply to anyone or any compan y that had anything to do with the Tough \nMudder event.” (Doc. 62, pg. 10). Additionally, GeoSnap contends the Affiliate \nPartnership Agreement it entered with Tough Mudder Incorporated demonstrates that \nthe companies have a direct affiliate relationship. (Doc. 62-2).  \nPlaintiffs contend GeoSnap cannot be a third-party beneficiary because the \narbitration clauses contained in the Pre-2021 and Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements do \nnot refer to Released Parties or otherwise su ggest that it applies to or benefits Released \nParties.4  Additionally, Plaintiffs contend that GeoSnap’s third-party beneficiary \n \n4 Plaintiffs also contend that the terms of the Pre-2021 Agreements indicate that all Released Parties have substantial \ncontrol over how Tough Mudder events are operated. Plaintiffs  contend this conflicts with  GeoSnap’s prior declaration \nunder penalty of perjury declaring that “GeoSnap [does not] ha[ve] any role in…the promotion of [Tough Mudder] events, the enrollment of part icipants in those events, or  the operation of the events.” (Doc. 26-1, ¶ 10). Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs argue, GeoSnap is judicially estopped from clai ming it is a released Party. Because the Court finds that \nGeoSnap is not entitled to enforce the arbitration provisions in the Agreements, the Court need not address this \nargument. However, the Court notes that Released Parties includes groups that clearly do not exercise substantial \ncontrol over Tough Mudder or its events, including spectat ors, co-participants, and volunteers. Thus, the Court \nquestions the validity of this argument.  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 11 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>12 \n argument fails as to Gustafson because her agreements were executed on October 11, \n2018, August 5, 2021, and August 17, 2022, and the Affiliate Partnership Agreement was \nnot in effect when Gustafson executed her agreem ents. Further, Plaintiff notes that the \nlatter two agreements do not mention the entity that GeoSnap contracted with (Tough \nMudder Incorporated); they refer instead to “OCR US HOLDINGS, LLC d/b/a Tough \nMudder…and its parent SPARTAN RACE, INC.”  \n“A nonsignatory to a contract typically has no right to invoke an arbitration \nprovision contained in that contract.” Sosa v. Onfido , Inc., 8 F.4th 631, 639 (7th Cir. 2021)  \n(applying Illinois law). Generally, under Illinois law, only signatories to an arbitration \nagreement can move to compel arbitration. See Bishop v. We Care Hair Dev. Corp. , 738 \nN.E.2d 610, 619 (Ill. App. Ct. 2000) . But Illinois law recognizes exceptions to that general \nrule, under theories involving third-party beneficiaries, agency, and equitable \nestoppel. Id. (citing Ervin v. Nokia, Inc. , 714, 812 N.E.2d 534, 539–41 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004) ). \nIllinois law distinguishes between intended and incidental beneficiaries. Hacker v. Shelter \nInsurance Co.,  902 N.E.2d 188 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009) . An intended beneficiary is intended by \nthe parties to the contract to directly bene fit for the performance of the agreement; under \nthe contract an intended beneficiary has rights and may sue. Id. An incidental beneficiary \nhas no rights and may not sue to enforce them. Id.  “Illinois courts ... ‘recognize a strong \npresumption against conferring contractual benefits on noncontracting third parties.’ \n” Sosa, 8 F.4th at 639 , quoting  117 N.E.3d 1155, 1159 (Ill. App. Ct. 2018) . See also Coatney v. \nAncestry.com DNA, LLC,  93 F.4th 1014 (7th Cir. 2024 ) (describing the basis for third-Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 12 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>13 \n party beneficiary arguments as “shaky legal ground”). To overcome that presumption, \nas explained by the Seventh Circuit: \nIt is not enough to show that the part ies know, expect, or even intend that \nothers will benefit from the agreement. Instead, for a nonparty to qualify as \na third-party beneficiary, the language of  the contract must show that the \ncontract was made for the direct, not merely incidental, benefit of the third \nperson. This intention must be shown by an express provision in the contract identifying the third-party beneficiary by name or by description \nof a class to which the third party belongs. \n \nSosa, 8 F.4th at 639  (quotations omitted) (citing Marque Medicos Farnsworth, LLC , 117 \nN.E.3d 1155 (Ill. App. Ct. 2018) ; Martis v. Grinnell Mut. Reinsurance Co. , 905 N.E.2d 920, \n924 (Ill. App. Ct. 2009) ). Further, a third-party beneficiary can only enforce an arbitration \nagreement when “the signatories to the agreement intended that the nonsignatories were \nto derive benefits from the agreement and where the arbitration clause itself is \nsusceptible to this interpretation…” Dannewitz v. Equicredit Corp. of Am ., 775 N.E.2d 189, \n192 (Ill. App. Ct. 2002) . \nApplying the principles set forth above, the Court looks to the language in the \nliability agreements to determine whether GeoSnap was an intended beneficiary. The \nCourt need not spend long on its analysis. A review of the arbitration clauses in the Pre-2021 Agreements and the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements demonstrates that, even if \nGeoSnap is a Released Party, the arbitration clauses in the liability agreements do not \nindicate, in any way, an intent to benefi t Released Parties. Pursuant to its terms, the \narbitration provisions encompass “disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of my \n(and/or my participating minor child/ward’s participation in the TM Events.” (Doc. 62-\n1, pgs. 10, 18, 26, 40, 34-35). The arbitration clauses are silent as to nonparties, including Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 13 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>14 \n Released Parties, and there is no other language indicating that the arbitration provisions \nwere intended to directly benefit GeoSnap or “Released Parties.” Because the clauses \nthemselves cannot be interpreted as conferring a direct benefit on GeoSnap, Released \nParties,5 or any other nonparty, GeoSnap cannot compel Plaintiffs to arbitrate. Coatney, \n93 F.4th at 1024 (quoting Johnson v. Noble , 608 N.E.2d 537, 541 (Ill. App. Ct. 1992) . See also \nWashington v.

DISCUSSION - MOTION TO DISMISS \nA. Legal Standard \nA defendant is entitled to dismissal only wh ere “it appears beyond doubt that the \nplaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his or her claim on which relief may be \ngranted.” Hickey v. O'Bannon,  287 F.3d 656, 657 (7th Cir.2002)  (affirming dismissal), \nciting Szumny v. American General Finance, Inc.,  246 F.3d 1065, 1067 (7th Cir.2001) ; \n \n5 Notably, pursuant to the liability agreements, “Released Parties” includes, among others, spectators and co-\nparticipants. Thus, to construe the arbitration clause as applicable to all “Released Parties” would lead to the untenable conclusion that even spectators or other partic ipants could enforce the arbitration provision. \n. \n6 Plaintiffs contend GeoSnap’s third-pa rty beneficiary argument “has yet anot her shortcoming specific to Plaintiff \nSarah Gustafson.” (Doc. 65, pgs. 11-12). Specifically, GeoSnap claims that, given its aff iliate Partnership Agreement \nwith Tough Mudder Incorporated, it is a “Released Party” under all of the liability agreements. The Affiliate \nPartnership Agreement, however, was not  in effect when Gustafson executed her liability agreem ents with Tough \nMudder. Additionally, the Gustafson 2021/2022 Agreements do not reference the entity that GeoSnap contracted with \n(Tough Mudder Incorporated). Instead, they refer to OCR US HOLDINGS, LLC d/b/a/ Tough Mudder…and its parent \nSPARTAN RACE, Inc.” These facts provide an additional inde pendent basis for finding that GeoSnap cannot compel \nGustafson to arbitrate.

Section 15(b) Claims \nUnder BIPA, Section 15(b) im poses three specific requirements on private entities \nthat “collect, capture, purchase, receive throug h trade, or otherwise ob tain a person's or \na customer's biometric identifier or biometric information.” 740 ILCS § 14/15(b) . \nSpecifically, a private entity may not collect such material unless it: \n \n7 However, as is discussed more fully herein, other extr insic materials relied on by GeoSnap are not alleged in or \nintegral to the complaint. As such, these materials will not be considered by the Court, and the Court declines to \nconvert the dismissal motion to a motion for summary judgment. Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 15 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>16 \n (1) informs the subject or the subject' s legally authorized representative in \nwriting that a biometric identifier or biometric information is being \ncollected or stored; \n \n(2) informs the subject or the subject' s legally authorized representative in \nwriting of the specific purpose and length of term for which a biometric \nidentifier or biometric information is being collected, stored, and used; \nand \n \n(3) receives a written release executed by the subject of the biometric \nidentifier or biometric information or the subject's legally authorized \nrepresentative.  \n740 ILCS § 14/15(b) .  \nCounts II -IV of the First Amended Complaint (Doc. 58) allege that GeoSnap \nviolated § 15(b) in its entirety and that ea ch violation of the three requirements is \nseparately compensable. GeoSnap, citing to Cothron v. White Castle Sys., Inc., 216 N.E.3d \n918 (Ill. 2023) , as modified on denial of reh'g (July 18, 2023), contends Plaintiffs cannot \nrecover statutory damages for its alleged violations of subsections 15(b)(1), 15(b)(2), and \n15(b)(3). Instead, GeoSnap argues, any violation of Section 15(b)’s requirements creates \none violation – not three. Accordingly, GeoSnap claims, Counts II-IV should be dismissed \nand Plaintiffs should have to plead those claims as a single cause of action.  \nIn Cothron, the Illinois Supreme Court addressed a related but distinct issue: \nwhether each unauthorized scan or transmission of  biometric data under Sections 15(b) \nand 15(d) constitutes a separate violation. Th e Court held that “a separate claim accrues \nunder the Act each time a private entity scans or transmits an individual's biometric \nidentifier or information in violation of section 15(b) or 15(d)” of the Act  Cothron, 216 \nN.E.3d at 920 . The Illinois Supreme Court also acknowledged that its decision opened the Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 16 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>17 \n door to “potentially excessive damage awards” under BIPA but concluded those policy-\nbased concerns were best addressed by the legislature. Id. at 929 .  \nCothron focused on repeated collections of bi ometric data rather than the separate \nrequirements within Section 15(b). Nonetheless, its reasoning suggests a broader \nprinciple: BIPA violations are connected to distinct acts or failures that contravene the \nstatute’s mandates. The majority emphasized  the plain language of Section 15(b), which \nprohibits collection “unless” the entity “firs t” complies with the three requirements. Id. \nat 925-26. The Court relied, in part, on its prior decision in Rosenbach v. Six Flags Entm’t \nCorp ., 129 N.E.3d 1197, 1206 (Ill. 2019) . Specifically, the Court stated: “[W]e determined \nin Rosenbach  that a person is ‘aggrieved’ or injured under the Act ‘when a private entity \nfails to comply with one of section 15's requirements.’ ” Id. at 927. The Court went to \nexplain that “ Rosenbach does not stand for the proposition that the ‘injury’ for a § 15 claim \nis predicated on, or otherwise limited to, an initial loss of control or privacy. Instead, \nRosenbach clearly recognizes the statutory violation itself is the ’injury’ for purposes of a \nclaim under the Act.” Id. at 928 . Although the Illinois court’s analysis was in the context \nof establishing an injury for standing ( Rosenbach ) and accrual of claims ( Cothron ), it \nsuggests that each requirement carries independent weig ht, supporting a finding that \nSection 15(b)’s subparts are separately compensable.8  \n \n8 In response to Cothron , the Illinois legislature amended BIPA via Senate Bill 2979. The amendment modified Section \n15(b) to state that a private entity that “in more than one instance, collects, capture s, purchases, receives through trade, \nor otherwise obtains the same biometric identifier or biometric information from the same person using the same \nmethod of collection” commits “a single violation” for which the aggrieved person is entitled to “at most, one \nrecovery.” Critically, the amendment focuses on repeated collections of the same biometric date; not on the separate \nrequirements within Section 15(b). Thus, the amendment does not alter this Court’s analysis.  \n Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 17 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>25 \n and (4) the purported BIPA compliant terms contained in the Policy are illusory. \n(Doc. 65, pgs. 19-22).  \nAlthough contracts formed by creating an account on a website are a \n“newer form[ ] of contracting,” the same common law contract principles apply: \nIn Illinois, as in many states, the law governing the formation \nof contracts on the Internet is still in the early stages of development. But \nthere is no reason to think that Illino is’s general contract principles do not \napply. Formation of a contract requires mutual assent in virtually all jurisdictions; Illinois courts use an objective approach to that question.  \nSgouros v. TransUnion Corp ., 817 F.3d 1029, 1034 (7th Cir. 2016) .  \n“Generally, a party who signs a written contract is presumed to have notice \nof all the contract’s terms.” Id. But, because many internet users fail to realize they \nare agreeing to a contract, applying this principle in the context of internet \ntransactions can be challenging. Id. In determining whether an agreement has been \nformed over the Internet, the Seventh Circuit has explained that “we might ask \nwhether the web pages presented to the consumer adequately communicate all \nthe terms and conditions of the agreem ent, and whether the circumstances support \nthe assumption that the [consumer]  receives reasonable notice of those \nterms.” Id. As the Appellate Court further explained, this analysis involves “a fact-\nintensive inquiry: we cannot presume that  a person who clicks on a box that \nappears on a computer screen has notice of all contents not only of that page but \nof other content that requires further action (scrolling, following a link, \netc.).” Id. at 1034–35 . Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 25 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>26 \n That being said, courts often find that an online contract has been formed \nwhen a customer clicks on an “I Accept” button as part of a “clickwrap” \nagreement. Domer v. Menard, Inc ., 116 F.4th 686, 694 (7th Cir. 2024)  (“Courts around \nthe country have recognized that this type of  electronic ‘click’ can suffice to signify \nthe acceptance of a contract.”) citing Sgouros , 817 F.3d at 1033 . “There is nothing \nautomatically offensive about such agreement s, as long as the layout and language \nof the site give the user reasonable notice that a click will manifest assent to an \nagreement.” Sgouros , 817 F.3d at 1033-34 .  \nGeoSnap contends the Website gave Adam Moomaw and Sarah Gustafson \nreasonable notice that by clicking the “I Agree” box, they were agreeing to the \nTerms, including the release clause found on page 11, and the Policy that GeoSnap \nalleges complies with BIPA. The problem for GeoSnap is that, on a motion to \ndismiss, the Court can only  consider extrinsic materials if they are referenced in or \ncentral to the First Amended Complaint. See Hecker v. Deere & Co.,  556 F.3d 575, \n582–83 (7th Cir. 2009) . In the instant case, this includes GeoSnap’s contract with \nTough Mudder, GeoSnap’s Terms of Service, and GeoSnap’s Privacy Policy, all of which are referenced in the Amended Co mplaint. This, however, does not include \nthe declaration provided by GeoSnap’s founder and CEO, the screenshots \npurportedly showing that Adam Moomaw and Sarah Gustafson created accounts, \nor the screenshot that purports to depict the Website’s account creation page. See \ne.g., Nicosia v. Amazon.com, Inc., 834 F.3d 220, 234 (2nd Cir. 2016)  (in deciding \nmotion to dismiss, it was error for the district court to rely on extrinsic materials Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 26 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>27 \n indicating that the plaintiff’s “purchases were made using an account created in \n2009 and that to have registered for an account in 2008 one must have checked a \nbox on the Registration Page, acknowledging acceptance of the 2008 Conditions of \nUse…[because] those facts were neither allege d in nor integral to the complaint.”). \nGeoSnap relies on these extrinsic materials to show that Adam Moomaw \nand Sarah Gustfason created accounts in 2019, and that to have created an account \nin 2019, they must have checked the “I Agree” box, which was positioned next to \nhyperlinks labeled “Terms of Service” and “Privacy Policy.” GeoSnap invites the \nCourt to consider this material and find that Adam Moomaw and Sarah Gustfason \npersonally created accounts in 2019 and personally assented to the Terms and \nPolicy. But to do so without converting the dismissal motion to a motion for \nsummary judgment would be error. \nRecognizing this issue, in a footnote, GeoSnap contends that to the extent \nthat these materials are deemed to be outside the Complaint,  the Court should \nconvert its motion to one for summary judgment. The Court declines to do so. \nFirst, GeoSnap has not provided the Court with sufficient evidentiary material to render a summary judgment decision. As previously noted, GeoSnap has not \nestablished that the account creation proce ss described in the declaration or that \nthe account creation screenshot attached to the declaration reflect the account \ncreation process in effect in 2019 or the account creation page as it existed in 2019.\n15 \n \n15 The declaration expressly states that GeoSnap is attach ing “[t]rue and accurate versions of the Terms & Conditions \nand Privacy Policy that existed in 2019.” (Doc. 62-2 ¶ 8). The declaration, however, does not provide the same \n Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 78     Filed 03/20/25     Page 27 of 29     Page ID\n#<pageID>28 \n Thus, even if considered, the extrinsic materials would not conclusively resolve \nthe factual dispute as to notice and assent.  \nSecond, at the parties’ request, merits discovery was stayed pending \nresolution of the instant motion. (Docs. 37 and 43). Because Plaintiffs have not had \nthe opportunity to fully engage in discovery to provide support for their \nallegations, it would be premature to co nvert GeoSnap’s dismissal motion to a \nmotion for summary judgment. Accordingly, the Court declines to exercise its \ndiscretion to convert GeoSnap’s dismissal motion to a motion for summary \njudgment. See Levenstein v. Salafsky , 164 F.3d 345, 347 (7th Cir. 1998)  (where \ndiscovery was ongoing, district court’s decision to treat pleading as a motion to \ndismiss, rather than converting it to a summary judgment motion, was within \ndistrict court’s discretion).  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, Defendan t GeoSnap PTY LTD’s Motion to Compel \nArbitration or, Alternatively Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint (Doc. 62) is DENIED . \nThe Court FURTHER ORDERS  that the previously imposed stay on discovery is \nlifted. By separate Order, the Court will set a new trial date and will direct the Parties to  \n  \n \nassurances as to the declarant’s description of the account creation process or the screenshot purportedly representing \nthe account creation process. Additionally, as previously noted, GeoSnap claims it has attached the Privacy Policy in \neffect in 2019, but the attached policy’s effective date is March 5, 2021. Considering these issues, whether Adam \nMoomaw and Sarah Gustafson consented to the Terms or Policy is more appropriately addressed with a fully \ndeveloped record at the summary judgment stage.

    "summary": "### 1. Summary\n\nPlaintiffs Adam and Regan Moomaw filed a class-action lawsuit against GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd and GeoSnapShot, Inc., alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to the collection of facial biometrics via GeoSnapShot's platform during a Tough Mudder event in Illinois. GeoSnapShot's platform used AI to allow users to search for photographs taken at events by uploading a \"selfie,\" thereby extracting and comparing facial geometry data from the images. In ruling on the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, the court denied GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd's motion and allowed limited jurisdictional discovery regarding GeoSnapShot, Inc.\n\n### 2. Key Legal Issue\n\nWhether the court has personal jurisdiction over GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd and its subsidiary GeoSnapShot, Inc., given their activities related to collecting biometric data from Illinois residents via an online platform.\n\n### 3. Court's Holding\n\nThe court denied GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, finding sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois due to their involvement with an online platform facilitating photography services at events, including Illinois locations. For GeoSnapShot, Inc., the court ordered limited jurisdictional discovery to further assess its connections to Illinois before a final ruling on jurisdiction could be made.\n\n### 4. ELI5 Explanation\n\nThe court case is about whether two companies, GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd (from Australia) and its U.S. arm, GeoSnapShot, Inc., can be sued in Illinois. They run an online photo service using AI technology tied to events like Tough Mudder. When users upload their selfies, AI matches them with photos taken at these events. The court decided that the Australian company could be sued in Illinois because they knew their technology was being used to serve Illinois residents. However, the court wants more information before deciding if the U.S. company can be tied to Illinois in the same way.",

BACKGROUND \nA. Overview \nGeoSnapShot created and owns and ope rates an online photo platform on a \nglobally accessible website: www.geosnapshot.com  (“Website”). (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). \nPhotographers who register with GeoSnapSho t (“Photographers”), thereby agreeing to \nits Terms of Service, can use the Website to upload (and in some instances, license to \nWebsite users) photos they take at events , and Website users can use the Website to \nsearch for, view, download (and in some case s, purchase licenses to) the photos. (Doc. 26-\n1 ¶ 5). For Photographers to be able to upload  photos, an “event organizer” (who is not a \nGeoSnapShot employee) first must create an  event on the Website. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 7).  \nGeoSnapShot’s business model is depend ent on its collection and use of the \nbiometrics of the people depicted in it s online photo platform. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 5). \nGeoSnapShot encourages event participants to find photos of themselves by uploading a \n“selfie” and allowing its artificial intelligence to compare that photo wi th the others in its \ndatabase. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 5). This can only be done by extracting from each photo data \nrepresenting the unique geometry of each fa cial image so that comparisons can be made. \n(Doc. 1-2 ¶ 5). Under BIPA, “scan[s] of  . . . face geometry” are biometrics, 740 ILCS 14/10 . \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs argue, GeoSnapShot ca nnot collect or use such scans unless it \ncomplies with BIPA.  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 2 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>3 \n In April 2019, GeoSnapShot contracted wi th Tough Mudder, an endurance event \ncompany, to allow Photographers to attend and take photographs of participants in \nTough Mudder events. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 33). On August 24, 2019, Plai ntiffs attended the “Tough \nMudder Chicago Saturday” event held in Rockford, Illinois. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 39). Thereafter, Plaintiffs used GeoSnapShot’s Website to loca te pictures of themselves participating in \nthe event. Plaintiffs “purchased” complim entary licenses to those photographs and \ndownloaded the same, receiving a receipt from GeoSnapShot.   \nB. GeoSnapShot \nGeoSnapShot is a proprietary limited comp any under the laws of Australia and is \nbased in Sydney, Australia. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 10;  Doc. 26-1 ¶¶ 2-3). Ge oSnapShot does not \nmaintain a place of business in Illinois. (D oc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnapShot does not employ \nanyone in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). GeoSnapS hot does not own, lease, or occupy any \nproperty in Illinois, and it does not own an y investments in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3). \nGeoSnapShot employs seven full-time employees , and none of those employees are based \nin Illinois. GeoSnapShot’s Website is not ho sted in Illinois and GeoSnapShot does not \nprocess photographs in Illinois. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 3; Doc. 27 p. 3).  \nC. GeoSnapShot Delaware \n GeoSnapShot Delaware is wholly owned by GeoSnapShot and is a conduit \nthrough which GeoSnapShot conducts business in the United States. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 12). \nGeoSnapShot Delaware was incorporated in  Delaware on or about January 13, 2023, and Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 3 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>4 \n has its principal place of business in Denv er, Colorado. (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 14). GeoSnapShot \nDelaware does not maintain a place of busine ss in Illinois; does no t employ anyone in \nIllinois; and does not own or lease any property in Illinois.  (Doc. 26-1 ¶ 15). GeoSnapShot \nDelaware has three employees, and those em ployees are based in Denver, Colorado. \n(Doc. 26-1 ¶ 15).  \nD. GeoSnapShot Website  \nGeosnapshot.com is a globally accessible website created and owned and operated \nby GeoSnapShot. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 4; Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). The Website includ es an online photo \nplatform that is operated by GeoSnapShot.  (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 4; Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5). GeoSnapShot \nmarkets its platform to both event organi zers and photographers. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 21).  \nFor Photographers to be able to upload ph otos to the Website, an event organizer, \nsuch as Tough Mudder, must first create an event on the GeoSnapShot website. (Doc. 26-\n1 ¶¶ 5, 7; Doc. 1-2 ¶ 22). Photographers who a ttend the event can then upload photos \nthey take at the event to the Website. (Doc . 1-2 ¶¶ 23-25; Doc. 26-1 ¶¶ 5, 7; Doc. 27-1).  \nE. GeoSnapShot Terms and Conditions \nAs a condition to using the Website, Photographers must register with the \nWebsite. (Doc. 27-1 pp. 2-4). By registering wi th the Website, Photog raphers agree to the \nWebsite’s terms and conditions. (Doc. 27-1 p. 4). Specifically, photographers agree to the \nfollowing terms:  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 4 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>5 \n 4.3 Use of the Content and Grant of License \nBy uploading Media Material to the Site the Seller has accepted these Terms \nand Conditions and agrees to the following conditions:  \n 4.3.1. The Site and the Company will use your Media Material for the \npurpose of licensing your Media Material  to customers of the Site in such \nformats as we may, from time to ti me make available to Customers, \nincluding without limiting the generali ty of the foregoing, via electronic \ndownload; \n 4.3.2.

Sellers may have alternative ph otography business/brands that \nthey use. The Site supports the sellers right for Sellers to carry on their own \nphotography businesses, however we do  not allow you to use the Site \nservices (our event calendar, our business name, our brand, our \nrelationship with other photographe rs, our relationship with event \norganizers, or any other Site services ) to compete with the Site or any \nservices that the Site provides. \n8.2. Many of the events on the Sites calendar of events are non-\nexclusive, there may be non-GeoSnapS hot photographers at the event. If \nyou book onto a GeoSnapShot event you are deemed to be representing \nGeoSnapShot at that event and you must upload photos to the \nGeoSnapShot platform for sale. You may not advertise that photos from a Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 5 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>6 \n GeoSnapShot event are for sale through any other platform or service other \nthan the Site. \n8.3. To upload photos to an even t on the GeoSnapShot calendar you \nmust be a registered photographer  for that event. The number of \nphotographers who can upload from an  event is determined by the event \norganizer. \n8.4. If the event is not on the Site s calendar you can create the event \non GeoSnapShot yourself. You can be a seller at that event and request other \nSellers (through the GeoSnapShot platform) to attend your event and \nupload photos for sale if you choose. \n8.5. The Site events calendar is for the use of Sellers and is a service \nprovided by the Site for its Sellers and Users. The calendar information is \nto be used solely by Sellers to re gister onto and attend events as a \nGeoSnapShot photographer. The Site calendar should not be used for any \nother purpose including, but not limited to; finding events to attend as a non-GeoSnapShot photographer. The Site  calendar should not be used for \nany other purpose including, but not limit ed to; finding events to attend as \na non-GeoSnapShot photographer, pa ssing calendar information to a \ndifferent company, copying, duplicat ing, linking to, redirecting to or \notherwise using the information for any other purpose.  \n8.6. If you attend a GeoSnapShot event you cannot offer an \nalternative purchasing option for ph otos other than the Site. You cannot \nadvertise your own website or other pl ace to purchase the photos from the \nGeoSnapShot event other than the Site. \n8.7. Any photographer who has breached or is deemed by \nGeoSnapShot to have breached thes e terms may have their photographer \naccount suspended or terminated immediately at the sole discretion of \nGeoSnapShot inline with the “Termination” clause. \n8.8. Some Events and Event Organizers may require you to have a \nWorking with Children Check (WWCC) or similar document determined \nby your country or state to prove th at you are certified to be working \naround minors). If you book on to an  event that requires a WWC then you \nmust ensure that you have a valid WWCC, that it is up-to-date and present \na copy to the event organizer upon arrival at the event.  \n(Doc. 27-1 pp. 10-11).

(Doc . 1-2 ¶ 4; Doc. 26-1 ¶ 5; Doc. 27-1 p. 3).3 \nIndividuals who purchase or license photos fr om the Website also agree to the Website’s \nterms and conditions. (Doc. 27-1 p. 8). The fo llowing terms and conditions are applicable \nto individuals who purchase or license  photos from the Website (“Buyers”): \n6. Buyers \nBy purchasing Media Material from th e Site you have understood, accepted \nand are bound by all these Terms and Conditions. \nFor clarity you have also read, understood and accepted all the Terms and \nConditions laid out for the Sellers. \nMedia Material viewed on the site is shown in low resolution. Upon \npurchase of Media Material you will be given a link to download the full \nresolution Media material to be sued solely for the purposes outlined in \nthese Terms and Conditions.  \nYou understand that by using the Site you may be exposed to Media \nmaterial that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. \nBy purchasing the Media Material you have accepted these Terms and \nConditions and agrees [sic] to the following: \n 6.1.1. By purchasing Media Material you are entering into an \nagreement with the Seller of the Media Material your purchase of that \nMedia Material gives you a non-transferable, non-resalable, non-exclusive \nworld-wide license to the Media Material; \n6.1.2. You may not alter the purchased Media material in any way; \n \n2 When photos are licensed through the Website, GeoS napShot receives 30% of the proceeds. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ \n25).   \n3 Initially, photos are only viewable in a lower quality or  format to that of the orig inal photo. (Doc. 27-1 p. \n3). The original content is only accessible after the bu yer successfully purchases or licenses the photos. (Doc. \n27-1 p. 3).

That agreement states that th e Seller of the Media Material \nowns the exclusive world-wide copyright and the Media Material. \n6.1.4. You do not have the rights nor may you on-license, on-sell, re-\nsell, alter, modify, share, gift or us e the Media material for marketing, \npromotional or sales purposes.

Failure to downloaded [sic] \nimmediately will be the sole responsibility of the Buyer and no liability, \ncompensation or damages may be soug ht from the Company, the Site or \nthe Buyer.  \n(Doc. 27-1 pp. 8-9).  \nF. GeoSnapShot and Tough Mudder  \nIn 2019, GeoSnapShot contracted with Toug h Mudder for Photographers to attend \nand take photographs of participants in Tough Mudder events. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 33). Tough \nMudder promotes endurance events where participants attempt 10-to-12-mile-long \nobstacle courses that feature hazards such as fields of mud and tanks of cold water. (Doc. \n1-2 ¶ 34). In an article promoting the p artnership between GeoSnapShot and Tough \nMudder, GeoSnapShot founder and chief executive Andy Edwards (“Edwards”) emphasized that GeoSnapShot’s biometric-base d Selfie Search feature was central to the Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 8 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>9 \n agreement. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 36). As Edwards stat ed in the article, because Tough Mudder \nparticipants “come out from the muddy depths , face recognition is the only thing that \nwill find photos of them.” (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 36). In the same article, Edwards touted that the \nTough Mudder partnership would help GeoS napShot realize “500% growth” in 2019. \n(Doc. 1-2 ¶ 37). Between August 2019 and December 2022, GeoSnapShot’s Website has hosted thousands of photographs from at least ten Tough Mudder events located in \nIllinois. (Doc. 1-2 ¶¶ 45, 46).  \nG. Plaintiffs  \n On August 24, 2019, Plaintiff’s attended the “Tough Mudder Chicago Saturday” \nevent in Rockford, Illinois. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 39). At  the event, photographers took photographs \nof Plaintiffs and uploaded them to GeoSnapS hot. (Doc. 1-2 ¶¶ 41-42). During the upload \nprocess, GeoSnapShot extracted facial bi ometrics from the photographs without the \nPlaintiff’s consent. (Doc. 1-2 ¶¶ 41-42). Re gan Moomaw later used the GeoSnapShot \nwebsite to “purchase” and download complim entary licenses to the photographs and \nwas issued a receipt from GeoSnapShot (D oc. 26-1 ¶ 13, Doc. 27 p. 2). The receipt \nconfirmed that each photograph was from th e “Tough Mudder Chicago Saturday” event. \n(Doc. 27-2).  \nII. LEGAL STANDARD \nUnder Rule 12(b)(2), a court may dismiss a claim for lack \nof personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) . A plaintiff need not \nallege facts about personal jurisdiction in his or her complaint, but in the face of a Rule Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 9 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>10 \n 12(b)(2)  motion, “the plaintiff bears the burd en of demonstrating the existence of \njurisdiction.” Curry v. Revolution Labs., LLC , 949 F.3d 385, 392 (7th Cir. \n2020)  (quoting Purdue Research Found. v. Sanofi-Synthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. \n2003) ). When a court rules on a Rule 12(b)(2)  motion based only on written submissions, \na plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction. GCIU-Employer \nRet. Fund v. Goldfarb Corp. , 565 F.3d 1018, 1023 (7th Cir. 2009) .

Curry , 949 F.3d at 393 . Further, where a defendant challenges \nby declaration a fact alleged in the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff must go beyond the \npleadings and submit affirmative evidence supporting the exercise of jurisdiction.

Specific jurisdiction  arises when there is:  \n(1) purposeful availment – the defendant must have purposefully directed \nhis activities at the forum state or purposefully availed himself of the \nprivilege of conducting business in the forum;  \n(2) relatedness – the alleged injury mu st arise out of or relate to the \ndefendant’s forum-related activities; and  \n(3) fairness – the exercise of person al jurisdiction must comport with \ntraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. \n \nB.D. by & through Myer v.

Purposeful Direction or Purposeful Availment  \n GeoSnapShot contends the Court cannot asse rt jurisdiction over it because it has \nno physical presence in the state and because its Website’s transactions are not stored or \nprocessed in Illinois. But “physical presence  is not necessary for a defendant to have \nsufficient minimum contacts  with a forum state,” Curry, 949 F.3d at 398 . Rather, \nestablishing minimum contacts s ufficient for the exercise of sp ecific personal jurisdiction \ndepends on whether the defe ndant has “purposefully dire cted [its] activities” or \n \n6 In evaluating personal jurisdiction, the Court addresses each Defendant separately. See Purdue Rsch. \nFound. v. Sanofi-Sunthelabo, S.A., 338 F.3d 773, 784 (7th Cir. 2003)  (“[E]ach defendant's contacts with the \nforum State must be assessed individually.”).

In other \nwords, the “inquiry boils down to this: has [GeoSnapShot] purposely exploited the \nIllinois market?”  be2 LLC v. Ivanov,  642 F.3d 555, 558 (7th Cir. 2011) .  \n GeoSnapShot contends that it has not purposely exploited the Illinois market \nbecause, among other things, it is merely a technology vendor, and any contacts it has \nwith Illinois are random, fortuitous, or atte nuated: the result of a third party’s conduct \nand/or a Website user’s unilateral conduct. It’s  true, for specific personal jurisdiction to \nexist, the contacts must come from the activity of GeoSnapShot, and not from the activity \nof a plaintiff or third party. Purdue Research Found. V. Sanofi-Synthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, \n780 (7th Cir. 2003) . See also Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 285 (2014) ; Curry , 949 F.3d at 396 . \nBut this case is distinguishable from other cases involving technology vendors where courts have found specific personal jurisdiction lacking. \nFor example, GeoSnapShot cites to Redd v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc ., 2023 WL \n3505264 (N.D. Ill. May 17, 2023)  for the proposition that GeoSnapShot, an out-of-state \ntechnology vendor, is not subject to pe rsonal jurisdiction in Illinois. In Redd , the plaintiff \nfiled a putative class action  against Amazon Web Services, Inc. (“AWS”), alleging \nviolations of BIPA. AWS provided cloud comp uting services and was registered to do \nbusiness in Illinois. AWS marketed and sold  a program called “Rekognition” (an image-\nrecognition technology) to businesses and ot her entities. A third party, Wonolo, Inc. \n(“Wonolo”) ran a mobile application that a llowed users to apply for jobs in various \nindustries. Wonolo contracted with AWS to  utilize its Rekognition technology on its \nmobile application. The plaintiff downloaded Wonolo’s application to apply for jobs at Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 14 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>15 \n several locations in Illinois. Each time sh e accepted a job through Wonolo, she scanned \nher image, thereby utilizing the Rekognition te chnology. The district court dismissed the \nplaintiff’s BIPA claims for lack of personal ju risdiction because, other than registering to \ndo business in Illinois, AWS’s only contac t with Illinois was providing its facial \nrecognition technology to Wonolo who used it in Illinois.  \nGeoSnapShot urgers this Court to find  that, like AWS, a third-party stands \nbetween GeoSnapShot and its contacts with Illinois. But unlike AWS, GeoSnapShot was \nnot merely involved in a one-off transaction with a third party who, without \nGeoSnapShot’s knowledge, utilized GeoSnapShot’s technology in Illinois for its own \npurposes. On the contrary, GeoSnapShot create d and operated a self-hosted interactive \nwebsite and allowed users, including Illinoi s users, to engage in commerce on that \nwebsite.7  \nFurther, the record reflects that, as th e owner and operator of the Website, \nGeoSnapShot stood “ready and willing” to do business with Illinois residents and then \nknowingly did business with Illinois residents. NBA Properties, Inc. v. HANWJH, 46 \nF.4th 614, 619-22 (7th Cir. 2022) . See also Illinois v. Hemi Grp. LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 758 (7th \nCir. 2010) . GeoSnapShot contends that there is no basis for concluding that it was “ready \nand willing” to do business with Illinois re sidents because (1) Tough Mudder events are \nheld throughout the United Stat es and the United Kingdom; (2 ) no advertising is directed \nat Illinois; and (3) GeoSnapShot is not involv ed in selecting the location of Tough Mudder \n \n7 The fact that GeoSnapShot’s website was available in Illinois, standing alone, does not establish specific \npersonal jurisdiction over GeoSnapShot. NBA Properties, Inc. v. HANWJH, 46  F.4th 614, 619 (7th Cir. 2022) .  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 15 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>16 \n events.8 GeoSnapShot further contends there is no basis for concluding that GeoSnapShot \nknowingly did business with Illinois resi dents because it does not know where \nphotographed individuals reside (Photographe rs do not provide residential information \nfor individuals pictured in ph otographs and event participants  do not provide residential \ninformation when they purchase and/or license photographs from the Website).  \nBut “[t]here is no per se requirement that  the defendant especia lly target the forum \nin its business activity; it is sufficient that the de fendant reasonably co uld foresee that its \nproduct would be sold in the forum. Curry v. Revolution Lab'ys, LLC , 949 F.3d 385, 399 (7th \nCir. 2020) . See also  Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781 (1984)  (with a \nnationwide market, the publisher reasonably should have anticipated that it could be \nheld accountable in the forum state for activi ties arising from the “substantial number” \nof sales in the forum state). Here, there is  ample evidence supporting a finding that \nGeoSnapShot reasonably should have foreseen that it would be licen sing (and in some \ncases selling) photographs from its online photo platform to Illinois residents.  \nFirst, GeoSnapShot entered into a co ntract with Tough Mudder to store \nphotographs taken at Tough Mudder events an d to make those photographs available to \nevent participants. The location of the even ts GeoSnapShot hosted on its Website was \nknown to GeoSnapShot. For example, GeoSnapShot’s Website hosts over 22,000 photographs from an event identified on the Website as “Tough  Mudder Chicago 2022 \nSaturday.” The address for that page is https://geosnapshot.com/e/tough-mudder-\n \n8 GeoSnapShot also contends it had no control ov er the Photographers attending Tough Mudder events. \nThe Court addresses this contention below.  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 16 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>17 \n chicago-2022-saturday/16028.  (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 46 & n.8). Second, GeoSnapShot admits that it \n“operates” an “online photo platform” (Doc. 26-1), and that Website users can license \nphotographs from that platform. This includes  thousands of photographs taken at Illinois \nevents. In the instant case, GeoSnapShot provided Plaintiffs with a license for \nphotographs taken at an Illinois event, an d after Plaintiffs licensed the photographs, \nGeoSnapShot issued a receipt identifying ea ch photograph as “Tough Mudder Chicago \nSaturday.” (Doc. 27-2).  \nThese contacts are not “random,” “fortuitou s,” or “attenuated.” They are the result \nof decisions made by GeoSnapShot, including:  the decision to enter into a contract with \nTough Mudder, an entity that GeoSnapShot kn ew held events nationally, including in \nIllinois; the decision to operate a website that hosts thousands of photographs from \nIllinois events; and the decision to license and/ or sell photographs take n at Illinois events \nto Website users. As such, even assuming  GeoSnapShot did not specifically direct \nadvertising at Illinois and did not know ea ch Website user’s address, GeoSnapShot \n“reasonably could foresee” that it would be t ransacting business with Illinois residents. \nCurry , 949 F.3d at 399–400 . See also NBA Properties, Inc. v. HANWJH, 46 F.4th 614, 625 \n(7th Cir. 2022)  (specific personal jurisdiction pres ent where website operator “structured \nits sales activity in such a manner as to in vite orders from Illinois and developed the \ncapacity to fill them.). In other words, Ge oSnapShot purposely exploited the Illinois \nmarket in a way that it should have reason ably foreseen its technology being used by, Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 17 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>20 \n being representatives of GeoSnapShot.13 Thus, GeoSnapShot’s Terms of Service support \na finding that the Photographers are acting as GeoSnapShot’s agents when they photograph events in Illinois.\n 14 See e.g., Blockmon v. McClellan , 143 N.E.3d 279, 289–92 (Ill. \nApp. Ct. 2019) (evidence showing that princi pal “had the right to control whether sales \nrepresentatives could make sales over the in ternet” and “had control over whether . . . \nsales representatives could use business card s with [the alleged principal’s] names” \nsupported finding of agency relationship); Grillo v. Yeager Constr ., 900 N.E.2d 1249, 1264 \n(Ill. App. Ct. 2008)  (An alleged principal’s identification  of a person as its “representative” \nsupports a finding that person was its agent) . Thus, the Photographers’ physical presence \nin Illinois can be attributed to GeoSnapShot, establishing purposeful availment. Walden \nv. Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 285 (2014)  (“[P]hysical entry into the State—either by the defendant \nin person or through an agent, goods, mail, or some other means—is certainly a relevant \ncontact.”). \n \n \n \npublicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate,  excerpt . . . and distribute copies of your Media \nMaterial.” (Doc. 27-1 § 4.3.2).  \n \n13 The Terms of Service state that photographers who “book onto a GeoSnapShot event . . . are deemed to \nbe representing GeoSnapShot at that event.”  \n14 GeoSnapShot’s Terms of Service state that Sellers “are not considered or  classified as employees, agents, \nrepresentatives, independent contractors, dependent co ntractors, sub-contractors, licensees, franchises or \nany other form of employee of the Site or the Compan y.” (Doc. 27-1 § 10). But, when determining whether \nan agency relationship exists, “the declaration of th e parties is not controlling where the conduct of the \nparties demonstrates the existenc e of an agency relationship.” McNerney v. Allamuradov , 84 N.E.3d 437, 454  \n(Ill. App. Ct. 2017). Additionally, as argued by Plaintiffs, GeoSnapShot’s disclaimer of any legal relationship \nwith Photographers is particularly questionable given that Photographers agree that they are “representing \nGeoSnapShot” at any event they “book onto.” (Doc. 27-1 § 8.2).  Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 20 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>21 \n 2. Arise Out of or Relate to the Forum Contacts \nThe Court next addresses whether Plaintiffs’ BIPA claims arise out of or relate to \nGeoSnapShot’s forum-related activities. A “defendant’s minimum contacts with the \nforum state [must] be suit-related.” Curry , 949 F.3d at 400  (internal quotation marks and \ncitation omitted). But a strict causal connect ion between the defendant’s in-state activity \nand the plaintiff’s suit is not required. Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 141 S. \nCt. 1017, 1026 (2021) . In the instant case, GeoSnapShot’ s forum related contacts include \nexploiting the Illinois market by operating an online photo platform for Tough Mudder \nevents, including events located in Illinois ; licensing photograph s to individuals who \nparticipated in Tough Mudder events located in  Illinois; and physical presence at Illinois \nevents attributable to GeoSnapShot by virtue of its relationship with the Photographers who upload photographs to the Website. Plaintiffs’ lawsuit is about GeoSnapShot \nimproperly extracting their biometrics from  photographs that were uploaded to its \nWebsite. GeoSnapShot was only able to extract that data because of the contacts described \nabove. As such, there is a substantial conne ction between GeoSnapShot’s forum contacts \nand the Plaintiffs’ alleged injury. See e.g., Dzananovic v. Bumple, Inc., 2023 WL 4405833, at \n* 6 (N.D. Ill. July 7, 2023)  (BIPA suit alleging defendants used their facial recognition \ntechnology to collect plaintiff’s biometri c information while he used the photo \nverification feature on online dating application substantially connected to defendants’ marketing activity and exploita tion of Illinois market); Kukovec v. Estee Lauder Cos., Inc., \n2022 WL 16744196, at *1 (N .D. Ill. Nov. 7, 2022)  (BIPA suit – which alleged that the \ndefendant’s optional makeup try-on tool on  its website collected plaintiff’s facial-Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 21 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>22 \n geometry data – related to the defendant’s sale  of cosmetics in Illinois because the virtual \ntry-on tool was part of the defendant’s sales and marketing of its cosmetics).  \n3. Fair play and substantial justice \nThe exercise of specific jurisdiction shou ld not “offend the traditional notions of \nfair play and substantial justice”. Int’l Shoe Co. v. State of Wash., Off. Of Unemployment \nComp. & Placement , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) . If sufficient contacts to the forum state are \nshown, then the defendant must make a “com pelling” case that jurisdiction would be \nunfair. Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 477 (1985) . GeoSnapShot has not \naddressed whether exercising specific jurisdic tion would be unfair, focusing instead on \nwhether minimum contacts exist, and the Co urt finds no factors that militate against \nexercising personal jurisdiction.  Indeed, where, as here, a defendant “structure[s] its [online \nconduct] so that it can easily serve [Illinoi s] consumers,” and “h[olds] itself [out] as \nconducting business nationwide,” there is no thing unduly burdensome about subjecting \nit to suit in Illinois. Curry , 949 F.3d at 402 . Further, Illinois has an interest in providing a \nforum for its residents, such as Plaintiffs an d other class members, to seek redress for the \ncollection of their biometric information in violation of BIPA, an Illinois statute.  \nC. GeoSnapShot Delaware \nDefendants contend that, because GeoSna pShot Delaware was not formed until \nJanuary 13, 2023, it did not have contact with I llinois during the period in question and \nmust therefore be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.15 Plaintiffs, however, allege \n \n15 The Tough Mudder event from which the claim arose occurred on August 24, 2019. (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 39.). Plaintiffs \nallege that ten other Tough Mudder events occurred in  Illinois between August 24, 2019 and December 4, 2022. ( Id. \n¶ 45.). Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 22 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>23 \n that GeoSnapShot Delaware “is wholly owned,  directly or indirectly, by GeoSnapShot \nPty Ltd, and is a conduit through which GeoSnapShot Pty Ltd conducts business in the United States.” (Doc. 1-2 ¶ 12). Because Defendants do not refute GeoSnapShot Delaware’s alleged role in assisting GeoSnapShot in conducting business in the United States, Plaintiffs contend they are en titled to jurisdictional discovery.  \n District courts have discretion to author ize limited discovery into jurisdictional \nissues. See In re Sheehan , 48 F.4th 513, 526 (7th Cir. 2022). Howev er, “[a] plaintiff must be \nable to establish a colorable or prima faci e showing of personal jurisdiction before \ndiscovery should be permitted.” Id. Meeting this standard is  not particularly onerous; \ncourts typically allow jurisdictional discove ry if the plaintiff can show an ambiguity \nexists or that some jurisdictional facts are unclear. JT's Frames, Inc. v. Casares , 2018 WL \n835225, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 13, 2018) .  \nThe Court finds that the alleged corporat e relationship between the Defendants, \nwarrants further exploration. Without juri sdictional discovery, Plaintiffs cannot \nreasonably be expected to offer contrary evid ence of Defendants’ corporate structure or \noperations in the United States during the relevant time. Accordingly, the Motion to \nDismiss Defendant GeoSnapShot Delaware will be DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE \npending limited jurisdictional discovery, at  the conclusion of which, GeoSnapShot \nDelaware may re-file its motion.  \nIV. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, Defend ant GeoSnapShot PTY LTD’s Motion to \nDismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction (Doc. 26) is DENIED . As to Defendant Case 3:23-cv-01321-DWD     Document 38     Filed 03/07/24     Page 23 of 24     Page ID\n#<pageID>24 \n GeoSnapShot Inc., the Court finds that limit ed jurisdictional discovery is warranted. \nAccordingly, the Motion for Leave to Dismi ss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction as to \nDefendant GeoSnapShot Inc. is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE  to being re-filed after \nthe completion of such discovery. With re gard to Defendant GeoSnapShot Inc. and \njurisdictional discovery, the Court sets the following schedule:  \n1) Jurisdictional discovery as to Defendant GeoSnapShot Inc. shall be completed by \nJune 5, 2024.  \n \n2) GeoSnapShot Inc.’s renewed motion to dismi ss for lack of personal jurisdiction, if \nany, shall be filed by June 12, 2024.   \nSO ORDERED.  \nDated: March 7, 2024 \n       s /\nDavid W.

    "summary": "1. Summary: In the case of Charmaine Tate v. VITAS Healthcare Corporation, the court addressed whether the use of conversation intelligence software by VITAS and its provider, Invoca, violated California's privacy laws. The court found that Invoca could be considered a third party since it has the capability to use data collected from VITAS's calls for its own purposes, thereby potentially infringing the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The use of AI and automated systems is central to this case, as Invoca's software records, analyzes, and stores call data without the consent of the callers, which is essential to the plaintiff's claims.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the use of Invoca’s AI-powered conversation intelligence software by VITAS and Invoca itself constitutes a violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act by recording and analyzing phone calls without the consent of all parties, treating Invoca as a third party.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court denied VITAS Healthcare Corporation's motion to dismiss, holding that Invoca is deemed a third party capable of using the data for its purposes, which may trigger liability under section 631(a) of the California Invasion of Privacy Act. Consequently, both Invoca and VITAS might be liable for aiding in the alleged privacy violations.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you call a company to discuss something personal, and without telling you, they use a computer program to listen and keep a record of what you say. In this case, the company and the group that made the computer program both didn't tell the caller about this listening and recording. The court said that this wasn't okay and that the way they use this program might break the law since they can use what you say in ways you didn’t agree to. The court decided the caller has a fair point, so they are letting the lawsuit continue.",

Unknown to the woman \ncalling , the healthcare provider utilized  a software to listen to the contents of the call \nand produce  data about the call’s purpose and resolution.  Via its Terms of Service, \nthe software creator reserved the rights to employ the data yielded from those calls \nfor its own business and product development functions .  Does the woman have a \nviable  claim that the use of that software by the healthcare provider and the software \ndeveloper  violated California privacy laws?   \nIn weighing this question , the Court must determine whether the software \ndeveloper is a third party separate from the healthcare provider, or an extension of \nthe healthcare provider itself.   The Court joins a number of district courts in holding Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 1 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  2  \n \n that the developer  of software used to record and analyze phone calls is a third party \nwhen the developer is able to utilize  data obtained for its own purposes , separate \nfrom the interests of the parties to the call .  The Court finds that the software \ndeveloper in this case is capable of using  the data for its own purposes , and because \nthe use of its software was not disclosed to the caller, it may be in violation of  \nCalifornia privacy laws.   Additionally, because  the healthcare provider aided the \nsoftware developer in obtaining access to the client calls, it may also be held liable.   \nAccordingly, Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 12 ) is DENIED.  \nBACKGROUND  \nDefendant VITAS Healthcare Corporation operates hospice and palliative care \nlocations throughout California.  ( ECF No. 10; “ FAC ” ¶ 9.)  It utilizes  a conversation \nintelligence software -as-a-service (“SaaS”) provided by Invoca, Inc. (“Invoca”)  to help \nanalyze the more than 90,000 annual calls it receives to its call centers .  (Id. ¶¶ 1, 36.)  \nWhen a person calls VITAS, Invoca’s software records and creates a transcript of the \ncaller’s speech.  ( Id. ¶ 20.)  Invoca feeds that transcript to an artificial intelligence (AI) \nprogram that identifies patterns and classifies the data  into a searchable database , \nwhich is then sent to VITAS.  ( Id.)  This data base  is used by VITAS to understand what \nquestions and concerns its callers have, so that VITAS  can adjust the content it delivers \nto consumers and the call scripts utilized  by its representatives.  ( Id. ¶ 37.)  Under  its \nTerms of Service, Invoca can also use data obtained for other limited purposes, \nincluding “to optimize and improve Services or otherwise operate Invoca’s business.”  \n(Id. ¶¶ 33, 34.)  Neither VITAS nor Invoca obtain the consent of any caller to VITAS’ s \ncall center , and callers are unaware that their speech is being recorded and analyzed .  \n(Id. ¶¶ 6, 40.) \nIn late 2023, Plaintiff Charmaine Tate called Defendant VITAS and spoke with a \nVITAS representative regarding  hospice care for Tate’s grandmother.  ( Id. ¶¶ 8, 42.)  \nTate alleges that the use of Invoca’s software  to record and analyze her and other s’ \ncalls  to VITAS  violates the California Invasion of Privacy Act ( “CIPA ”) sections  631(a) Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 2 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  3  \n \n (unauthorized wiretapping)  and 632(a)  (unauthorized eavesdropping on or recording \nof confidential communications ), and that VITAS is liable for aiding those  violation s.  \n(Id. ¶ 41 ; see Cal. Pen. Code1 §§ 631(a), 632(a). )  On February 28, 2024, Tate brought \nthis action  in the Sacramento Superior Court  on behalf of herself and members of a \nproposed class , and it was removed to federal court on May 9, 2024 .  The proposed \nclass for which Tate seeks certification would consist of all California residents who \ncalled VITAS’s customer service line while in California and whose conversations with \nVITAS were intercepted and recorded by Invo ca.  (Id. ¶ 49.)   \nLEGAL STANDARD  \nA party may move to dismiss for “failure to state a claim upon which relief can \nbe granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  The motion may be granted only if the complaint \nlacks a “cognizable legal theory or sufficient facts to support a cognizable legal \ntheo ry.”  Mendiondo v. Centinela Hosp. Med. Ctr. , 521 F.3d 1097, 1104 (9th Cir. 2008).  \nWhile the Court assumes all factual allegations are true and construes “them in the \nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party,” Parks Sch. of Bus., Inc. v. Symington , 51 \nF.3d 1480, 1484 (9th Cir. 1995) , if the complaint's allegations do not “plausibly give \nrise to an entitlement to relief” the motion must be granted, Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. \n662, 679 (2009)  (“Iqbal ”). \nA complaint need contain only a “short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing that the pleader is entitled to relief,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), not “detailed \nfactual allegations,” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).  However,  \nthis rule demands more than unadorned accusations; “sufficient factual matter” must \nmake the claim at least plausible.  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678.  In the same vein, conclusory \nor formulaic recitations of elements do not alone suffice.  Id.  “A claim has facial \nplausib ility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Id.  This \n \n1 All undesignated statutory references are to the California Penal Code  unless otherwise specified .

Section 631(a) \noutlines  repercussions for any person:  \n  \n(1) “[W] ho, by means of any machine, instrument, or contrivance, or in any other \nmanner, intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection, whether \nphysically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any \ntelegraph or telephone wire, line , cable, or instrument, including the wire, \nline, cable, or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, \nor who willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, \nor in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to r ead, or to learn the \ncontents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the \nsame is in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or is being sent \nfrom, or received at any place within this state ;” or \n(2) “[W]ho  uses, or attempts to use, in any manner, or for any purpose, or to \ncommunicate in any way, any information so obtained, or who aids, agrees \nwith, employs, or conspires with any person or persons to unlawfully do, or \npermit, or cause to be done any of the acts or things mentioned above in \nthis section .” \n \n \n \nSection 632(a) prohibits a person from:  \n  \n“[I]ntentionally and without the consent of all parties to a confidential \ncommunication, us [ing]  an electronic amplifying or recording device to \neavesdrop upon or record the confidential communication, whether the \ncommunication is carried on among the parties in the presence of one another \nor by means of a telegraph, telephone, or other device, excep t a radio .” \n \nThere are three questions the Court must consider in weighing VITAS’s Motion \nto Dismiss  (hereinafter, “Mot.”).  First, the Court must determine the standard to apply \nto Invoca’s access to VITAS’s caller data , specifically whether Tate must allege that \nInvoca actually  used  the data for its own purposes, or merely that Invoca was capable  \nof doing  so.  Second, the Court must decide whether Invoca’s software is considered a \n“device” under section 632 (a).  Finally, the Court must assess whether a common law Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 4 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  5  \n \n aiding and abetting standard should be read into section 63 1(a).  At present, t here  is \nno Ninth Circuit precedent  on these questions and d istrict courts in this Circuit have \nreached different results .  The Court discusses each issue in turn.  \nI. Whether Invoca must actually use the data it obtains for its own purposes  \nSection 631(a) prohibits third part ies from “read[ing], or attempt[ing] to read, or \nto learn the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication” “without \nthe consent of all parties to the communication.”  § 631(a).   Plaintiff alleges that \nInvoca, via its software, learns  the contents of calls to VITAS without the consent of the \ncaller, therefore violating section 631(a)  as an unauthorized, third -party listener .  (FAC \n¶ 7.)  Defendant counters that because Invoca  provides its data solely to VIT AS, it is \nnot a third party but rather an extension of VITAS itself , and therefore the use of \nInvoca’s software cannot violate section 631(a) .  (Mot.  at 3–6.) \nThere are two seminal California cases that frame how courts consider third \nparties under CIPA : Rogers v. Ulrich , 52 Cal.  App. 3d 894 (1975)  and Ribas v. Clark , 38 \nCal. 3d 355 ( 1985 ).  In Rogers , Ulrich used a tape recorde r attached to his telephone \nto record his phone call with Rogers, and then later played that recording for a third \nparty who was not involved in the call.  Id. at 897 –98.  The California Court of Appeal \nheld that Ulrich’s use of a tape -recording device did not violate section  631(a)’s \nrestriction  on eavesdropping because Ulrich himself was a party to the call , noting that \n“only a third party can listen secretly to a private conversation .”  Id. at 899 ; see Ribas , \n38 Cal.  3d at 360, fn.3 (“Rogers  merely held, correctly, that section 631 does not \npenalize the secret recording of a conversation by one of the participants .”).  In other \nwords, Ulrich’s recording device was seen as a permissible extension of Ulrich himself.  \nBy contrast, in  Ribas , a woman called her husband and had Clark, a third party , \nlisten in live on her phone call as the husband  allegedly  confessed that he had \nprevented his wife from obtaining counsel during the dissolution proceedings of their \nmarriage.  38 Cal. 3d at  358–59.  The California Supreme Court held that Clark’s secret \nmonitoring was prohibited under section 631 (a), noting that this kind of privacy Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 5 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  6  \n \n violation  committed by a third party to the call “denies the speaker an important \naspect of privacy of communication ,” and that the state legislature had sought to curb \nthese sorts of privacy  violation s.  Id. at 361.  \nThe Court is tasked with determining whether Invoca’s software is more similar \nto the permissible tape recorder used in Rogers , or the impermissible third -party  \nlistener in Ribas .  That is  to say , does the software function as a recording made by a \nparty to the call, or is it a separate party entirely ?  Further, t here is a split amongst  \ndistrict courts as to whether a third -party  entity must actually use the data it obtains for \nits own purposes or if it merely needs to have the capability to do so to act as  a third \nparty in violation of  section 63 1(a).   \nOn one side of this split is Graham v. Noom, Inc. , 533 F.  Supp.  3d 8 23 (N.D. Cal. \n2021 ).  See also Yockey v. Salesforce, Inc. , 688 F.  Supp.  3d 962 (N.D . Cal. 2023).  \nGraham  involved a web application called  Noom, which utilized  a software designed \nby FullStory to record what actions visitors took on Noom’s website, including visitors’ \nkeystrokes, mouse clicks, and page scrolling.  Id. at 827.  A visitor to Noom’s website \nsued, alleging that the software’s collection of user interactions with the application \nconstituted privacy violations under section 631(a).  Id. at 828 –29.  The Graham court \nheld that neither company violated section 631(a), reasoning that FullStory merely \ncaptured the user data and hosted that data on its own servers where Noom could \nthen use the data by analyzing it.  Id. at 832 –33.  The court distinguished the case from \nsimilar ones in which the software developer had actually received some sort of \nbenefit from collecting user data itself, such as when those software developers \nthemselves separately sold the user data.  Id.; see Revitch v. New Moosejaw, LLC , 2019 \nWL 5485330  (N.D. Cal. Oct. 23, 2019) .  Noting these differences , the court saw \nFullStory’s software as an  extension of Noom itself because Noom was the party that \nwas responsible for assessing the data received, with the softw are solely working to \ncollect that data for Noom , and Noom alone .  Graham , 533 F.  Supp.  3d at 832–33.   Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 6 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  7  \n \n On the other side of this split is Javier v. Assurance IQ, LLC , 649 F.  Supp.  3d 891 \n(N.D. Cal. 2023 ).  Javier involved Assurance IQ, LLC’s use of a software developed by \nActiveProspect Inc., which tracked website visitors’ keystrokes, mouse clicks, data \nentry, and other interactions.  Id. at 894.  In weighing the plaintiff’s  section 631(a) \nclaim , the Javier court critiqued Graham ’s reasoning that a third -party software \ndeveloped would need to use the data for its own purposes in order for it to violate \nsection 631(a).  Id. at 900.   The Javier court noted that there is already a use \nrequirement in one of section 631 (a)’s discrete clauses  (“us[ing], or attempt[ing] to \nuse, in any manner, or for any purpose, or to communicate in any way, any information \nso obtained ”), and therefore it would be improper to impute that use requirement to \nall of section 631(a).  Id.  The court in that case also noted that in Ribas , the California \nSupreme Court never considered the wife’s friend’s intentions or her use for the \ninformation obtained , and so to consider a third party’s intent in obtaining data here \nwould similarly  be improper .  Id.; Ribas , 38 Cal.  3d at 360 –61.   \nThe Court finds Javier ’s reasoning to be more  persuasive.  Section 631(a)’s text, \nwhich prohibits a third party from “learn[ing] the contents or meaning of any \nmessage,” does not actually contain a use requirement.  See id. at 899 –900; §  631(a).  \nBut in a separate  section, separated by a semicolon, the statute then prohibits a party \nfrom “us[ing], or attempt[ing] to use” any obtained information.  §  631(a).  The statute \noutlines severa l ways for its restriction to apply and  does not limit its application solely \nto parties that directly use the data they obtain from listening in on a call.   In other \nwords, an  entity can violate the statute by learning  the contents of the message or by \nusing information obtained from listening in on a conversation .  Similar to the \nCalifornia Supreme Court and Javier court, this Court finds it unnecessary  to consider \na third party’s intention to collect  or use  data from a call.  See Ribas , 38 Cal. 3d at 360 –\n61.  Obtaining  that data  while reserving the capability to utilize  it makes a third party \ndistinct from one of the parties to the call and may  trigger a violation of section 631(a).  Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 7 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  8  \n \n This reading of the statute’s plain text is also in line with what  the California \nSupreme Court has made clear : that the state legislature’s “express objective in \nenacting section 631” was to  protect callers from having an outsider “tap [their] \ntelephone or listen  in on the call.”  Ribas , 38 Cal.  3d at 363.   Because Invoca’s software \neffectively “ listen [s] in” on user calls, independently analyzes that data, and  the \ncompany  reserves the capability to then use that data for its o wn purposes, Invoca’s \nsoftwar e may be in violation of  631(a).  \nMoreover, while the Court does not find Graham persuasive, even Graham itself \ndoes not help Defendant here.  While Graham  likewise involved claims of improper \ncollection of data rather than use of that data, critically in Graham  the plaintiffs did not \nallege that FullStory collected the data and could use it for its own purposes.  Rather, \nthey attacked FullStory’s storage of user information on its servers, framing that \nstorage itself as a violation of section 631(a).  Id. at 828, 832 –33.  The district court \nrejected the plaintiff’s argument, noting that “ there are no allegations here that \nFullStory intercepted and used the d ata itself,” and highlighted that FullStory’s \nsoftware simply recorded data that was then analyzed by Noom, rather than FullStory.  \nId. at 832 –33.  But here, Plaintiff does allege that Invoca has the capability to analyze \nthe data itself and further, that Invoca expressly reserves the ability to use that data for \nits own purposes.  (FAC ¶¶ 30 –35.)   \nDefendant’s reliance on Yockey v. Salesforce, Inc., 688 F. Supp. 3d 962  (N.D. \nCal. 2023) to argue that an alleged third party that merely records data for a \nlegitimate party to a call does not violate section 631(a) is similarly unavailing.  ( See \nMot. at 4 –5.)  Yockey involved Rite Aid and Kaiser Permanente’s utilization  of a \nsoftware developed by Salesforce to create transcripts of online chat messages sent \non the companies’ website.  Yockey , 688 F. Supp. 3d at 967 –68.  Interestingly, and to \nDefendant’s de triment, that case specifically recognized that the inquiry into whether \na third -party acts as an extension of a part to the call hinges on “whether the third \nparty ‘ha[s] the capability to use its record of the interaction for any other purpose.’”  Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 8 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  9  \n \n See id . at 972, quoting Javier , 649 F. Supp. 3d at 900 .  The plaintiffs in that case did \nnot sufficiently allege that the third party could use any data obtained for its own \npurpose —they were not able to point  to evidence beyond the third party’s possession \nof user data to substantiate their claim .  Id. at 972 –73.  But here, as discussed next , \nPlaintiff does properly allege that Invoca has that capability, namely  Invoca’s express \nreservation of that ability in its Terms of Service .  VITAS’ own case citations support the \nargument that Invoca’s ability to use the data  it collects for its own purposes is itself \nsufficient to establish a violation of section 631(a).  \nVITAS maintains that Invoca’s collection of data is solely for the use of VITAS \nand that Invoca cannot use the data for any other purpose s.  (Mot. at 4–6.)  VITAS \npoints to a “Business Association Agreement,” which it states precludes Invoca from \nutilizing  any data obtained for its own purposes.  (Id. at 6, fn.3. )  VITAS does not attach \na copy of this Agreement as an exhibit nor does it explicitly describe its contents ; and \nin any event the Court is precluded from relying on such factual assertions in resol ving \na motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) .  See Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. \nAgency , 261 F.3d 912, 925 (9th Cir. 2001) (“[E]vidence outside the complaint . . . \nshould not be considered in ruling on a motion to dismiss.”) .  Regardless  of any \nBusiness Association Agreement , Invoca’s  Terms of Service expressly reserve the \nability to use “Client  Data, as reasonably necessary for Invoca to provide and enhance \nits provision of services.”  (FAC ¶ 33. )  Under the se Terms of Service, Invoca may use \nthe data obtained from calls placed to VITAS to improve its own product and services.  \nInvoca’s software has already allegedly violated the caller’s privacy; whether Invoca  \nactually uses the contents of the call for its own purposes  is not legally relevant.  See \nJavier , 649 F.  Supp.  3d at 900.    \nAccordingly, the Court finds that Invoca , via its  software , is a third party, distinct \nfrom both Plaintiff Tate and Defendant VITAS , and that Invoca’s ability to use the data \nobtained for its own purposes may be sufficient to trigger section 631(a) liability.  \n//// Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 9 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  10  \n \n II. Whether Invoca’s software is an “electronic amplyfying or recording \ndevice”  \nFinding that Invoca  is a third party, the Court must then determine whether it is \na recording device under section 632(a).  As relevant here, section 632 (a) prohibits \nthird parties from using  a “recording device to eavesdrop upon or record the \nconfidential communication” of a call , but does not provide a definition of “device.”   \n§ 632(a).  Defendant VITAS asserts that Invoca’s software is not a “device” under CIPA .  \n(Mot. at 7–8.)  District courts have defined “device” differently depending on which \nsection of CIPA a claim arises under.  For example, in In re Google Location History \nLitigation , 428 F.  Supp.  3d 185 , 193 (N.D. Cal. 2019)  (“Google Litigation ”), the court \nanalyzed a software under a different section of CIPA —section 637.7 (d)—and found  that \n“[s]oftware like Google Maps, Chrome, etc. are not ‘devices’ within the meaning of \nCIPA because they are not ‘equipment.’“   But courts have also reached contrary \nresults.  In  Gladstone v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc. , 2024 WL 3276490, *8 (W.D. Wash. \nJuly 2, 2024) , the court turned to the federal Wiretap Act for a definition of “device” \nunder CIPA and found “ that ‘device,’ as used in section 632, can incl ude software.”  \nAfter weighing these two approaches, the Court agrees with Gladstone that section \n632(a)’s  definition of “device” can include  Invoca’s software.  \nFederal courts apply state  rules of statutory construction when interpreting a \nstatute  from that state .  See In re Lares , 188 F.3d  1166,  1168  (9th Cir. 1999) .  The first \nstep in that inquiry is to “scrutinize the actual words of the statute, giving them a plain \nand commonsense meaning.”   Cal. Tchrs.  Assn.  v. Governing  Bd. of Rialto  Unified  Sch.  \nDist. , 14 Cal. 4th 627,  633 (internal  quotations  omitted ).  If no ambiguity exists, the \nplain language of the statute governs.  People  v. Snook , 16 Cal. 4th 1210,  1215  (1997)   \n(“Snook ”). \nDefendant VITAS urges the Court to look to  Google Litigation , 428 F.  Supp.  3d \n185, and Moreno v. S.F. Bay Area Rapid Transit Dist. , 2017 WL 6387764 (N.D. Cal. Dec. \n14, 2017) , both of which conclude that  a software is not a device under CIPA.  (Mot. at Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 10 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  11  \n \n 8.)  However,  neither case is  applicable  because they both analyze “devices” under \nsection 637.7 (d), rather than section 632(a).  Google Litigation  involved  a tracking \nsoftware that collected and stored user data.  428 F.  Supp.  3d at 18 7–88.  A user sued \nunder section 637.7, alleging that the software improperly tracked and stored their \nlocation, but the district court dismissed the claim , finding that downloaded software \nis not a device  within the meaning of  section 637(d) .  Id. at 19 3–94.  And in Moreno , \nwhen faced with a similar set of facts, the court  reached the same conclusion, positing  \nthat software is not a “device” under section 637(d) .  2017 WL 6387764  at *5.   \nBut section 637.7(d)’s text explicitly restricts its definition of “electronic tracking  \ndevice” (emphasis added) to that specific section, rather than to other sections such as \n632(a)  which use the more gen eric phrase “electronic device ”.  See § 637.7(d ) (“As \nused in this section, ‘electronic tracking  device’ means . . .”).   And even if its definition \nwere used to inform other sections,  section 637.7  is concerned with electronic \ntracking dev ices that are clearly meant to be physical  and thus is not a proper \nconsideration for defining “device” under section 632(a) .  Specifically , section  637.7 (d) \ndefines an “electronic tracking device ” as one  that can be “attached to a vehicle or \nother movable thing”  which evinces  the statute’s emphasis on proscribing physical \ntracking devices .  See § 637.7(d ).  Section 632(a), however, lacks any language \nsuggesting that a n “electronic amplifying or recording device” must be physical  in \nnature .  Relying on the more specific text of section 637.7(d) to inform section 632(a) is \nmisguided, given section 637.7(d)’s explicit focus on  tangible  devices.   \nGladston e, which considers the definition of “device” under the federal Wiretap \nAct, provides a more helpful framework for deducing what “device” means under  \nsection 632(a ).  2024 WL 3276490.  Courts routinely look to federal law in interpreting \nCIPA, which was modeled off the Wiretap Act.   See Brodsky v. Apple Inc ., 445 F.  Supp.  \n3d 110,  127 (N.D. Cal. 2020)  (“The analysis for a violation of CIPA is the same as that \nunder the federal Wiretap Act.” ), quoting Cline v. Reetz -Laiolo , 329 F.  Supp.  3d 1000, \n1051 (N.D. Cal. 2018); see also  18 U.S.C. § 251 0 et seq .  In Gladstone , the district Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 11 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  12  \n \n court turned to the Wiretap Act to help determine whether a software developed by \nAmazon that recorded and analyzed call information should be considered a device \nunder section 632(a ).  The Gladstone court considered two factors —first, that the \nmajority of federal courts nationwide applying the federal Wiretap  Act have landed on \na definition of “device” that includes software.  See United States v. Hutchins , 361 F.  \nSupp.  3d 779, 795 (E.D. Wis. 2019) (collecting cases) ; see also In re Carrier IQ, Inc. , 78 \nF. Supp.  3d 1051, 1087 (“ Software is an ‘[e]lectronic, mechanical, or other device’ \nwhich ‘can be used to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication.’” ).  Second, \nthe court considered the California Supreme Court’s instruction that “ all CIPA \nprovisions are to be interpreted in light of the broad privacy -protecting statutory \npurposes of CIPA.”  Gladstone , 2024 WL 3276490  at * 8, quoting  Javier v. Assurance \nIQ, LLC,  2022 WL 1744107, *2 (9th Cir. May 31, 2022) ; see Ribas , 38 Cal.  3d 355.    \nThese factors together support a reading that software can be a device under \nsection 632(a).   Invoca’s software, while not a physical device, has the  capability to \nrecord  confidential information made in calls  and reproduce those calls and data \nextracted from them for VITAS  or Invoca .  That is to say, even though it is not physical , \nthe software functionally operates in a way that is reasonably envisioned by the \nstatute.   And like in Gladstone , the recording undertaken by the software infringes on \nthe very privacy right that the California Legislature sought to enshrine in CIPA.  See \nRibas,  38 Cal. 3d at 359 (“ In enacting this statute, the Legislature declared in broad \nterms its intent ‘to protect the right of privacy of the people of this state ’ from what it \nperceived as ‘a serious threat to the free exercise of personal liberties [th at] cannot be \ntolerated in a free and civilized society. ’  [Citation.]  This philosophy appears to lie at \nthe heart of virtually all the decisions construing the Privacy Act. ”) \nBecause the software can record conversations and in doing so, violates the \nprivacy of at least one of the callers,  the Court finds that Invoca’s software can be \nconsidered a “device” under section 632(a).   Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 12 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  13  \n \n III. Whether VITAS can be held liable for aiding, agreeing with, employing, or \nconspiring with Invoca  \n Under 631(a), an entity that “uses, or attempt s to use, in any manner, or for any \npurpose, or to communicate in any way, any information so obtained, or who aids, \nagrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons  to unlawfully do, or \npermit, or cause to be done any of the acts or things mentioned above in this section ” \nmay be held liable.   § 631(a) (italics added ).  Defendant VITAS argues  that it lacks the \nrequisite intent under an “aiding and abetting” standard because it did not know that \nInvoca wa s allegedly violating section 631(a) .  (Mot. at 7.) \nThe plain text of section 631(a) is unambiguous on this issue:  the statute \nrequires that a party “aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires” with another party.  \n§ 631(a).   It does not require that a party aid and abet.  See Cousin v. Sharp \nHealthcare , 681 F. Supp. 3d 1117, 1130 (S.D. Cal. 2023) (“ Defendant's contention that \n‘aids’ means ‘aiding and abetting ’ ignores the ‘agrees with, employs, or conspires with ’ \nlanguage of the clause .”).  VITAS’s proposed  “aiding  and abetting” standard goes \nbeyond what the statute requires , and there is no basis to read in a common law \nstandard  of aiding and abetting  when the statute itself is clear .  See Snook , 16 Cal. 4th \nat 1215  (“If there  is no ambiguity  in the language,  we presume  the Legislature  meant  \nwhat  it said and the plain  meaning  of the statute  governs. ”).  Instead, to establish a \nviolation a plaintiff need only prove that a party (VITAS) aided, agreed with, employed, \nor conspired with  a third party (Invoca) as it violat ed section 631(a).  As discussed \nabove, Plaintiff Tate has pled facts that would support a viable claim that Invoca has \nviolated the statute .  Plaintiff’s claims that  VITAS has supported Invoca in doing so  by \nallowing  Invoca access to the calls and has presumably paid Invoca to analyze the data \nthose calls yield  are sufficient to implicate section 631(a ).  Accordingly, the Court finds \nthat VITAS may  be found liable under section 631(a)  for its role in assisting Invoca ’s \nmonitor ing and analy sis of  calls made to VITAS .  \n//// Case 2:24-cv-01327-DJC-CSK   Document 27   Filed 01/08/25   Page 13 of 141 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  14  \n \n \nCONCLUSION  \nIn accordance with the above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendant’s Motion \nto Dismiss (ECF No. 12) is DENIED.   \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \n \nDated:      January 8, 2025      \nHon.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied Bumble, Inc.'s motion to dismiss a class action lawsuit, which accused it of violating Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The plaintiff, Dario Dzananovic, claimed that Bumble's dating app used facial recognition technology to collect biometric data without user consent through its photo verification feature. The court found that Bumble's significant marketing activities and revenue generation in Illinois established personal jurisdiction, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois has personal jurisdiction over Bumble, Inc. and related entities for alleged violations of Illinois's Biometric Information Privacy Act.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it has specific personal jurisdiction over Bumble and its associated entities because they purposefully targeted and exploited the Illinois market through extensive marketing and the operation of their dating app, thereby allegedly violating the Biometric Information Privacy Act in the state of Illinois.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Bumble is like a big store online that people in Illinois visit a lot. The store is accused of secretly taking photos of people’s faces to store them, without asking if it’s okay. Somebody from Illinois said that's not right and wants the store to be accountable. The court decided it can indeed handle this case because the store does a lot of business in Illinois and what it’s accused of doing happened because people in Illinois used its services.",

Wood   BUMBLE, INC., et al.,     )   \n ) \nDefendants. ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER \nPlaintiff Dario Dzananovic, an Illinois resi dent, has brought this putative class action \nagainst Defendants Bumble, Inc., Buzz Holdings L.P. (“Buzz Holdings” or “Bumble Holdings”), \nand Bumble Trading LLC (“Bumble Trading”) (co llectively, “Defendants”), claiming that they \nviolated Illinois’s Biometric Informa tion Privacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 ILCS 14/1 et seq.  \nSpecifically, Dzananovic alleges th at Defendants used their faci al recognition technology to \ncollect his biometric in formation while he used the photo verification feature on the Bumble \nonline dating application (“Bumb le App” or “App”). Now befo re the Court is Defendants’ \nmotion to dismiss the complaint fo r lack of personal jurisdicti on pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(2). (Dkt . No. 29.) For the following reasons, Defendants’ motion is \ndenied. \nBACKGROUND \nWhen considering a motion to dismiss for l ack of personal jurisdiction, any well-pleaded \nfacts alleged in the complaint are taken as true an d any factual disputes in affidavits are resolved \nin the plaintiff’s favor. Tamburo v. Dworkin , 601 F.3d 693, 700 (7th Cir. 2010). The facts recited \nhere are taken from Dzananovic’s Amended Comp laint (“Complaint”). The Court will address Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 1 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n2 \n the affidavits and other evidence the parties a ttached to their briefs, as appropriate, when \ndiscussing the parties’ arguments below. See Purdue Rsch. Found. v. Sanofi-Sunthelabo, S.A. , \n338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. 2003). \nAs alleged, the Bumble App is a popular  dating platform—with approximately 100 \nmillion registered users globall y—on which women initiate cont act with prospective dating \npartners. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 3–5, Dkt. No. 21.) The App functions usi ng “a freemium model,” \nwhere certain services are free, but users must pa y for subscriptions or in-app purchases to access \npremium features. ( Id. ¶ 16.) In the third quarter of 2021, for example, the Bumble App \ngenerated $142.5 million in reve nue from premium services. ( Id.) Bumble, Inc. is an American \nsocial media company that form erly operated the Bumble App; it is now a holding company with \na controlling equity interest in Buzz Holdings. ( Id. ¶¶ 10–11.) Bumble, In c. manages Buzz \nHoldings’s business and affairs and c ontrols Bumble Trad ing’s operations. ( Id. ¶¶ 12, 19.) While \nBumble Holdings operates the Bumble App, Bumble  Trading runs the marketing and advertising \nof the Bumble App in the United States and controls personal information collected and \nprocessed through the App. ( Id. ¶¶ 19, 22, 24.) Bumble, Inc.’s ma in source of revenue from the \nApp consists of users’ subscr iptions and in-app purchases. ( Id. ¶ 12.) For instance, in the third \nquarter of 2021, the Bumble App had 1.5 million paying users, leading to $30.99 in average revenue per paying user. ( Id. ¶ 34.) Defendants generate revenue  from thousands of paying users \nin Illinois. ( Id.) \nDzananovic is an Illinois re sident who has used the Bu mble App since March 2021. ( Id. \n¶ 9.) To use the Bumble App, users must prov ide personal identifying information (“PII”), \nincluding date of birth, location, gender identity, and sexual pref erence; Bumble then collects, \nretains, and uses the data for targeted marketing practices. ( Id. ¶¶ 71–72.) Additionally, Bumble Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n3 \n has machine learning capabilities , allowing it to analyze users’  behavioral information to \npersonalize potential matches show n to users and to target user s who are more apt to become \npaid members. ( Id. ¶¶ 83–84.) Further, the App has an optio nal photo verification feature to help \nprotect users from fake accounts. ( Id. ¶¶ 74–75.) Defendants promot e the photo verification \nfeature as a way for users to “flirt, connect, and network comf ortably, knowing the person you’re \ntalking to is exactly w ho they say they are.” ( Id. ¶ 36.) To verify an account, a user uploads a \nphotograph mimicking a pose that the App provides, and the A pp subsequently reviews the \nphoto and confirms or rejects the requested verification. ( Id. ¶ 75.) In particular, the App uses an \nartificial intelligence to ol to conduct a facial scan of the photo, extract geomet ric data from it, \nand then create a facial template. ( Id. ¶ 76.) \nBIPA regulates private entities’ “collec tion, use, safeguarding, handling, storage, \nretention, and destruction of biometric identifiers and in formation.” 740 ILCS 14/5(g). \nAccording to Dzananovic, Defendants violated BI PA by failing to inform him and other Illinois \nresidents that they were collec ting, storing, and using their biomet ric information and identifiers \nwhen they used the Bumble App. As a result, Dzananovic has sued Defendants on behalf of \nhimself and a class of similarly situated Illinoi s residents who “had their biometric information \nand/or biometric identifiers collected, captured, received, or otherwise obtained, or disclosed by \nDefendants while residing in Illinois.” ( Id. ¶ 113.) \nDISCUSSION \n Defendants argue that the Comp laint must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(2) because the \nCourt lacks personal ju risdiction over them.  \nWhen a defendant moves for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(2), “the pl aintiff bears the \nburden of demonstrating th at jurisdiction exists.” In re Sheehan , 48 F.4th 513, 520 (7th Cir. \n2022) (citation omitted). If the Court holds an ev identiary hearing, the pl aintiff must establish Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n4 \n personal jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evid ence; but when the Courts rules on a motion \nto dismiss without an evidentiary heari ng, the plaintiff need  only establish a prima facie  case of \npersonal jurisdiction. NBA Props., Inc. v. HANWJH , 46 F.4th 614, 620 (7th Cir. 2022). The \nCourt may consider affidavits and jurisdictional discovery to decide whether the plaintiff has \nmade a prima facie  case. Purdue Rsch. Found. , 338 F.3d at 782–83. In addition, the Court \naccepts as true all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint and resolves a ll factual disputes in \nthe record in the plaintiff’s favor. Felland v. Clifton , 682 F.3d 665, 672 (7th Cir. 2012). \nHowever, when the defendant “s ubmit[s] evidence opposing the di strict court’s exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction, the plaintif f[ ] must similarly submit affi rmative evidence supporting the \ncourt’s exercise of jurisdiction.” Matlin v. Spin Master Corp. , 921 F.3d 701, 705 (7th Cir. 2019). \nAnd the Court accepts as true any unrefuted facts in the defe ndant’s supporting materials. GCIU-\nEmp. Ret. Fund v. Goldfarb Corp. , 565 F.3d 1018, 1020 n.1 (7th Cir. 2009). \nGenerally, personal jurisdiction is gove rned by the law of the forum state. Tamburo , 601 \nF.3d at 700; Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1).  Illinois’s long-arm statute aut horizes the exercise of personal \njurisdiction to the full extent of the state and fede ral constitutions. See 735 ILCS 5/2-209(c). \nConsequently, “the state statutory and federal constitutional inquiries merge.” Tamburo , 601 \nF.3d at 700 (citation omitted). The key question “is whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nover the defendants ‘comports with the l imits imposed by federal due process.’” Curry v. \nRevolution Lab’ys, LLC , 949 F.3d 385, 393 (7th Cir. 2020) (quoting Walden v. Fiore , 571 U.S. \n277, 283 (2014)). \nThe Court can exercise either general or sp ecific personal jurisdic tion over a defendant.  \nSheehan , 48 F.4th at 522. In this case, Dzananovic does not contend that the Court has general \njurisdiction over these Defendants,  so the Court limits its pres ent inquiry to whether it has Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n5 \n specific jurisdiction. For the Court to exercise sp ecific personal jurisd iction: (1) “defendants \nmust have purposefully directed their activi ties at the forum state or purposefully availed \nthemselves of the privilege of conducting business in the forum;” (2) “the alleged injury must \narise out of or relate to the defendants’ forum-related activi ties;” and (3) “any exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction must comport with traditional notions of fair play an d substantial justice.” \nId. (citations omitted). \nI. Purposeful Direction or Purposeful Availment The Court first considers whether Defendants purposefully directed  their activities at \nIllinois or purposefully availed th emselves of the privilege of c onducting business in Illinois. The \nCourt addresses each Defendant separately. See Purdue Rsch. Found. , 338 F.3d at 784 (“[E]ach \ndefendant’s contacts with the forum St ate must be assess ed individually.”). \nA. Bumble Trading \nAs to Bumble Trading, Defendants argue that  its alleged operati on of the Bumble App \nand Illinois residents’ unilater al use of the Bumble App does not constitute Bumble Trading \nexpressly aiming or purposefully  directing its conduct toward Il linois. Specifically, Defendants \nassert that the Bumble App is a globally ac cessible platform and th e alleged collection of \nbiometric information using the App’s photo verification feature is not targeted at Illinois \nresidents. Defendants appear to concede that Bu mble Trading’s purported marketing activities in \nIllinois constitute purposeful direction or purposef ul availment, since they contend only that \nDzananovic’s BIPA claim does not arise from Bumble Trad ing’s marketing activ ities in Illinois. \nIndeed, Defendants admit that Bumble Trading operates the Bumble App and that it has \nconducted marketing activities in Il linois as part of its nationwi de advertising campaign for the \nBumble App. (Defs.’ Mem., Ex. 1, Rosas Decl. ¶¶ 13–14, Dkt. No. 30-1.) Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n6 \n Purposeful direction or purpos eful availment “focus[es] on th e acts and activities of the \ndefendant,” meaning that “speci fic personal jurisdiction cannot de pend solely on the actions of \nthe plaintiff or third parties.” Sheehan , 48 F.4th at 522–23 (citations omitted). In essence, the \ndefendant’s contacts with the fo rum state must not be  predicated on the “r andom, fortuitous, or \nattenuated contacts he makes by interacting with othe r persons affiliated with the State.” Id. at \n523 (quoting Walden , 571 U.S. at 286). Nonetheless, physical  presence in the fo rum state is not \nrequired for the defendant to have sufficient minimum contacts with the forum state. NBA \nProps. , 46 F.4th at 624. And the Seventh Circuit has refused “to fashion a special jurisdictional \ntest for Internet-based cases.” Curry , 949 F.3d at 398 (citation omitte d). That said, a defendant’s \nmere operation or ownership of an  interactive website that is just accessible in the forum state \nshould not subject the defendant to  jurisdiction, without the defenda nt targeting the forum state. \nSee id.  at 400. Yet “[a] defendant’s deliberate and continuous exploitation of the market in a \nforum state, accomplished through its website as well as through other contacts with the state, \ncan be sufficient to establis h specific personal jurisdiction.”  Mobile Anesthesiologists Chi., LLC \nv. Anesthesia Assocs. of Hous. Metroplex, P.A. , 623 F.3d 440, 446 (7th Cir. 2010). \nThe Seventh Circuit’s decision in uBID, Inc. v. GoDaddy Group, Inc. , 623 F.3d 421 (7th \nCir. 2010), is instructive here. In uBID , a federal district court in Il linois had dismissed an action  \nagainst the operator of the domain name registration website  GoDaddy for lack of personal \njurisdiction. Id. at 425. In reversing the lower court’s di smissal, the Seventh Circuit found that \nthe district court did have pers onal jurisdiction over the defendant, citing “extensive marketing in \nIllinois and sales to Illinois customers.” Id. at 427. In a nutshell, th e Seventh Circuit concluded \nthat the defendant had deliberatel y exploited the Illinois market vi a its sales and advertisements \nto Illinois, even though it did not specifically target Illinois customers in its advertising. Id. at Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n7 \n 427–28; see also be2 LLC v. Ivanov , 642 F.3d 555, 559 (7th Cir. 2011) (describing the defendant \nin uBID  as “massive[ly] and successful[ly]” ex ploiting the Illinois market “through an \nadvertising campaign that produced  hundreds of thousands of custom ers in the state and millions \nof dollars in annual revenues”). Further, the Se venth Circuit rejected the defendant’s argument \nthat its sale of domain names to Illinois customer s were transactions unilaterally initiated by the \ncustomers since it “itself set the system up this way.”  uBID , 623 F.3d at 428–29. \nSimilarly, here, the Court finds that Bumble  Trading purposefully availed itself of the \nIllinois market for its dating a pp services by deliberately an d continuously exploiting that \nmarket. Defendants do not challenge Dzananovic’ s allegation that the Bumble App generates \nrevenue from thousands of paying us ers who are Illinois residents. ( See Am. Compl. ¶ 34.) To \nput a figure to this po tential revenue amount, in  the third quarter of 2021, the Bumble App is \nalleged to have had an average revenue of $30.99 per paying user. ( Id.) In addition, Bumble \nTrading has a nationwide advertis ing campaign for the Bu mble App (Rosas Decl. ¶ 14), and has \nconducted extensive marketing in Illinois ( see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 39–50). For instance, Bumble \nTrading has advertised the Bumble App on physi cal billboards in Chicago, launched verified \nphysical locations in Chicago cal led “BumbleSpot[s]” where peopl e can meet their matches and \nmingle safely, offered “DiningOut Passbooks” to users in Chicago, hosted happy hour events in \nChicago for individuals with Bumble profiles, conducted pri ze drawings for free dates for \nChicago users, sponsored booths at Chicago’s Lollapalooza festiv al, promoted and advertised \nsuccess stories of couples from Chicago who met on the App on their website, and employed \ncampus ambassadors at universities in Chica go to market and prom ote the app on their \ncampuses. ( Id. ¶¶ 39–50.) Moreover, Bumble Trading doe s not dispute Dzananovic’s assertion \nthat it collects PII from users for targeted mark eting purposes, including to personalize potential Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n8 \n matches, inform its product pipelin e, and identify users who are li kely to become paying users. \n(Id. ¶¶ 71, 83.) \nDefendants attempt to distinguish uBID  from the present case on the grounds that \nBumble Trading does not sell or ship products or  services to Illinois re sidents, and that any \nsubsequent steps after the user downloads th e App are user-driven, including using the photo \nverification feature. These argum ents are unpersuasive. As an initial matter, notwithstanding \nDefendants’ selective quotati ons, the Seventh Circuit in uBID did not hold that internet sales \ncould not be described as unilateral if the seller took significant steps both before and after sales; \ninstead, it summarized a previous ruling in another case in suppor t of the well-taken observation \nthat a defendant cannot set up a system so that customers in a state can take advantage of the \ndefendant’s services and then suggest that the cu stomers’ decisions to do so (with millions of \ndollars flowing to the defendant as a result) was “all their idea.” See uBID , 623 F.3d at 428 (“ See \nState of Illinois v. Hemi Group , 622 F.3d at 758–59 (misleading to describe internet sales as \n‘unilateral’ on part of  customers where seller took signi ficant steps both before and after \nsales).”). In any case, uBID  should not be interpreted as narro wly as Defendants suggest, as the \nmain point from the case is that the defendant  had exploited the Illi nois market through its \nadvertising campaign and signifi cant revenue from sales to its numerous Illinois customers. See \nNBA Props. , 46 F.4th at 622 (describing uBID ’s holding); be2 LLC , 642 F.3d at 559 (same). And \nmoreover, Bumble Trading’s alle ged collection and use of users’  PII for targeted marketing \nrefutes Defendants’ argument that  all the interactions after the user downloads the App are user-\ndriven.  \nIn sum, Dzananovic has made a sufficient showing that Bumble Trading purposefully \ndirected its activities toward Illinois and purpos efully availed itself of the Illinois market. Cf. Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 8 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n9 \n Chien v. Bumble Inc. , No. 3:22-cv-00020-GPC-NLS, 2022 WL 17069842, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. \nNov. 17, 2022) (determining that Bumble Trading continuously and deliber ately exploited the \nCalifornia market because the Bumble App was highly interactive, Bumble generated revenue \nfrom thousands of paying users in California, Bumble Trading collected personal and location \ninformation from California users to send target ed marketing and promotions, and the Bumble \nApp has forum-specific conten t such as displaying other users within the forum).  \nB. Bumble, Inc. and Buzz Holdings \nTurning to Bumble, Inc. and Buzz Holdings, Defendants contend that those entities did \nnot purposefully direct their activities toward Il linois because they are holding companies that do \nnot conduct any operating business whatsoever. \nIn the Complaint, Dzananovic alleges that Bumble, Inc. ow ns and operates the Bumble \nApp, derives revenue from the App, directs and controls the operat ions of Bumble Trading, is a \nparty to the App’s terms and conditions, and is  involved in the marketing of the App. ( See Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 14–16, 19, 21, 39–51.) As to Buzz Holdi ngs, Dzananovic also alleges that Buzz \nHoldings operates the Bumble App, derives revenue from paying users on the App, and is \ninvolved in the marketing of the App. ( See id.  ¶¶ 22, 34, 39–51.) Defendants,  in turn, contest \nthose allegations and offer in support Bumble In c.’s filings with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (“SEC”) and corporate governance gui delines as well as a declaration from \nChristopher Rosas, Bumble Trad ing’s Vice President of Tax a nd Treasury. Rosas states that \nBumble Inc. and Buzz Holdings are holding co mpanies that do not conduct any operating \nbusiness, that they do not generate any revenue from Illinois or elsewh ere, that they do not \nmarket the Bumble App, that they do not contro l or operate the Bumble App, and that they do \nnot collect or store information from Bumble App users. ( See Rosas Decl. ¶¶ 6, 9–12.) Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n10 \n Defendants further assert that th e SEC filings do not state that Buzz Holdings and Bumble Inc. \noperate the Bumble App.  \nConversely, Dzananovic points to a declaration in a separate  litigation from Caroline \nRoche, Bumble Trading’s Chief of Staff in 2021, wher e she states that Bumble , Inc. is the parent \ncompany of Bumble Trading, is in volved in the marketing decisions  of its subsidiaries, and is a \nparty to the Bumble App’s term s and conditions. (Pl.’s Resp. Br ., Ex. A, Roche Decl. ¶ 3, Dkt. \n34-1.) Additionally, despite Defe ndants’ protestations to th e contrary, the SEC filings \nspecifically describe Buzz Holdings and Bumble  Inc. as “providing onl ine dating and social \nnetworking platforms through subs cription and credit-based dati ng products” through “websites \nand applications that it owns and operates.” (D efs.’ Reply Br., Ex. A,  2020 SEC 10-K Filing at \n85, Dkt. No. 36-1; Defs.’ Reply Br., Ex. C, 2021 SEC 10-K Filing at 88, Dkt. No. 36-3.) The \nSEC filings further note that  Bumble operates the Bumble App, Bumble conducts brand \nmarketing and field marketing such as sponsorships and bran d ambassadorships, and Bumble \nemploys machine and deep learni ng to personalize user matches and inform its product pipeline. \n(2020 SEC 10-K Filing at 9–10, 12, 24, 54; 2021 SEC 10-K Filing at 9–10, 12, 24.) While \nDefendants claim that those statements do not refer to Bumble, Inc. or Buzz Holdings, the filings define “Bumble” or “[W]e” as re ferring to “Bumble, Inc. and its  consolidated subsidiaries.” \n(2020 SEC 10-K Filing at 5; 2021 SEC 10-K Filing at 5.) Without any additional information, \nthose statements describing Bumble’s activit ies plausibly include Bumble, Inc. and Buzz \nHoldings. \nResolving factual disputes in the filings and declarations in Dzananovic’s favor for \npresent purposes, Bumble, Inc. and Buzz Holdings have a role in the ope ration and marketing of \nthe Bumble App and leveraging of user data for targeted marketing. Thus, for the same reasons Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n11 \n as with respect to Bumble Tr ading, the Court concludes that Bumble, Inc. and Buzz Holdings \npurposefully availed themselves of  the Illinois market and purposef ully directed their activities \ntoward Illinois. Cf. Chien , 2022 WL 17069842, at *9–10 (finding pers onal jurisdiction at the \nmotion to dismiss stage and concluding that Bumb le, Inc. purposefully directed its activities \ntoward California in its capacity as a pa rent corporation and wa s involved in operating, \ndeveloping, marketing, and contro lling the Bumble App in light of the Roche declaration and \nSEC filings).1 \nII. “Arise Out of” or “Relate to” Defendants’ Forum Contacts \nThe Court next addresses whether Dzananovi c’s claim arises out of or relates to \nDefendants’ forum-related activit ies. Defendants argue that D zananovic’s BIPA claim, which \npertains to Defendants’ allege d collection of his biometric information thr ough the Bumble \nApp’s photo verification feat ure, does not arise out of or relate  to Bumble Trading’s marketing of \nthe App.  \nA “defendant’s minimum contacts with th e forum state [must] be suit-related.” Curry , \n949 F.3d at 400 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Bu t a strict causal connection \nbetween the defendant’s in-state activity and the plaintiff’s suit is not required. Ford Motor Co. \nv. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct. , 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1026 (2021); see also  NBA Props. , 46 F.4th at \n626 n.18 (noting that th e Supreme Court in Ford  rejected a direct causal inquiry for the “arising \nout of or related to” requiremen t of specific jurisdiction). While the “arise out of” prong “asks \nabout causation,” the “relate to ” prong “contemplates that so me relationships will support \n \n1 With respect to Buzz Holdings, the court in Chien  found that it did not have specific jurisdiction over it \nbecause the plaintiff’s complaint raised allegations  against Bumble Holding Limited of the United \nKingdom and not Buzz Holdings, despite the plaintiff confusingly identifying Buzz Holdings as a \ndefendant in the case caption. Chien , 2022 WL 17069842, at *5, *7. Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n12 \n jurisdiction without a causal showing.” Ford , 141 S. Ct. at 1026 (holdi ng that the plaintiffs’ \nproduct liability claims regarding injuries from de fective vehicles were closely related to the \ndefendants’ systematic servicing of the markets for those vehicles  in the forum states, despite \ndefendants not designing or manufact uring the vehicles in those stat es). That said, the “relate to” \nprong “incorporates real limits,” such that  not just any relationship will suffice.  See id. Simply \nput, “due process requires only th at the relationship among the de fendant, the forum[s], and the \nlitigation—is close enough to s upport specific jurisdiction.” NBA Props. , 46 F.4th at 626 n.18 \n(quoting Ford , 141 S. Ct. at 1032 (citation omitted)). \nDefendants cite Gullen v. Facebook.com, Inc. , No. 15 C 7681, 2016 WL 245910 (N.D. \nIll. Jan. 21, 2016), for their conten tion that a defendant’s marke ting and sales activities in a \nforum state are unrelated to alle gations of unlawful collection of biometric data in violation of \nBIPA. In Gullen , the plaintiff alleged th at Facebook.com, Inc. viol ated BIPA by obtaining his \nbiometric data from a photo of  him on the website using its “tag suggestion feature.” Id. at *1. \nThe court determined that although the defendant maintained a sales and advertising office in \nIllinois, that contact had no rela tionship to the plaint iff’s suit, which aros e from the defendant’s \n“alleged collection of biometric data from a photo, not from its sales,  marketing, or other \nbusiness activity in Illinois.” Id. at *2. But  Gullen  is readily distinguishab le from the allegations \nhere. Notably, Gullen  is a pre- Ford decision and, in any case, it would not be controlling \nprecedent for this Court. Additionally, Defendants’ forum-related activities are not limited just to \nmarketing the Bumble App in Illinois; rather , their forum-related activities also include \nexploitation of the Illinois ma rket for dating app services through its thousa nds of paying \ncustomers in Illinois and resul ting revenue. Further, the “tag suggestion feature” at issue in \nGullen  had nothing to do with the marketing and advertising of the defendant’s platform. Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n13 \n By contrast, there is a substantial connecti on between Defendants’ marketing activity and \nexploitation of the Illinois market and their allege d collection of biometric data via the “optional” \nphoto verification feature.2 According to Dzananovic, Bumb le is known for providing users \ngreater privacy and safety than comparable  dating apps. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 4–5.) Based on \nDzananovic’s allegations, the photo verification feature is part of  Defendants’ marketing strategy \nfor the Bumble App and how they attract users. In particular, Defendants promote the feature as \na way for users to connect with their matches comf ortably, catch fake profil es, and to ensure that \nthe person that they matched w ith is actually that person. ( See id.  ¶¶ 29, 36.) Indeed, in \nDefendants’ SEC filings, they em phasize that they “w ere among the first majo r dating apps to \nintroduce automated photo verification as a safe ty feature.” (2020 SEC 10-K Filing at 9; 2021 \nSEC 10-K Filing at 9.)  \nAt its core, Dzananovic’s suit is about De fendants deployment of the Bumble App’s \nphoto verification feature to coll ect his biometric in formation, which relates to Defendants’ \nmarketing of the Bumble App and its efforts to e xploit the Illinois market for dating app services, \nbecause the feature is a means to  entice users to the platform. Cf. Kukovec v. Estee Lauder Cos., \nInc., No. 22 CV 1988, 2022 WL 16744196, at *1, *4 (N .D. Ill. Nov. 7, 2022) (concluding that \nthe plaintiff’s BIPA suit—which alleged that the defendant’s optional makeup try-on tool on its \nwebsite collected her facial-geometry data—relat ed to the defendant’s sale of cosmetics in \nIllinois because the virtual try-on tool was part of the defendant’s sale s and marketing of its \ncosmetics); uBID , 623 F.3d at 430–31 (finding that the defend ant’s Illinois contacts related to the \nplaintiff’s claims because the de fendant reached its thousands of customers in Illinois with its \n \n2 It is unclear whether the photo verification feature is fully optional. Although Dzananovic alleges that \nuse of the feature is optional yet encouraged, he also  asserts that Defendants occasionally require users to \nverify themselves by providing a photo of themselves. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 29, 75.) Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n14 \n advertising by offering “free parkin g of a registrant’s domain nam e” and the plaintiff alleged that \nthe defendant used free parked pages with bad -faith intent to profit from the plaintiff’s \ntrademarks). Defendants have pr esented no authority suggesting th at marketing activity in the \nforum state must specifically me ntion a specific feature or benefi t of a platform, such as the \nphoto verification feature, for a connection to exist between the marketing ac tivity and the \nplaintiff’s claim—especially when th e feature is promoted nationally.  \nAccordingly, the Court determines that Dzan anovic’s BIPA claim re lates to Defendants’ \nforum activities. \nIII. Traditional Notions of Fa ir Play and Substantial Justice \nFinally, the Court considers whether exer cising jurisdiction ove r Defendants would \noffend traditional notions of fair  play and substantial justice. Defendants argue that this Court \nexercising jurisdiction over Defe ndants in Illinois would be unreas onable for three main reasons: \n(1) Defendants are entities formed  under the laws of Delaware w ith their principal places of \nbusiness in Texas; (2) the Bumble App is ava ilable worldwide and Bumble Trading conducts the \nsame marketing activities in Illinois as it does in other st ates; and (3) none of the Defendants \nhave offices or prope rty in Illinois.  \nIn evaluating the fairness factor, courts asse ss: the “burden on the defendant, the forum \nState’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plai ntiff’s interest in obtaining convenient and \neffective relief, the interstate judicial system’s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution \nof the underlying dispute, and the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental \nsubstantive social policies.” NBA Props. , 46 F.4th at 627 (citations om itted). If the defendant has \npurposefully directed his activities at the forum state, “he must present a compelling case  that the Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 14 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n15 \n presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.” Id. (emphasis \nadded) (quoting Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 477 (1985)). \nHere, the Court finds that exercising ju risdiction over Defendants would not be \nunreasonable or unfair. Other than being out-of- state defendants, Defend ants do not claim any \nunusual burden in defending suit in Illinois. In addition, Defendants are multi-million-dollar \nentities with global reach, which milita tes against a finding of unfairness. Cf. Curry, 949 F.3d at \n402 (finding that the burden on the defendant to defend a suit in Illinois was minima l, despite the \ndefendant’s lack of physical presence in Illin ois, because it structur ed its marketing and \nnationwide business model to easi ly serve Illinois consumers); uBID , 623 F.3d at 432 (noting \nthat the defendant had a minimal burden in  defending suit since it was a sophisticated \ncorporation with a national reach); Illinois v. Hemi Group LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 760 (7th Cir. \n2010) (concluding that exercising ju risdiction over the defendant was fair where the defendant \nhad established an “expansive, sophisticated commercial venture online,” “held itself out to \nconduct business nationwide,” and succeeded in  “reaching customers across the country”). \nFurther, Illinois has an interest in providing a forum for its residents, such as Dzananovic and \nother class members, to seek redress for the coll ection of their biometric information in violation \nof BIPA, an Illinois statute. \nDefendants rely on Advanced Tactical Ordnance Systems,  LLC v. Real Action Paintball, \nInc., 751 F.3d 796, 803 (7th Cir. 2014), for the pr oposition that it would offend traditional \nnotions of fair play and substant ial justice to subject a defendant with an interactive website to \npersonal jurisdiction in every state where that website is accessible. As discussed above, \nhowever, Defendants have done more than just make the Bumble App accessible in Illinois; Case: 1:21-cv-06925 Document #: 51 Filed: 07/07/23 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:<pageID> \n16 \n \nspecifically, Defendants have used the Bumble A pp to purposefully avail itself of the Illinois \nmarket and have conducted target ing marketing in Illinois.  \nTherefore, the Court concludes that exer cising personal jurisdiction over Defendants \ncomports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. \nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Defe ndants’ motion to dismiss (Dkt. No. 29) is \ndenied. \nENTERED: \n \n  \nDated:  July 7, 2023 __________________________  Andrea R.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a class-action lawsuit against Macy’s Retail Holdings, LLC, for allegedly using AI technology to identify individuals from surveillance footage by accessing the Clearview AI database, which contains biometric data harvested from images scraped from the internet. The plaintiffs allege that Macy’s violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), California, and New York laws by using this database without consent. The court partially granted and partially denied Macy's motion to dismiss, dismissing some state law claims but allowing the BIPA and many other claims to proceed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Macy’s violated biometric privacy laws by allegedly using Clearview AI’s database to collect and profit from individuals’ biometric information without consent.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged violations under BIPA, stating Macy's unauthorized use constituted a concrete injury giving the plaintiffs standing. However, some claims under California’s Unfair Competition Law and New York’s common law for unjust enrichment were dismissed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine Macy's used secret AI software to look at millions of online photos to find out who was in their store videos. People sued Macy's because they didn't know or agree to let their faces be used like this. The court said the people suing had enough reason to be upset (like their privacy was invaded), so the case can keep going, but some of their other complaints weren’t strong enough to continue.",

(“BIPA”) , along with claims \nunder California  and New York  law.  Before the Court is Macy’s motion to dismiss brought \npursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  For the following reasons,  the \nCourt grants in part and denies in part Macy’s motion.   Specifically, the Court grants Macy’s motion \nas to Count Ten, which alleges a claim under California’s Unfair Competition Law , as well as \nplaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim based on New York com mon law in Count Fifteen.  The Court \ndenies the remainder of Macy’s motion.  \nBackground  \n \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its prior rulings in this multi -district litigation.  In their  \ncomplaint, plaintiffs contend that the Clearview defendants covertly scraped billions of  photographs \nof facial images from the internet and then used artificial intelligence algorithms to scan the face \ngeometry of each individual depicted in the photographs to harvest the individuals’ unique biometric \nidentifiers and corres ponding biometric information.  P laintiffs further assert  that the Clearview \ndefendants created a searchable database containing their biometrics that  allowed users  to identify \nunknown individuals merely by uploading a photograph to the database.  The data base can be \nsearched remotely by licensed users of the Clearview web application.   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 1 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Defendant Macy’s is a private corporation  that purchased access to the  Clearview  database \nand the biometrics contained therein to identify people whose images appeared in surveillance \ncamera footage from Macy’s retail stores.  Plaintiffs  assert  that Macy’s utilized Clearview’s database \nover 6,000 times, each time uploading an image to  the database to  search for a match.  Furthermore, \nplaintiffs contend t hat Macy’s is similarly situated to other database users which comprise the \nClearview Client class:  \nAll non- governmental, private entities – including  publicly -traded companies – who \npurchased access to, or otherwise obtained, the  Biometric Database and then utilized \nthe database to run biometric searches at a  time when the Biometrics of one or more \nof the named Plaintiffs had already been captured, collected or obtained, and \nsubsequentl y stored, by the Clearview  Defendants.  \n \nIn their complaint, plaintiffs bring a BIPA claim against Macy’s under 740 ILCS 14/15(b) , \nwhich prohibits private entities from collectin g, capturing, purchasing, receiving through trade, or \notherwise obtaining a person’s biometric identifiers or information without first providing notice \nand consent.  Similarly, plaintiffs bring a BIPA claim under 7 40 ILCS 14/15(c) , which  prohibit s \nprivate entities from  selling, leasing, trading, or profiting from a person’s biometric identifiers or \ninformation.   Plaintiffs also bring statutory and common law claims against Macy’s  under California  \nand New York law . \nLegal Standard s \nA Rule  12(b)(1) motion challenges federal jurisdiction, and the party invoking jurisdiction \nbears the burden of establishing the elements necessary for subject matter jurisdiction, including \nstanding .  Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc. , 984 F.3d 1241, 1244 ( 7th Cir. 2021) ; International  Union  of \nOperating  Eng’rs v. Daley , 983 F.3d 287, 294 (7th Cir. 2020) .  Under  Rule 12(b)(1), the Court accepts \nthe w ell-pleaded factual allegations as true and construes all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff ’s \nfavor when a defendant has facially attack ed standing .  Prairie Rivers Network v. Dynegy Midwest \nGeneration, LLC , 2 F.4th 1002, 1007 ( 7th Cir. 2021).   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 2 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n A motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim tests the \nsufficiency of the complaint, not its merits .  Skinner v. Switzer , 562 U.S. 521, 529, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 \nL.Ed.2d  233 (2011).  When considering dismissal of a complaint, the Court accepts all well -pleaded \nfactual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in fav or of the plaintiff.  Erickson v. \nPardus , 551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam ).  To survive a motion \nto dismiss, plaintiff must “state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U .S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).  A complaint is facially plausible \nwhen the plaintiff alleges  enough “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable \ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”   Ashcroft  v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678, \n129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).  \nDiscu ssion  \nArticle III Standing  \nMacy’s first argues that the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction by challeng ing \nplaintiffs ’ Article III standing to bring their BIPA 15(b) and 15(c)  claims  as alleged in Counts One \nand Three  of the  first amended  consolidated class action complaint .  “Article III of the Constitution \nlimits the federal judicial power to deciding ‘ Cases ’ and ‘ Controversies’” and “as an essential part of \na federal court ’s authority under Article III, [the] standing doctrine ensures respect for these \njurisdictional bounds.”  Prairie Rivers Network, 2 F.4th at 1007.  To establish standing under Article \nIII, a plaintiff must show: (1) he suffered an injury -in-fact; (2) that is fairly traceable to defendant’s \nconduct; and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.   Protect Our Parks, Inc. v. \nChicago Park Dist. , 971 F.3d 722, 729 ( 7th Cir . 2020) (Barrett, J.). \nIn its motion, Macy’s contends  that plaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing because \nthey have failed to sufficiently allege a concrete and particularized injury -in-fact.  To determine \nwhether the disclosure of plaintiffs’ private information without their consent caused a sufficiently Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 3 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n concrete harm to support standing , the Court  look s to both history and the judgment of Congress  \nfor guidance.  Gadelhak  v. AT&T Servs.,  Inc., 950 F.3d 458, 462 (7th Cir. 2020) (Bar rett, J.) .  The \nhistorical inquiry asks, “whether the asserted harm has a ‘close relationship’ to a harm traditionally \nrecognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts —such as physical harm, monetary \nharm, or various intangible harms.”  Tran sUnion , LLC v. Ramirez , 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2200 (2021) .  As the \nTransUnion Court explained , “[v]arious intangible harms can also be concrete” including \n“reputational harms, disclosure of private information, and intrusion upon seclusion.” Id.  at 2204.   \nHere, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that defendant’s use of their private information \nwitho ut the opportunity to give their consent  as required  under BIPA 15(b)  caused them the \nconcrete harm of violating their privacy interests in their biometric data.  See Bryant v. Compass Group \nUSA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, 627  (7th Cir. 2020)  (defendants “inflicted the concrete injury BIPA \nintended to protect against,  i.e. a consumer ’s loss of the power and ability to make  informed \ndecisions about the collection, storage, and use of her biometric information.”) .  Therefore, plaintiffs \nhave suf ficiently alleged a concrete injury -in-fact for Article III standing purposes.  \nLikewise, plaintiffs have  sufficiently stated a concrete injury -in-fact under BIPA 15(c)  by \nalleging that Macy’s profited  from  using the Clearview database to prevent losses and improve \ncustomer experience , and, that as a result of Macy’s use, plaintiffs’ biometric information was  \ncompromised.   Contrary to Macy’s argument that it merely uploaded photographs onto the \nClearview dat abase, plaintiffs allege that Macy’s purchased, obtained, accessed, and used the \nbiometrics in the database and profited from that conduct.  Meanwhile , Macy’s reliance on the \nSeventh Circuit’s decision in Thornley  is misplaced because in that matter , the plaintiffs purposely  \navoided federal court jurisdiction by bringing bare BIPA 15(c) claims alleging that they were not \ninjured as a result of any BIPA violations .  See Thornley , 984 F.3d at 1246; Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc. , \nNo. 20- cv-3843, 2020 WL 6262356, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2020) (Coleman, J.) (“ Plaintiffs Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 4 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n purposely narrowed their claim to the general prohibition of Clearview selling and profit ing from \nplaintiffs’ biometric data and filed their lawsuit in state court where such actions are allowed without \nthe constraints of Article III  standing .”); see also Rosenbach  v. Six Flags  Enter.  Corp.,  129 N.E.3d 1197, \n1207, 432 Ill.Dec. 654, 664 (Ill. 2019) (“an individual need not allege some actual injury or adverse \neffect, beyond violation of his or her rights under the Act, in order to qualify as an ‘aggrieved’ \nperson.”).   Such is not the  case here . \nThe Court turns to the other factors of Article III standing, namely, that the injuries alleged \nare fa irly traceable to Macy’s conduct  and that the injur ies are likely to be redressed by a favorable \njudicial decision .  In its motion, Macy’s argues that the  relief plaintiffs seek has no bearing on their \nneed to protect their biometric information because Macy’s does not “possess” this information.  \nViewing the allegations in plaintiffs’ favor, they have alleged that Macy’s has done more than merely \npossess their photos, including  that Macy’s used the Clearview database to obtain the biometrics of \nmillions of Illinois residents for comparing the data against the photographs Macy’s uploaded.  With \nthese allegations in mind, Macy’s cannot point the fing er at the Clearview defendants and then \nignore its own conduct in using the Clearview database.  Moreover, “ the prospect of statutory \ndamages shows that such an injury is r edressable .”  Bryant , 958 F.3d at 621.  Macy’s Article III \nstanding argument fails.  \nRule 12(b)(6) Challenges to BIPA Claims  \n \nMacy’s  challenges plaintiffs’ BIPA claims under Rule 12(b)(6) arguing plaintiffs have failed to \nadequately allege these claims under the federal pleading standards per  Iqbal  and Twombly .  First, \nMacy’s argues  plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege their BIPA 15(b) claim because they do not \nallege the who, what, where, when, or how of this claim.  From Macy’s argument, i t appears Macy’s \nis arguing that plaintiffs must fulfill the heightened pleading standard under Rule 9(b), see Mamalakis \nv. Anesthetix M gmt. LLC , 20 F.4th 295, 301 ( 7th Cir. 2021), which is simply not the case.  Meanwhile , Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 5 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n the basis of plaintiffs’ BIPA 15( b) claim is that Macy’s accessed and obtained plaintiffs’ biometric \ninformation without plaintiffs’ knowledge and consent each time Macy’s sought to identify an \nindividual by uploading photos to the Clearview database.  In other words, Macy’s actively purchased access to obtain plaintiffs’ biometrics without comply ing with BIPA 15(b)’s notice and \nconsent requirements.  Cothron v. White Castle Sys ., Inc., 20 F.4th 1156, 1159 ( 7th Cir. 2021)  \n(“Section  15(b) provides that a private entity may not ‘ collect, capture, purchase, receive through \ntrade, or otherwise obtain’  a person’ s biometric data without first providing  notice  to and \nreceiving  consent  from the person. ”).  Thus, plaintiffs have plausibly alleged their BIPA 15(b) \nviolation against Macy’s.   \nMacy’s also takes issue with plaintiffs’ BIPA 15(c) allegations arguing that  plaintiffs have not \nalleged M acy’s possesse d their biometric information and that plaintiffs did not provide sufficient \nfactual details that Macy’s profited from this information.  Despite these arguments, plaintiffs have adequately alleged t hat Macy’s obtained access to their biometric information and searched  the \nClearview database resulting in Macy’s o btain ing, access ing, and us ing the biometrics in the database.  \nPlaintiffs also allege that Macy’s used this information for their own business purposes  and profited \nfrom its use.  From plaintiffs’ allegations, it is reasonable to infer that plaintiffs’ biometric information was necessary to Macy’s loss prevention business model  and that th is biometric \ninformation generated profits by reducing the number of stolen goods.  Accordingly, plaintiffs’ have \nplausibly alleged their BIPA 15(c) claim against Macy’s.  \nCalifor nia State Law Claim s \n In Count s Ten through Thirteen, plaintiff Andrea Vestrand,  on behalf of herself and others \nsimilarly situated in the California Subclass , brings claims under California statutory and common \nlaw.  In Count Ten, Vestrand alleges that Macy’s violated  California’s Unfair Competition Law \n(“UCL”).  To bring a claim under the UCL, a plaintiff  must “(1) establish a loss or deprivation of Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 6 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n money or property sufficient to quantify as injury in fact, i.e.,  economic  injury , and (2) show that  the \neconomic injury was the result of, i.e., caused  by, the unfair business practice.”  Kwikset  Corp.  v. Superior  \nCourt , 51 Cal . 4th 310, 322, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877 ( Cal. 2011) (emphasis in original) .  \nMacy’s maintains  that plaintiffs’ UCL claim necessarily fails because personal information is \nnot “property” for purposes of the UCL .  See In re Facebook Privacy Litig. , 791 F.Supp.2d 705, 714 \n(N.D. Cal. 2011) .  The Court agrees.  In deed, “[n]umerous courts have held that disclosure  of \npersonal information alone does not constitute economic or  property  loss sufficient to \nestablish  UCL  standing, unless the plaintiff provides specific allegations regarding the value of the \ninformation. ”  Mastel v. Miniclip SA , ___ F.Supp.3d  ___, 2021 WL 2983198, at *11 (E.D. Cal. 2021) .   \nMoreover, Macy’s contends  plaintiffs’ UCL claim does not survive the present motion to \ndismiss because plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege an unfair business practice for purposes of \nthe UCL.   The UCL “governs ‘ anti-competitive  business practices’ as well as injuries to consumers, \nand has as a major purpose ‘the preservation of fair business competition.’”  Chu v. Old Republic Home \nProtection C o., Inc., 274 Cal.Rptr.3d 528, 536, 60 Cal.App.5th 346, 357 (Cal. 2021).  In short, the  \n“UCL ’s purpose is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in \ncommercial markets for goods and services.”   Erhart v. BofI Holding , Inc.,  387 F.Supp.3d 1046, 1059 \n(S.D.  Cal. 201 9) (citation omitted).  Plaintiffs’ allegations do not involve the protection of fair \ncompetition in commercial markets , therefore , the Court  dismisses plaintiffs’ UCL claim without \nleave t o amend because any such amendment would be futile.  \nIn Count Eleven, Vestrand alleges a commercial misappropriation of likeness claim against \nMacy’s  under California Civil Code § 3344(a) , as well as a common law right to publicity claim in \nCount Twelve.   The Court analyzes Counts Eleven and Twelve together because t o state a claim \nunder § 3 344(a), a plaintiff  must first fulfill the elements of the common law  right to publicity .  See \nDowning  v. Abercrombie &  Fitch,  265 F.3d 994, 1001 (9th Cir. 2001) ; Cross v. Facebook, Inc.,  222 Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 7 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n Cal.Rptr.3d 250, 265, 14 Cal.App.5th 190, 208 (Cal. 2017) (“ Civil Code section  3344 was intended to \ncomplement , not supplant,  common  law claims for right of publicity.”).  \nThe California common law “right of publicity seeks to prevent commercial exploitation of \nan individual ’s identity without that person’ s consent. ”  Maloney v. T3Media, Inc ., 853 F.3d 1004, 1010 \n(9th Cir. 2017) .  The elements of a common law right to privacy claim include : (1) defendant ’s \nunauthorized use of the plaintiff ’s identity; (2) the appropriation of plaintiff ’s name or likeness to \ndefendant ’s advantage , commercial or otherwise; and ( 3) the resulting injury.   Downing, 265 F.3d at \n1001; Ross v. Roberts , 166 Cal.Rptr.3d 359, 365, 222 Cal.App.4th 677, 684 (Cal. 2013).   \nMacy’s contends that Vestrand’s common law claim must fail because she did not allege she \nhas a commercial interest or value in her likeness.  Vestrand, however, is not required to plead f acts \ncorresponding to each legal element of her claim to survive a motion to dismiss, but instead, need \nonly allege a plausible claim.  Chapman  v. Yellow  Cab Cooperative , 875 F.3d  846, 848 (7th  Cir. 2017) .  \nVestrand has done so by alleging that Macy’s used her photographs and likeness without \nauthorization for commercial gai n via Macy’s loss prevention business model.  Further, Vestrand \nalleges the California Subclass was injured because Macy’s did not compensate them for its  use of \ntheir likeness es, identifies, and photographs.  These allegations plausibly state a common law right to \npublicity claim under California law.  \nNext, under Cal ifornia’s statutory remedy, § 3344,  plaintiffs must also show  “a knowing use \nby the defendant as well as a direct connection between the alleged use and the commercial \npurpose.”  Downing , 265 F.3d at 1001.  In its motion, Macy’s maintains that §  3344 requires plaintiffs \nto allege that its use of the Clearview database was  for purposes of advertising, selling, or soliciting.  \nMacy’s, however, ignores parts of § 3344(a), which states , “[a]ny person who knowingly uses \nanother ’s name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness in any manne r, on or in products, \nmerchandise, or goods, or for purposes of advertising or selling, or  soliciting purchases of, products, Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 8 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n merchandise, goods or services, without such person’ s prior consent, or, in the case of a minor, the \nprior consent of his parent or legal guardian, shall be liable for any damages sustained by the person \nor persons injured as a result thereof. ” (emphasis added).   Therefore,  under §  3344, plaintiffs need \nnot allege that Macy’s used their photos or likenesses for purposes of advertising, selling, or \nsoliciting.  And , as discussed, plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Macy’s knowingly used their \nphotos by accessing the Clearview database to achieve Macy’s loss prevention goals.  The Court \ndenies Macy’s motion to dismiss Counts Eleven and Twelve.  \nIn Count Thirteen, Vestrand alleges that Macy’s violated her right to privacy under the \nCalifornia Constitution.   To establish a claim for invasion of privacy under the California \nConstitution,  a plaintiff must eventually show (1) she  possess es a legally protected privacy interest , \n(2) she maintain s a reasonable expectation of privacy , and (3) defendant’s conduct constituted a \nserious invasion of privacy.  Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 865 P.2d 633, 654- 55, 26 \nCal.Rptr.2d 834, 7 Cal.4th 1 ( Cal. 1994) .  Here, Macy’s asserts plaintiffs failed to adequately allege \nthat Vestrand possessed a legally protected privacy interest.   The California Constitution protects \ntwo separate classes of privacy interests:  (1) information privacy, which includes interests in \nprecl uding the dissemination or misuse of confidential and sensitive information; and (2) autonomy \nprivacy, including interests in making personal decisions or conducting personal activities without \nintrusion.  In re Google Location History Litig ., 514 F.Supp.3d 1147, 1154 (N.D. Cal. 2021)  (citing  Hill, \n865 P.2d at 654) .  Because autonomy privacy protects bodily autonomy, it does not apply under the \ncircumstances.  Se e In re Yahoo Mail Litig ., 7 F.Supp.3d 1016, 1039 (N.D. Cal. 2014) .  The Court thus \nexamines whether plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the first class of privacy interests, information \nprivacy.   \nConstruing  the allegations in plaintiffs’ favor, they have adequately  stated  that Macy’s  \nconduct constituted a serious invasion of their  information privacy .  Plaintiffs allege that Macy’s Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 9 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n purchased access to the Clearview database containing their biometric identifiers.  Biometric \ninformation, by its very nature, is sensitive and confidential.  See Fox v. Dakkota Integrated Sys., LLC , \n980 F.3d 1146, 1155 ( 7th Cir. 2020) (“ biometric identifiers … are immutable, and once \ncompromised, are compromised forever.”) .  Macy’s then accessed, used, and obtained the California \nSubclass members’ confidential and sensitive biometrics.  In addition, plaintiffs allege that the \nCalifornia Subclass had a reasonable expectation of privacy to their highly sensitive biometrics.  \nVestrand has therefore plausibly alleged her right to privacy claim under the California Constitution.   \nNew York Sta te Law Claim  \nIn Count Fourteen, plaintiff Aaron Hurvitz, on behalf of himself and others similarly \nsituated in the New York Subclass, brings  a claim under New York’s Civil Rights Act  § 51.  The \npurpose of § 51 is to protect individuals from the commercial exploitation of their name or image.  \nSee Kuklachev v. Gelfman , 600 F.Supp.2d 437, 474- 75 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) .  To establish liability under  § \n51, a plaintiff must show defendant’s nonconsensual use his name, portrait, picture, or voice within \nthe state of New York for purposes of advertising or trade.  See Electra v. 59 Murray Enter ., Inc., 987 \nF.3d 233, 249 ( 2d Cir. 2021) .    \nWithout citing legal authority, Macy’s first argument is that plaintiffs’ §  51 claim must fail \nbecause they have not alleged that Macy’s took Hurvitz’s picture or the picture of any other \nparticular person.  The plain language of the statut e, however, states that it is the nonconsensual \n“use” of a picture that is prohibited.  See  N.Y. Civil Rights L. § 51; see also Electra,  987 F.3d at 249.   \nMacy’s also argues that its use of plaintiff’s picture was not for trade purposes.  New York \n“courts have defined use ‘ for the purposes of trade ’ as use which ‘ would draw trade to the firm ’ or \n‘use for the purpose of making profit. ’”  Amusement Indus ., Inc. v. Stern , 693 F.Supp.2d 301, 314 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2 010) (citation omitted).  As discussed above, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged plaintiffs’ \nbiometric information was necessary to Macy’s loss prevention business model and that this Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 10 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n biometric information generat ed profits by reducing the number of stolen goods.  Plaintiffs ’ \nallegations have raised their  right to relief above a speculative level , and thus, t he Court denies \nMacy’s motion in this respect.   \nUnjust Enrichment Claim  \nLast, Macy’s moves to dismiss plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim alleged in Count Fifteen of \nthe first amended consolidated class action complaint .  In particular, Macy’s asserts that unjust \nenrichment is not a viable, stand- alone claim under Illinois, California, or New York law.  Under \nIllinois law, unjust enrichment “ is not a separate cause of action that, standing alone, would justify \nan action for recovery.”   Toushin v. Ruggiero , 2021 IL App (1st) 192171, ¶ 80, 2021 WL 2718495, at \n*13 ( 1st Dist.  2021) (quoting  Mulligan v. QVC, Inc., 888 N.E.2d 1190, 1200, 321 Ill.Dec. 257, 267, 382 \nIll.App.3d 620, 631 ( 1st Dist.  2008) .  Rather, unjust enrichment is a condition resulting from \nunlawful or improper conduct like fraud and may be redressed by a cause of action based upon that \nimproper conduct.  Toushin , 2021 IL App (1st) 192171, ¶ 80.   “[I]f an unjust enrichment claim  rests \non the same improper conduct alleged in another claim, then the unjust enrichment claim will be \ntied to this related claim —and, of course, unjust enrichment will stand or  fall with the related claim .”  \nCleary v. Philip Morris Inc ., 656 F.3d 511, 517 ( 7th Cir. 2011) .  Because plaintiffs have sufficiently \nalleged their BIPA claims, the Court denies Macy’s motion to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim \nattendant to the BIPA claims  at this juncture . \nThe Ninth Circuit has explained that a  California common law unjust enrichment claim may \nsurvive either “as an independent cause of action or as a quasi -contract claim for restitution.”    ESG \nCapital Partners, LP v. Stratos , 828 F.3d 1023, 1038 ( 9th Cir. 2016) ; see also Hart v. TWC Product & Tech. \nLLC , 526 F.Supp.3d 592, 604 (N.D. Cal. 2021) .  “To allege unjust enrichment as an independent \ncause of action, a plaintiff must show that the defendant received and unjustly retained a benefit at \nthe plaintiff’s expense.”  ESG Capital, 828 F.3d at 1038.  Here, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 11 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n \nMacy’s was unjustly enriched by using their biometric information without their knowledge and \nconsent . \nLast, Macy’s correctly asserts  plaintiffs’ New York common law unjust enrichment claim s \nare preempted by New York Civil Rights Act §§ 50, 51.  See Sondik v Kimmel,  131 A.D. 3d 1041, 1042, \n16 N.Y.S.3d 296, 298 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015)  (“Common -law unjust  enrichment  claims for the \nunauthorized use of an image or likeness are  preempted  by Civil Rights  Law  §§ 50 and  51.”) ; \nMyskina v. Conde Nast Publ ’n, Inc ., 386 F.Supp.2d 409, 420 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (“ Under New York law, \ncommon law unjust enrichment claims for unauthorized use of an image or likeness are subsumed \nby Sections 50 and  51.”).  The Court grants this aspect of Macy’s motion to dismiss.   \nConclusion  \nFor these reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part defendant’s motion to dismiss \n[111].   \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDate:  1/27/2022  \n      Entered: _____________________________ \n         SHARON JOHNSON COLEMAN \n         United States District Judge  \n Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 272 Filed: 01/27/22 Page 12 of 12 PageID #:<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves Citizens Insurance Company of America, which sought a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated under its policy to defend Wynndalco Enterprises in two class-action lawsuits. These lawsuits filed against Wynndalco alleged violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to the sale of access to an AI-based facial recognition database created by Clearview AI. The court concluded that the language in the insurance policy was ambiguous regarding exclusions for statutory violations, thereby obligating Citizens to defend Wynndalco in the lawsuits.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the statutory exclusion clause in the insurance policy issued by Citizens Insurance precludes coverage for defense against BIPA violation claims.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the statutory violation exclusion in the insurance policy was ambiguous with regards to BIPA violations, and ambiguities in insurance policies should be construed in favor of the insured. Therefore, Citizens must defend Wynndalco against the lawsuits.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you have an insurance policy that promises to help you if you get into certain types of trouble. You get sued because someone says you broke a law about how you use pictures of people’s faces. Your insurance company doesn't want to help because they think the insurance policy doesn't cover this type of problem. The judge looks at the policy and says, \"Hey, the words are confusing and could mean different things.\" The judge decides that if it's unclear, the insurance company has to help you out. So, they have to back you up in court, even if they're not happy about it.",

Wynndalco filed a counterclaim seeking the opposite.   \nNow Cit izens and Wynndalco have filed cross -motions for judgment on the \npleadings.

Undisputed Facts  \nA. The Thornley  and Calderon  Lawsuits  \nThe litigation that prompted this insurance coverage dispute involves the \nsecret collection of more than three billion facial scans by Clearview AI, an artificial \nintelligence company that specializes in facial recognition software .  See 1st Am. \nCompl. (“Compl.”) ¶ 19, ECF No. 20 .

Id.  Clearview AI  also created a facial recognition application (“Clearview \nApp”) that allows its customers  to identify individuals by comparing facial pictures \nthey take to the Clearview Database.  Id.  Wynndalco, an information technology \n(“IT”) services and consulting firm, licensed and sold access to the Clearview \nDatabase and Clearview App to customers in Illinois.

USA, Inc. , 840 F.3d 355, 358 (7th Cir. 2016).  \nThe Court will grant a motion for judgment on the pleadings if “ it appears beyond \ndoubt that the nonmovant cannot prove facts sufficient to support its position, and \nthat the plaintiff is entitled to relief .”  Scottsdale  Ins., 972 F.3d at 919.  \n Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 4 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n III. Analysis  \nAs a preliminary matter, the parties agree that Illinois law applies.   Compare , \ne.g., Citizens’ Mem. Law Supp. Mot. J. Pleadings at 8 (“Citizens’ Mem.”), ECF No. 65, \nwith, e.g., Mem. Law Supp. Wynndalco & Thornley Defs.’ Mots. J. Pleadings & Opp’n \nCitizens’ Mot. J. Pleadings at 9, ECF No. 86.   Furthermore, all material facts are \nundisputed , and Citizen s does not contest that, if it has a duty to defend Wynndalco, \nit also must d efend its officers .  With that , the Court turns to the question at hand, \nnamely, whether the policy Citizen s issued to Wynndalco provides coverage for the \ndefense of the Lawsuits.   See Mashallah, Inc. v. W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co. , 20 F.4th 311, \n319 (7th Cir. 2 021) (“Under Illinois law, the interpretation of an insurance policy, like \nany other contract, is a question of law. ”). \nTo answer this question, the Court must look to the language of the insurance \npolicy.  “ The goal in interpreting an insurance policy is to ascertain and give effect to \nthe intention of the parties, as expressed in the policy language.”   Scottsdale  Ins., 972 \nF.3d at 919 (cleaned up).  Furthermore, under Illinois law, “ insurance policies are to \nbe liberally construed in favor of coverage, and where an ambiguity exists in the \ninsurance contract, it will be resolved in favor of the insured and against the insurer. ”  \nUnited Servs. Auto. Ass ’n v. Dare , 830 N.E.2d 670, 678 ( Ill. App. Ct. 2005) .  At the \nsame time, policy language is not  ambiguous “ simply because the parties disagree as \nto its meaning [,]” and the court should not “strain to find an ambiguity where none \nexists.”  Founders Ins. Co. v. Munoz , 930 N.E.2d 999, 1004 ( Ill. 2010) .   Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 5 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n When seeking coverage, “[a] n insured has the bu rden of proving that a claim \nfalls within the coverage of the policy.  . . . Once the insured satisfies this burden, the \ninsurer has the burden of proving that the loss was limited or excluded by a contract \nprovision. ”  Travelers Pers. Ins. Co. v. Edwards , 48 N.E.3d 298, 303  (Ill. App. Ct. \n2016).  What is more, “[a]n insurer can only refuse to defend if the allegations of the \nunderlying complaint preclude any possibility of coverage.”  Ill. Tool Works, Inc. v. \nTravelers Cas. & Sur. Co. , 26 N.E.3d 421, 428 (I ll. App. Ct. 2015).   But a single \nunequivocal exclusion is sufficient to show that an insurer does not have a duty to \ndefend the insured.  See, e.g. , Hartford Cas. Ins. Co. v. Dental USA, Inc. , No. 13 C \n7637, 2014 WL 2863164, at *4 (N.D. Ill. June 24, 2014)  (applying Illinois law) .   \nFinally, to “ determine whether the insurer ’s duty to defend has arisen, the \ncourt must compare the allegations of the underlying complaint to the policy \nlanguage. ”  Id.  “If the court determines that these allegations fall within, or \npotentially within , the policy ’s coverage, the insurer has a duty to defend the insured \nagainst the underlying complaint. ”  Metzger v. Country Mut. Ins. Co. , 986 N.E.2d 756, \n761 (Ill. App. Ct. 2013) ( cleaned up ).   \nIn this case, the dispute focuses on  whether the Statutory Violation exclusion \npreclude s coverage for the Lawsuits .  The Court begins with the language of the \nexclusion .  As noted above , the Statutory Violation exclusion  disavows  coverage for :  \n[P]ersonal and advertising injury  . . . arising directly or \nindirectly out of any action or omission that violates or is \nalleged to violate  . . . [the TCPA, CAN -SPAM, FCRA, or \nFACTA]  [or a] ny other laws, statutes[,] ordinances [,] or     \nregulations that address, prohibit or  limit the pri nting, \ndissemination, disposal, collecting, recording, sending,  Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 6 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n transmitting, communicating or distribution of material or \ninformation . \n \nPolicy at 92.  Citizens argues, as an initial matter, that this language is not \nambiguous  because BIPA is a “statute” t hat regulates the “ dissemination, disposal, \ncollecting, recording, sending,  transmitting, communicating or distribution of \nmaterial or information .”  Id.  But t he Supreme Court of Illinois  recently  held that a \nnearly identical provision was ambiguous .  W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Krishna \nSchaumburg Tan, Inc. , ___ N.E.3d ____, 2021 WL 2005464, at * 10 (Ill. May 20, 2021) .  \nAs an authoritative construction of Illinois law  by the state’s highest court ,  Krishna ’s \nholding  is binding on this Court unl ess it can be distinguished.  See Kaiser v. Johnson \n& Johnson , 947 F.3d 996, 1013 (7th Cir. 2020).   Citizens’  attempt to do so is not \npersuasive.  \nFirst, Citizens  points out that the  exclusion in  Krishna  had a more specific \ntitle: “Violation of Statutes tha t Govern E -Mails, Fax, Phone Calls or Other Methods \nof Sending Material or Information.”  Citizens ’ Mem. at  11.  Because the Supreme \nCourt of Illinois began the Krishna  analysis with the title of the exclusion, see 2021 \nWL 2005464, at *10, Citizens argues , the case is inapposite.  \nAt the outset, this Court is not convinced that the difference in the titles makes \nthese exclusions substantively different.  See, e.g., First Mercury Ins. Co. v. Triple \nLocation LLC , 536 F.  Supp. 3d 326, 331 –32 (N.D. Ill. 2021)  (referring to the exclusion \nat issue in Krishna  as “materially identical ” to one with the title “Distribution of \nMaterial in Violation of Statutes,” and otherwise identical substance).  But even if \nthe change in title  were  material , Citizens’ argument s would still fail .   Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 7 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n In a literal sense, it is true that BIPA, like the other enumerated statutes, \n“regulates the dissemination, disposal, collecting, recording, sending, transmitting, \ncommunicating or distribution of  . . . information .”  Citizens’ Reply at 6.  But as \nWynndalco observes, reading the exclusion in this way would swallow the rule.  Most \nstatutes “regulate . . . information” to some degree.  To interpret the exclusion to cover \nevery statute that concerns a person or entity doing practically anything whatsoever \nwith “information” would make certain coverage  provisions illusory, including, for \nexample, those that provide coverage for injuries “ arising out of  . . . [o] ral or written \npublication, in any manner, of material that violates a person’s right of privacy.”  \nPolicy at 100.  \nOther provisions of the Policy also belie Citizens’ expansive reading.  See \nFounders  Ins., 930 N.E.2d at 1004 (courts must interpret provisions in light of the \nentire policy).  The Policy explicitly covers slander and libel claims, false advertising \nclaims, and claims for copyright infringement.  See Policy at 100.  These claims also \narise under statutes —such as  the Illinois Slander and Libel Act,  740 I ll. Co mp. Stat. \n145/0.01 et seq ., the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1051 et seq. , and the Copyright Act, 17 \nU.S.C. § 101 et seq. —that “regulate the dissemination . . . or distribution of material \nor information.”  Compl. ¶ 17; see, e.g. , 17 U.S.C. § 106(3) (protecting  the copyright \nowner’s right “ to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the \npublic ”).  Under Citizens’ construction, the Statutory Violation exclusion would bar \ncoverage for violations of the very statutes under which slander, libel, false Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 8 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n advertising, and copyright claims arise.  The Court refuses to adopt such a \nnonsensical reading of the Policy . \nBecause the language of the exclusion is ambiguous  on its face , the Court \nturns, as did  the Supreme Court  of Illinois  in Krishna , to canons  of statutory \nconstruction for guidance .  Unfortunately, these are of limited utility here.   Krishna  \nemployed ejusdem generis , which counsels that, “w here general words follow specific \nwords . . . the general words are [usually] construed to embrace only objects similar \nin nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words. ”  Yates v. \nUnited States , 574 U.S. 528, 545 (2015) (quoting Wash . State Dep’t of Soc. and Health \nServs. v. Gua rdianship Estate of Keffeler , 537 U.S. 371, 384 (2003)  (first alteration \nomitted )); see 2021 WL 2005464, at *10 .  The policy in Krishna  listed only the TCPA , \nthe CAN -SPAM  Act, and the catchall .  2021 WL 2005464, at *10 .  Accordingly, the \nKrishna  court found that BIPA did not fall within the catchall  because, unlike the \nTCPA and the CAN -SPAM Act, BIPA does not regulate “methods of communication.”  \nSee id.  \nIn this case, however, the exclusion also includes FCRA  and FACTA .  Neither \nof these statutes  are directed towards regulating methods of communication.  FCRA \nregulates the credit reporting industry with a purpose “to promote ‘fair and accurate \ncredit reporting ’ and to protect consumer privacy .” TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez , ___ \nU.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 2 190, 2200 (2021) (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 1681(a)).   And FACTA  is \nan amendment to FCRA  that imposes restrictions on the disclosure of credit and debit \naccount information, enacted in response to a perceived increase in identity theft.  Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 9 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n Meyers v. Oneida Tribe o f Indians of Wis. , 836 F.3d 818, 819 –20 (7th Cir. 2016) , cert. \ndenied , 137 S. Ct. 1331 (2017).   Thus, the interpretive tool of ejusdem generis  is \nunhelpful in this case, because ejusdem generis  requires the general term to share a \ncharacteristic that is common to all the specific terms.  See  Saxon v. Sw. Airlines Co. , \n993 F.3d 492, 496 (7th Cir. 2021).2 \nBut, even if the Court were to apply ejusdem generis  here, the result is not \nwhat Citizens advocates.  According to Citizen s, the application of ejusdem generis  \nshows that BIPA is “like” the TCPA,  CAN -SPAM  Act, FCRA, and FACTA because \n“[those statutes] all protect privacy interests generally, and BIPA and the \nFCRA/FACTA more specifically protect against identity theft. ”  Citizens’ Reply Supp. \nMot. J. Pleadings Resp. Opp’n Defs.’ Mot. J. Pleadings at 6  (“Citizens’ Reply”) , ECF \nNo. 88.   \nFor one thing, Citizens’ proposed commonalities do not even link the four listed \nstatutes.   The parallel Citizens attempts to draw between FCRA/FACTA and BIPA —\nthat each statute protects against the disclosure of personal information —does not \napply to the TCPA or the CAN -SPAM  Act, which do not regulate the collection or \n \n2  It bears mentioning that, while Krishna ’s substantive holding that the Statutory \nViolation exclusion is ambiguous is binding on this Court, its  application of ejusdem generis  \nis not.  See Cabeda v. At t’y Gen ., 971 F.3d 165, 171 n.4 (3d Cir. 2020) (“[S]hifting interpretive \nmethodologies are not usually viewed as carrying the force of stare decisis .”); Abbe R. Gluck, \nThe States as Laboratories of Statutory Interpretation: Methodological Consensus and the \nNew Modi fied Textualism , 119 YALE L.J. 1750, 1765 (2010) ( noting that “the [U.S. Supreme] \nCourt does not give stare decisis effect to any statements of statutory interpretation \nmethodology.  The interpretive rule used in one case  . . . is not viewed as ‘law’ for the next \ncase. ” (citation omitted)) .  And even if Krishna mandated applying ejusdem generis in the \ncontext of an exclusion containing only the TCPA and the CAN -SPAM Act, the exclusion in \nthe instant Policy is di stinguishable because it includes  FCRA and FACTA .  See Blount v. \nStroud , 904 N.E.2d 1, 15 (Ill. 2009) (“[T] he precedential scope of our decision is limited to the \nfacts that were before us .”). Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 10 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n dissemination of personal i nformation.  See generally 15 U.S.C. § 7701  et seq. ; 47 \nU.S.C. § 227  et seq.   And even if the Court were to entertain Citizens’ broader \nargument that all five statutes protect “privacy ” in a generalized sense, they still are \nnot sufficiently similar to justify reading  the exclusion’s catchall to cover  BIPA.  The \nTCPA and the CAN -SPAM  Act protect “privacy”  by regulating  unauthorized  \ncommunications  that private citizens receive  (e.g., telemarketing calls and spam \nemails) .  By contr ast, FCRA, FACTA, and BIPA protect “privacy” in a different sense , \nby regulating how private entities must handle private information that citizens give \naway  (e.g., credit card numbers and facial scans) .  This distinction tracks closely to \nthe different de finitions of “privacy,” a term that can mean both “freedom from \nunauthorized intrusion,” and “secrecy” or “a private matter.”   Privacy , MERRIAM -\nWEBSTER .COM, https://www.merriam -webster.com/dictionary/privacy  (last visited \nFeb. 26, 202 2); see Am. States Ins. Co. v. Cap. Assocs. of Jackson Cnty. , Inc., 392 F.3d \n939, 941 –43 (7th Cir. 200 4) (instructing lower courts to “ distinguish secrecy from \nseclusion, [and]  to appreciate that [drafters of statutes and insurance policies] may \nuse the word  ‘privacy ’ in different ways ”).  Because the type of “privacy” that BIPA \nprotects is dissimilar to the type of privacy that  the TCPA and the CAN -SPAM Act \nregulate,  ejusdem generis  does not do the work that Citizen s would have it do.  See \nAmerican  States , 392 F.3d at  941–43 (holding that an exclusion covering advertising \ninjury did not cover the TCPA because the TCPA protects “privacy” in the sense of \nseclusion, while adverti sing injury impinges on “privacy” in the sense of secrecy );  \nEvanston  Ins. Co. v. Gene by Gene, Ltd ., 155 F. Supp. 3d 706, 713 (S.D. Tex. 2016)  Case: 1:20-cv-03873 Document #: 111 Filed: 03/30/22 Page 11 of 14 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n (finding that  the TCPA and  the CAN -SPAM Act were not like statute regulating \ndisclosure of genetic information ). \nTo support its ejusdem generis argument, Citizens points to Massachusetts Bay \nInsurance Co. v. Impact Fulfillment Services, LLC , No. 1:20CV926, 2021 WL 4392061 \n(M.D.N.C. Sept. 24, 2021).3  That case applied ejusdem generis to hold that BIPA fell \nwithin a nearly identical exclusion,  which listed the  TCPA, the CAN -SPAM  Act, \nFCRA, and FACTA as specific examples followed by a catchall term.  See id. at *3 , 7.  \nBut the Massachusetts Bay court did not grapple with the distinction between the two \ntypes  of privacy  that are implicated in the enumerated statutes —privacy of personal \ninformation (as concerns FCRA and FACTA), versus  privacy from unwanted \ncommunications (as concern s the TCPA and the CAN -SPAM  Act).  In this way, \nMassachusetts Bay does not square with the  Seventh Circuit’s admonition in \nAmerican States  that a court  interpreting an insurance policy  must not “say . . . that \n[a statute] protects privacy,  and then stop the analysis ” without considering whether \nthe stat ute in question covers the same type of privacy interest as the policy is meant \nto cover .  392 F.3d at 942.  Thus, the Court respectfully disagrees with the holding in \nMassachusetts Bay .  \n \n3  Citizens cites numerous other cases holding that various other statutes fell within \nsimilar e xclusions because they protect privacy.  See OneBeacon Am. Ins. Co. v. Urb. \nOutfitters, Inc. , 21 F. Supp. 3d 426, 440 (E.D. Pa. 2014), aff’d, 625 F. App’x 177 (3d Cir. 2015); \nBig 5 Sporting Goods Corp. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co. , 957 F.

The Court \nfinds these cases unpersuasive , however, because they do not conside r this particular \nexclusion with reference to the distinction between “privacy” as seclusion and “privacy” as \nsecrec y.  See 21 F. Supp. 3d at 440; 957 F. Supp. 2d at 1150; 2017 WL 5557669, at *4 –5.

That rule provides  that “ a word is known by the company it keeps ,” or, in \nother words, an ambiguous term should be read to mean something similar to the \nwords that surround it.  Yates , 574 U.S. at 543.  The only discernible resemblance \nbetween the TCPA, the CAN -SPAM Act, FCRA, and FACTA is that they all protect \n“privac y.”  But once more, “privacy” in the BIPA context means something much \ndifferent than  “privacy” in the TCPA context , so the similarity is superficial at best .  \n“[W]ithout  a common feature to extrapolate”  onto the ambiguous term,  noscitur a \nsociis  “is no he lp.”  S.D.

Bd. of Envt’l Prot. , 547 U.S. 370, 379 –80 \n(2006). \nWith neither the plain text nor these canons of construction pointing to a clear \nmeaning, t he Court concludes that the Statutory Violation exclusion is intractably \nambiguous.  Thus, Citizens  has not met its burden to “affirmatively establish” that \nthe exclusion applies, much less that its application is “clear and free from doubt ,” as \nit must in order to rebut Wynndalco’s initial showing of coverage .

Aspen Specialty Ins. Co. , 19 F.4th 1002,  \n \n4  To the extent that Wynndalco seeks a declaratory judgment as to indemnification, \nthat request is denied as premature.  See Lear Corp. v. Johnson Elec. Holdings Ltd. , 353 F.3d \n580, 583 (7th Cir. 2003) (“[T]he determination of whether [defendant] has a duty to indemnify \nis not ripe until the underlying litigation is terminated.” (cleaned up)).

Moreover, because Citizens has a duty to defend Wynndalco \nwith respec t to the BIPA claims, it also has a duty to defend Wynndalco with respect \nto the common law claims in the Thornley Lawsuit.  See Mesa Lab’ys, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. \nCo., 994 F.3d 865, 868 (7th Cir. 2021) (under Illinois law, “ if even one claim is covered, \nthen the insurer has a duty to defend the entire suit ”). \nIV. Conclusion  \nFor the foregoing reasons, Wynndalco’s motion for judgment on the pleadings \nis granted, and Citizens’ motion for judgment on the pleadings is denied.  The Court \nholds that the Policy covers the Thornley  and Calderon  Lawsuits and that Citizens \nhas a duty to  defend Wynndalco and its officers, David Andalcio and Jose Flores, \nagainst the Thornley  and Calderon  Lawsuits.  \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court is providing preliminary approval for a class action settlement involving plaintiffs Joshua Lewis, Nathaniel Timmons, and James Cavanaugh against Lytx, Inc. The case involves claims related to privacy violations under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to the use of machine vision and artificial intelligence (MV+AI) to predict distracted driving behaviors using Lytx’s DriveCam. The court finds that the settlement, which includes a $4.25 million non-reversionary fund, appears fair and will likely be approved after a final hearing.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the use of Lytx’s MV+AI technology to predict distracted driving behaviors violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act by collecting and storing biometric data without consent from the vehicle operators.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court granted preliminary approval of the class action settlement, finding it likely to be fair, reasonable, and adequate. The court also certified the proposed settlement class and approved the settlement’s notice program.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: A group of people is suing a company because it used cameras with smart tech to watch drivers and spot when they got distracted. This might have broken rules about keeping people's private info safe. The company decided to settle, meaning they agreed to pay money to the drivers but didn't admit they did anything wrong. The judge thinks the deal looks okay for now and wants to check again to make sure it's really fair for everyone before giving the final thumbs up.",

(Doc. 122).  The Motion attaches and \nincorporates a Class Action Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement” or “Settlement \nAgreement”)  (Doc. 125)  that, together with the exhibits thereto, sets forth the terms and \nconditions for the settlement of claims, on a class wide  basis, between Plaintiffs Joshua \nLewis, Nathaniel Timmons, and James Cavanaugh (“Plaintiffs”) , individually and on \nbehalf of the Settlement Class , and Defendant Lytx, Inc. (“Lytx” or “Defendant” and, \nalong with Plaintiffs, the “Parties” ). \nHaving carefully considered the Motion, the Settlement Agreement together with \nall exhibits and attachments thereto, the record in this matter, and the briefs and \narguments of counsel,  as set forth below,  the Court finds that it likely will be able to \napprove the Settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate under Federal Rule of Civil Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 1 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 2 of 16 \n Procedure 23(e)(2). The Court likewise finds that it will likely be able to certify a class for \npurposes of judgment on the Settlement under Rules 23(a) and (b)(3), and that the \nproposed plan of notice (the “Notice Program”) to the Settlement Class is the best notice \npracticable under the circumstanc es and consistent with the requirements of due process \nand Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2) . Accordingly, a  hearing should and will be \nheld after notice to the Settlement Class to confirm that the Settle ment is fair, reasonable, \nand adequate, and to determine whether this Court should enter judgment approving the Settlement and an order of dismissal of this action based upon the Settlement. For \nthese reasons,  the Court  GRANTS the Motion and  ORDERS as follows:  \n1. Unless otherwise defined herein, all terms that are capitalized herein shall have \nthe same meaning ascribed to those terms in the Settlement Agreement.   \n2. The Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1332(d) and personal jurisdiction over the Parties and the members of \nthe Settlement Class.  \nPRELIMINARY APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT  \n4. The Court finds that, subject to the Final Approval Hearing, the Court will likely \nbe able to approve the Settlement as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best \ninterests of the Settlement Class.  \n5. The Court further finds that the Settlement substantially fulfills the purposes and objectives of the class action and provides beneficial relief to the Settlement Class, \nespecially considering the risks and delay of continued litigation.  \n6. The Court further finds that Plaintiffs and Class Counsel have adequately Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 2 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 3 of 16 \n represented, and will continue to adequately represent, the Class.  \n7. The Court further preliminarily finds that the Settlement is substantively fair. The \nCourt will assess Class Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees and expenses after \nreceiving a motion from Class Counsel supporting such request. At this stage, the \nCourt fi nds that the plan to request fees and litigation expenses creates no reason \nnot to grant the Motion and direct notice to the Class.  \n8. The Court preliminarily finds that the Settlement relief provided —a $4,250,000 \nnon- reversionary settlement fund (“Settlement Fund”) —is fair, reasonable, and \nadequate taking into account, inter alia , the costs, risks, and delay of further \nlitigation, trial and appeal, the alleged harm to the Class, the proposed method of \ndistributing payments to the Class and the absence of any agreement required to \nbe identified under Rule 23(e)(3).  \n9. The Court also finds that the Settlement Agreement: (a) is the result of arm’s -\nlength negotiations involving experienced counsel, with the assistance of a \nmediator; (b) is sufficient to warrant notice of the Settlement and the Final \nApproval Hearing to the  Settlement Class; (c) meets all applicable requirements of \nlaw, including Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 and the Class Action Fairness \nAct (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1715; and (d) is not a finding or admission of liability \nby Lytx.  \nCERTIFICATION OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS \n10. Under Rules 23(a) and (b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and solely for purposes of judgment on the proposed Settlement, the Court preliminarily Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 3 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 4 of 16 \n approves the following settlement class (“Settlement Class”):  \nAll individuals who, while present in the State of Illinois, operated a vehicle \nequipped with a Lytx DriveCam® Event Recorder (“DriveCam”), and for whom machine vision and artificial intelligence (“MV+AI”) was used to \npredict distracted driving behaviors b etween October 12, 2016, and the \nearlier of Preliminary Approval or January 1, 2025. \n \n11. Excluded from the Settlement Class are (1) any Judge or Magistrate  Judge  \npresiding over this Action and members of their families; (2) Defendant, its \nsubsidiaries, parent companies, successors, predecessors, and any entity in which \nDefendant or its parents have a controlling interest and their current or former \nofficers, direc tors, agents, and attorneys; (3) persons who properly execute and file \na timely request for exclusion from the Settlement Class; and (4) the legal \nrepresentatives, successors or assign s of any such excluded persons.  \n12. All Persons who are members of the Settlement Class who have not submitted a \ntimely request for exclusion are referred to collectively as “Settlement Class \nMembers” or individually as a “Settlement Class Member.”  \n13. For purposes of settlement only, the Court finds that it will likely be able to certify \nthe Settlement Class under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3), as the \nprerequisites thereunder appear to be  met, including (1) that the Settlement Class \nis sufficiently  numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) that there \nare questions of law and fact common to members of the Settlement Class that \npredominate over questions affecting only individual members (e.g., whether Lytx \ncollected an d stored Settlement Class Members’ biometric data, without consent, \nthrough dash cam devices in a manner that violated BIPA, and whether Plaintiffs Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 4 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 5 of 16 \n and the Settlement Class Members are entitled to uniform statutory damages \nunder BIPA); (3) that Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the Settlement \nClass; (4) that Plaintiffs and Class Counsel will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of  the Settlement Class; and (5) that a settlement class action is a superior \nmethod of fairly and efficiently adjudicating this Action.  \n14. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, and for settlement purposes only. \nPlaintiffs Joshua Lewis, James Cavanaugh, and Nathaniel Timmons are hereby \nappointed Class Representatives,  and the following are hereby appointed as Class \nCounsel:  Carney Bates & Pulliam PLLC; Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP; \nMilberg Coleman Bryson Phillips Grossman PLLC; Workplace Partners, P.C.; \nWerman Salas P.C.; and Nick Larry Law LLC. \n15. The Court finds that the above attorneys are competent and capable of exercising \nthe responsibilities of Class Counsel and that Plaintiffs will adequately protect the \ninterests of the Settlement Class defined above.  \n16. Certification of the Settlement Class shall be solely for settlement purposes and \nwithout prejudice to the Parties in the event the Settlement is not finally approved \nby this Court or otherwise does not take effect. The Parties preserve all rights and \ndefe nses regarding class certification in the event the Settlement is not finally \napproved by this Court or otherwise does not take effect.  \nNOTICE AND ADMINISTRATION \n17. The Court directs the Settlement Administrator to perform the functions and \nduties set forth in the Settlement Agreement and to provide such other Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 5 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 6 of 16 \n administration services as are reasonably necessary to facilitate the completion of \nthe Settlement.  \n18. The Court has carefully considered the forms and methods of notice to the Settlement Class set forth in the Settlement (“Notice Program”). The Court finds \nthat the Notice Program is reasonably calculated to apprise members of the \nSettlement Class of the pendency of this action, the terms of the Settlement, and \nthe right to object to the Settlement and to exclude themselves from the Settlement \nClass. The Court finds that the Notice Program constitutes the best notice \npracticable under the circumstances and f ully satisfies the requirements of  Rule 23 \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the requirements of due process, and the \nrequirements of any other applicable law, such that the terms of the Settlement, \nthe releases provided for therein, and this Court’s final judgment will be binding \non all Settlement Class Members. The Court further finds that the Notice Program \nconstitutes valid, due, and sufficient notice to all persons entitled thereto, and \nmeets the requirements of due process. Accordingly, the Cou rt finds that no notice \nother than that specifically identified in the Settlement Agreement is necessary.  \n19. The Court hereby approves the Notice Program and the form, content, and requirements of the Postcard Notice attached as Exhibit C to the Settlement \nAgreement, the Email Notice attached as Exhibit B to the Settlement Agreement, \nand the Long Form Notice atta ched as Exhibit D to the Settlement Agreement (the \n“Notices”), and the Claim Form attached as Exhibit E to the Settlement Agreement (the “Claim Form”).  Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 6 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 7 of 16 \n 20.  The Court finds that the Notices clearly and concisely state in plain, easily \nunderstood language, inter alia : (a) the nature of the case; (b) the definition of the \nSettlement Class; (c) the class claims and issues; (d) that the Court will exclude from the Settlement Class any Settlement Class member who timely and validly \nrequests exclusion; (e) the time and man ner for requesting such exclusion; and \n(f) the binding effect of a class judgment on Settlement Class members under Rule \n23(c)(3). The Parties, by  agreement, may revise the Notices and Claim Form in \nways that are not material, or in ways that are appropriate to update those \ndocuments for purposes of accuracy or formatting, consistent with this Order.  \n21. In compliance with the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, 28 U.S.C. § 1715, \nDefendant shall promptly provide written notice of the proposed Settlement to the \nappropriate authorities.  \n22. The Settlement Administrator shall cause the Notice Program to be executed \nwithin 70 days  following the entry of this Order (the “Notice Date”). Class \nCounsel, prior to the Final Approval Hearing, shall file with the Court a declaration executed by the Settlement Administrator attesting to the timely \ncompletion of the Notice Program.  \n23. No later than the Notice Date, the Settlement Administrator shall maintain the \nSettlement Website to provide full information about the Settlement and allow for \nthe filing of claims online.  \n24. No later than 16 days  prior to the Final Approval Hearing, the Settlement \nAdministrator shall serve on counsel for all Parties a declaration stating that the Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 7 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 8 of 16 \n Notice required by the Agreement has been completed in accordance with the \nterms of the Preliminary Approval Order, and that the CAFA Notice was served. \nThe Settlement Administrator shall likewise provide Defendant and Class Counsel \nwith a final list of pe rsons who submitted timely and valid requests for exclusion \nfrom the Settlement Class.  \nSUBMISSION OF CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR EXCLUSIONS \n25. Settlement Class Members who wish to receive benefits under the Settlement must \ncomplete and submit a timely and valid Claim Form in accordance with the \ninstructions contained therein. To be timely, Claim Forms must be postmarked or \nreceived by the Settlement Administrator by  June  25, 20 25. Settlement Class \nMembers who do not submit a claim and those who do not submit a timely and \nvalid claim will not receive a payment under the Settlement, but they will be \nbound by the Settlement.  \n26. The Settlement Administrator shall review all claims to determine their validity \nand shall employ reasonable procedures to screen claims for abuse and fraud, and \ndeny claims where there is evidence of abuse or fraud. The Settlement \nAdministrator may reject any claim that is not submitted by a Settlement Class \nMember; that does not comply in any material respect with the instructions on the \nClaim Form; or that is submitted after the Claims Deadline.  \n27. As set forth in the Settlement Agreement, each claimant who submits an invalid \nClaim Form to the Settlement Administrator must be given a notice of the Claim \nForm’s deficiency and an opportunity to cure the deficiency within 21 days  of the Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 8 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 9 of 16 \n date of the notice. The Settlement Administrator may contact any Person who has \nsubmitted a Claim Form to obtain additional information necessary to verify the \nClaim Form. Each and every member of the Settlement Class who does not timely \nand validly submit  a claim shall be forever barred from participating in any \ndistributions of the Settlement Fund, and shall be bound by all determinations and orders pertaining to the Settlement, including the release of all claims to the extent \nset forth in the Settlement, unless such person requests exclusion from the \nSettlement in a timely and proper manner, as hereinafter provided.  \n28. A member of the Settlement Class wishing to request exclusion (or “opt- out”) from \nthe Settlement shall mail a request for exclusion to the Settlement Administrator. \nThe request for exclusion must be in writing, must be mailed to the Settlement \nAdministrato r at the address specified in the Notice, must be postmarked no later \nthan 60 days  following the Notice Date (“Opt- Out Deadline”), must include \n(a) his/her full name, address, and current telephone number; (b) the entity or \nentities for whom they drove and  when; (c) all grounds for the request to be \nexcluded, with factual and legal support for the stated request, including any \nsupporting materials; (d) the identification of any other exclusion requests he/she \nhas filed, or has had filed on his/her behalf, i n any other class action cases in the \nlast five years; and (e) the requestor’s signature. The request for exclusion shall not be effective unless it provides the required information and is made within the \ntime stated above. No member of the Settlement Cla ss, or any person acting on \nbehalf of or in concert or in participation with a member of the Settlement Class, Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 9 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 10 of 16 \n may request exclusion of any other member of the Settlement Class from the \nSettlement.  \n29. Members of the Settlement Class who timely request exclusion from the Settlement will relinquish their rights to benefits under the Settlement and will not \nrelease any claims against Lytx.  \n30. All members of the Settlement Class who do not timely and validly request \nexclusion shall be bound by all terms of the Settlement Agreement and by the Final \nApproval Order and Judgment even if they have previously initiated or \nsubsequently initiate individual litigation or any other proceedings against Lytx.  \n31. The Settlement Administrator shall promptly provide all Parties with copies of any exclusion requests, and Plaintiffs shall file a list of all persons who have validly \nopted out of the Settlement with the Court prior to the Final Approval Hearing.  \nAPPEARANCES AND OBJECTIONS  \n32. Any member of the Settlement Class who does not file a timely request for \nexclusion, but who wishes to object to approval of the proposed Settlement, to the \naward of attorneys’ fees and costs, or to the Service Awards to the Class \nRepresentatives must file  with the Court a written statement (along with any \nsupporting papers), postmarked or filed on or before 60 days  following the Notice \nDate (“Objection Deadline”), that includes a caption or title that identifies it as \n“Objection to Class Settlement in Lewi s, et al. v.

A Settlement Class Member who has timely filed a written objection stating the \nSettlement Class Member’s intention to appear at the Final Approval Hearing as \nset forth above may appear at the Final Approval Hearing in person or through \ncounsel to be heard orally regarding his or her objection. It is not necessary, \nhowever, for a Settlement Class Member who has filed a timely objection to appear \nat the Final Approval Hearing. No Settlement Class Member wishing to be heard Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 11 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 12 of 16 \n orally in opposition to the approval of the Settlement and/or the request for \nattorneys’ fees and costs and/or the request for a Service Award to each of the \nClass Representatives will be heard unless that Settlement Class Member has filed \na timely written  objection as set forth above, including a statement that the \nSettlement Class Member intends to appear at the Final Approval Hearing.  \n34. Any Settlement Class Member who does not make an objection to the Settlement \nin the manner provided herein shall be deemed to have waived and forfeited any \nand all rights he or she may have to object, appear, present witness testimony, \nand/or submit eviden ce; shall be barred from appearing, speaking, or introducing \nany testimony or evidence at the Final Approval Hearing; shall be precluded from seeking review of the Settlement by appeal or other means; and shall be bound by \nall terms of the Settlement and b y all proceedings, orders, and judgments in the \nAction.  \n35. Any challenge to the Settlement Agreement or the Final Approval Order and \nJudgment shall be pursuant to appeal under the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure and not through a collateral attack.  \nFINAL APPROVAL HEARING  \n37. The Final Approval Hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) will \nbe held before this Court on July 24 , 2025,  at 1:30 p.m. for the following purposes: \n(i) to finally determine whether the applicable prerequisites for settlement class \naction treatment under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3) are met; \n(ii) to determine whether the Settlement is fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 12 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 13 of 16 \n best interests of the Class, and should be given final approval by the Court; (iii) to \ndetermine whether the judgment as provided under the Settlement Agreement \nshould be entered, dismissing this Action with prejudice and releasing all Released \nClaims; (iv ) to consider the application for an award of attorneys’ fees and \nexpenses of Class Counsel; (v) to consider the application for a Service Award to each of the Class Representatives; (vi) to consider the distribution of the Settlement \nbenefits under the terms of the Settlement Agreement; and (vii) to rule upon such \nother matters as the Court may deem appropriate.  \n38. On or before 21 days  after the Notice Date, Class Counsel shall file any application \nfor attorneys’ fees and expenses and Service Awards to the Class Representatives \n(the “Fee Petition”).  \n39. No later than 14 days  prior to the Final Approval Hearing, Plaintiffs shall file \npapers in support of final approval of the settlement.  \n40. The Final Approval Hearing may be postponed, adjourned, transferred, or continued by order of the Court without further notice to the Settlement Class. At \nor following the Final Approval Hearing, the Court may enter a Final Approval \nOrder and Judgment in a ccordance with the Settlement Agreement that will \nadjudicate the rights of all class members.  \n41. For clarity, the deadlines the Parties and members of the Settlement Class shall \nadhere to are as follows:  \n  Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 13 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 14 of 16 \n EVENT  DATE  \nNotice Date  March 2 8, 2025  \nClass Counsel’s Fee and Cost \nApplication  April 1 8, 202 5 \nClaims Deadline  June 25, 2025  \nObjection/Opt -Out Deadline  May 2 8, 2025  \nPlaintiff’s Motion for Final Approval  July 10, 2025  \nFinal Approval Hearing  July 24, 2025  \n \n42. Settlement Class Members do not need to appear at the Final Approval Hearing \nor take any other action to indicate their approval.  \nFURTHER MATTERS  \n43. To facilitate the Settlement, Plaintiffs are GRANTED leave to file an Amended \nClass Action Complaint solely for the purpose of adding  Plaintiffs Cavanaugh and \nTimmons.  \n44. All discovery and other pretrial proceedings in the Action as between Plaintiffs and Lytx are stayed and suspended until further order of the Court except such \nactions as may be necessary to implement the Settlement and this Order.  \n45. The Settlement does not constitute an admission, concession, or indication by the Parties of the validity of any claims or defenses in the Action or of any liability, \nfault, or wrongdoing of any kind by Lytx, which vigorously denies all of the claims \nand a llegations raised in the Action.  \n46. In the event that the Settlement is terminated under the terms of the Settlement, or if for any reason whatsoever the approval of it does not become final and no longer \nsubject to appeal, then: (i) the Settlement shall be null and void, including any Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 126     Filed 01/17/25     Page 14 of 16     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 15 of 16 \n provisions related to the award of attorneys’ fees and costs, shall have no further \nforce and effect with respect to any party in this Action, and may not be referred \nto or used as evidence or for any other purpose whatsoever in the Action or any \nother action or proceeding; (ii) all negotiations, proceedings, documents prepared, \nand statements made in connection therewith shall be without prejudice to any \nperson or party hereto, shall not be deemed or construed to be an admission by \nany party of any act, ma tter, or proposition, and shall not be used in any manner \nof or for any purpose in any subsequent proceeding in this Action, provided, however, that the termination of the Settlement shall not shield from subsequent \ndiscovery any factual information provided in connection with the negotiation of \nthis Settlement that would ordinarily be discoverable but for the attempted \nsettlement; (iii) this Order shall be vacated and of no further force or effect \nwhatsoever, as if it had never been entered; and ( iv) any p arty may elect to move \nthe Court to implement the provisions of this paragraph, and none of the non -\nmoving parties (or their counsel) shall oppose any such motion.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In a class action against Arlo Technologies, Inc., the plaintiffs, delivery drivers in Illinois, allege that Arlo's home security systems violate the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by capturing and storing biometric data without informed consent or a public data retention policy. The court denied Arlo's motions to dismiss these claims and to strike supplemental authority, finding the allegations sufficient to establish standing and plausible claims under BIPA. This case involves AI as it pertains to Arlo's use of facial recognition and other AI-powered features to capture biometric data.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Arlo Technologies' capture and use of biometric data from its security systems without proper consent, collection, and retention policies violates BIPA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Arlo's motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Arlo's actions were subject to BIPA, thus allowing their claims to proceed. The court also found that plaintiffs had Article III standing.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Some delivery drivers are upset because they believe a company called Arlo is using its fancy security cameras to secretly capture and store information about their faces and bodies without asking permission. They say that Arlo is being sneaky because they don’t have a clear plan about how long they will keep this info or how they will eventually get rid of it. The court said, \"We’re not throwing this case out just yet,\" which means they'll get to find out if Arlo really did anything wrong.",

BACKGROUND  \nA. Factual Allegations  \n1. Parties  \nPlaintiffs Tibbs, Castillo, and Wilim are Illinois residents.  FAC ¶¶ 14 –16.  Plaintiffs work Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 1 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT. DISMISS FAC; MOT. STRIKE NOT. SUPPL.

Id. \nArlo is a Delaware c orporation with a principal place of business in Milpitas, California.  \nId. ¶ 17.  Arlo is a home security company that offers security cameras supported by high quality \nvideo and artificial intelligence (“AI”) monitoring.  Id. \n2. Arlo’s Home Security System  \nPlaintiffs allege that every time an  Illinois delivery driver make s a food, mail, or package \ndelivery to a home that is equipped with Arlo’s home security system, Arlo’s security cameras \ncapture geometric scans of the driver’s face, body, and hands in both  the infrared and visible light \nspectra.  FAC ¶ 2.  The cameras can collect videos in the visible light spectrum in various high \nresolutions, including 1080p, 2K, HD, and 4K; some have color night vision as well.  Id. ¶ 26.  \nFurther, most Arlo devices dete ct motion using passive infrared (“PIR”) technology, which detects \nobjects that are warmer than the surrounding environment.  Id.  Arlo’s infrared facial recognition \ntechnology is even capable of distinguishing between individuals wearing glasses, whereas many \nother types of facial recognition technology struggle to identify individuals wearing sunglasses or \nbalaclavas.  Id. ¶ 4.  The combination and analysis of the scans in two spectra —infrared radiation \nand visible light —allows Arlo to identify particular individuals.  See id.  ¶ 27.  \nArlo’s home security systems do not include the full capabilities of its recognition \nsoftware, and it does not provide homeowners with software that can process the  camera scans to \nrecognize unique individuals.  FAC  ¶ 6.  However, Arlo does sell a “Person Detection” feature as \npart of its home security offerings.  See id.  ¶ 5.  The Person Detection feat ure uses artificial \nintelligence (“AI”) technology and uses advanced algorithms to analyze the infrared and visible \nlight scans collected by Arlo’s cameras to: (1) distinguish between humans and animals; (2) filter \nout everyday movement (such as tree branc hes) and provide real -time alerts to the homeowner \nwhen a person is detected approaching the home; and (3) allow the homeowner to search the \ncamera video feeds for videos containing people.  See id.  ¶¶ 5, 24.   \nIn addition to the Person Detection feature, Arlo sells homeowners  the following features : Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 2 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

Homeowners may activate or deactivate these features by toggling a motion alert setting \nfor each category in the Arlo app.  Id. \nPlaintiffs allege that the scans that Arlo can use to identify unique individuals are \nbiometric identifie rs, and Arlo’s AI needs to collect, use, and  store such biometric identifiers  to \naccomplish its various person detection tasks.  See id.  ¶¶ 2, 5, 26.  In particular, Plaintiffs allege \nthat the Person Detection feature necessarily requires the collection of  people’s facial, body, and \nhand geometry  in both the infrared and visible light spectra to reliably  distinguish people from \nanimals.   See i d. ¶ 5, 26.  \nArlo did not inform Plaintiffs that it was collecting biometric identifiers, or of the purpose \nand length of time for which their biometric identifiers would be collected, stored, and  used.  See \nFAC ¶ 43.  Further, Arlo did not publish public access policies identifying its retention schedules \nor guidelines for permanently destroying  any of these biomet ric identifiers.   Id. ¶ 44.  \n3. Arlo’s Presence in Market  \nArlo is one of the largest players in the home security market in the United States.  FAC ¶ \n21.  According to its most recent investor report, Arlo generated $490 million in revenue in 2022 \nand had a pa rticularly strong 53% year -over-year growth in the last quarter of 2022.  Id.  \n4. Class Allegations  \nPlaintiffs allege a putative class defined as:  “All natural persons in Illinois who are \ndelivery drivers and who, when making deliveries, had their biometric identifiers collected, stored, \nand scanned by Arlo cameras and software from October 4, 2018, to present.”  Id. ¶ 45.  \nB. Procedural History  \n Plaintiffs initiated this action on October 4, 2023.  See Compl., ECF No. 1.  Arlo filed a Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 3 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT. DISMISS FAC; MOT. STRIKE NOT. SUPPL.

The \nFAC asserts two claims:  (1) violation of 740 ILCS 14/15(b)  and (2) violation of 740 ILCS \n14/15(a).  See FAC ¶¶ 52 –75. \nArlo filed the instant Motion to Dismiss on January 26, 2024 , pursuant  to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) .  See Mot.  The Motion to Dismiss was fully briefed on \nFebruary 14, 2024.  See Opp’n, ECF No. 32; Reply, No. 33.  The hearing was set for March 28, \n2024, and Court took the Motion to Dismiss under submission without oral argument on March \n22, 2024.  See ECF No. 43.  \nOn April 30, 2024, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority.  See ECF No. 44.  \nOn May 3, 2024, Arlo filed the instant Motion to Strike.  See Strike Mot.  Plaintiffs filed an \nopposition to the Motion to Strike on May 6, 2024.  See Strike Opp’n, ECF No. 47.  Additionally, \nArlo filed a Statement of Recent Decision on May 3, 2024, see ECF No. 46, and Plaintiffs filed a \nNotice of Supplemental Authority on June 17, 2024, see ECF No. 4 8. \nII. LEGAL STANDARDS  \nA. Motion to Dismiss  FAC  \n1. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)  \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) permits a defendant to challenge the existence of \nthe Court’s subject matter jurisdiction over the action.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  “Federal \ncourts are courts of limited jurisdiction  . . .  possess [ing]  only that power authorized by \nConstitution and statute.”  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am. , 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).   \nArticle III of the United States Constitution “ limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to ‘Cases ’ and \n‘Controversies .’”  Lujan v. D efenders of Wildlife , 504 U.S. 555, 559 (1992).  The party invoking \nfederal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing that  the plaintiff has standing to bring the suit, \ni.e., that  the action is a case or controversy “ of the justiciable sort referred to  in Article III .”  Id. at \n560–61.  “[T]he irreducible constitutional minimum of standing contains three elements .”  Id. at \n560.  “ The plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the \nchallenged conduct of the defendan t, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 4 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

Robins , 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016) (citations omitted).  “[A] t the \npleading stage, the plaintiff must ‘clearly . . . allege facts demonstrating ’ each element. ”  Id. \n(quoting Warth v. Seldin , 442 U.S. 490, 518 (1975)).  \n2. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6)  \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must dismiss a complaint if it fails \nto state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  To survive a Rul e 12(b)(6) motion, a plaintiff \nmust allege “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Bell Atl. Corp. v. \nTwombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007).  A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads facts \npermitting the court t o “draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citation omitted).  The \nallegations must show “more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.”  Id.  \nMere “conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences are insufficient to defeat a \nmotion to dismiss.”  Adams v. Johnson , 355 F.3d 1179, 1183 (9th Cir. 2004).  \nWhen determining whether a claim has been stated, a district court's review is limited to \nthe face of the complaint and judicially noticeable information.  MGIC Indem. Corp. v. Weisman , \n803 F.2d 500, 504 (9th Cir. 1986); N. Star Int'l v. Ariz. Corp. Comm’n , 720 F.2d 578, 581 (9th \nCir. 1983).  The court must accept as true all well -pleaded factual allegations and construe them in \nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff.  Reese v. BP Expl. (Alaska) Inc. , 643 F.3d 681, 690 (9th \nCir. 2011).  The Court need no t, however, “assume the truth of legal conclusions merely because \nthey are cast in the form of factual allegations.”  Fayer v. Vaughn , 649 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. \n2011) (per curiam).  \nB. Motion to Strike Notice of Supplemental Authority  \nA district court may in its discretion strike a filing for failure to comply with the local \nrules.  See Christian v. Mattel, Inc. , 286 F.3d 1118, 1129 (9th Cir. 2002) ( “The district court has \nconsiderable latitude in managing the parties' motion practice and enforcing local ru les that place \nparameters on briefing. ”); see also, e.g. , Hudson v. Wells Fargo & Co. , No. 21 -cv-08296 , 2022 \nWL 2716526 , at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 13, 2022) (“ While Plaintiff clearly exceeded the page limit in Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 5 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

DISCUSSION  \nBecause Defendant’s Motion to Strike concerns a Notice of Supplemental Authority \nPlaintiffs filed in support of their opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, the Court \naddresses the Motion to Str ike first.  \nA. Motion to Strike  \nDefendant moves the Court to strike Plaintiffs’ Notice of Supplemental Authority , see ECF \nNo. 44,  filed on April 30, 2024.  See Strike Mot. 1.  Defendant argues that the filing violate s Civil \nLocal Rule 7 -3(d) because it include s about 1.5 pages of argument regarding the supplemental \nauthority at issue, and requests that the Court either (1) “deny Plaintiffs’ request that the \nimproperly submitted supplemental authority be considered in ruling on Arlo’s pending Motion to \nDismiss” or (2) grant Defendant leave to file a proposed 1.5 -page response to the argument set \nforth in Plaintiffs’ filing.  See id.   Plaintiffs counter that  (1) the Notice does not contain argument, \nbut instead directly quote s the new authority, and (2) even if the Court consider s the filing to \ncontain argument, the sum total of Plaintiffs’ opposition papers to the Motion to Dismiss would be \n18 pages and thus well below the 25 -page limit for opposition briefs.  See Strike Opp’n 1.  \nThe Court finds that Pl aintiffs’ April 30, 2024 Notice of Supplemental Authority violates \nthis district’s local rules, which require a party to provide no more than a citation and copy of the \ndecision at issue.  See Civil L.R. 7 -3(d)(2).  However, the  Court has not reviewed and will not \nreview the text of Plaintiff’s filing.  The  Court will in its discretion consider Plaintiffs to have filed \na compliant statement of recent decision, and will consider only the copy of the decision attached Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 6 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

The Court therefo re DENIES  Defendant’s request that the Court refuse to \nconsider the supplemental authority.1  Further, because the Court is not considering Plaintiff’s \nadditional text, it also DENIES  Defendant’s request for leave to file a proposed response.  \nB. Motion to Di smiss  \nPlaintiffs assert BIPA claims for violations of 740 ILCS 14/15(b) ( “Claim 1 ” or “Section \n15(b)” ) and 740 ILCS 14/15(a) ( “Claim 2 ” or “Section 15(a)” ).  See FAC ¶¶ 52 –75.  Sections \n15(a) and (b) of BIPA provide:  \n \n(a) A private entity in possession of biom etric identifiers or biometric \ninformation must develop a written policy, made available to the \npublic, establishing a retention schedule and guidelines for \npermanently destroying biometric identifiers and biometric \ninformation when the initial purpose for  collecting or obtaining \nsuch identifiers or information has been satisfied or within 3 years \nof the individual's last interaction with the private entity, \nwhichever occurs first. Absent a valid warrant or subpoena issued \nby a court of competent jurisdicti on, a private entity in possession \nof biometric identifiers or biometric information must comply \nwith its established retention schedule and destruction guidelines.  \n \n(b) No private entity may collect, capture, purchase, receive through \ntrade, or otherwise obta in a person's or a customer's biometric \nidentifier or biometric information, unless it first:  \n \n(1) informs the subject or the subject's legally authorized \nrepresentative in writing that a biometric identifier or \nbiometric information is being collected or stored;  \n \n(2) informs the subject or the subject's legally authorized \nrepresentative in writing of the specific purpose and length of \nterm for which a biometric identifier or biometric information \nis being collected, stored, and used; and  \n \n(3) receives  a written release executed by the subject of the \nbiometric identifier or biometric information or the subject's \nlegally authorized representative.  \n \n740 ILCS 14/15(a).  \nArlo moves to dismiss both counts of the FAC on the grounds that (1) Plaintiffs lack \nArticle III standing for Claim 2 and therefore cannot invoke federal jurisdiction over the claim, \n \n1 The Court notes that both Defendant and Plaintiffs subsequently filed further statements of \nrecent decisions.  See ECF Nos. 46, 48.  Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 7 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT. DISMISS FAC; MOT. STRIKE NOT. SUPPL.

See generally \nMot.  The Court addresses these arguments in turn.  \n1. Standing  \nPlaintiffs have the burden to establish Article III standing by sufficiently alleging that they \nhave  “(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the \ndefendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo , 578 \nU.S. at 338 (citations omitted) .  The injury in fact element req uires Plaintiffs to allege “ an invasion \nof a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized; and (b) actual or imminent, \nnot conjectural or hypothetical .”  Patel v. Facebook, Inc. , 932 F.3d 1264, 1270 (9th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Lujan , 504 U.S. at 560).   Defendant argues that Plaintiffs fail to establish  an injury in fact  \nbecause they have not alleged a concrete and particularized injury .  See Mot. 6 –7; Reply 12 –13. \nThe Ninth Circuit has “adopted a two -step approach to determine whether th e violation of \na statute causes a concrete injury.”  Patel , 932 F.3d at  1270.  Under this approach, courts should \n“ask ‘(1) whether the statutory provisions at issue were established to protect the plaintiff ’s \nconcrete interests (as opposed to purely proce dural rights), and if so, (2) whether the specific \nprocedural violations alleged in this case actually harm, or present a material risk of harm to, such \ninterests.”   Id. at 1270 –71 (quoting Robins v. Spokeo, Inc. , 867 F.3d 1108, 1113 ( 9th Cir. 2017)) \n(internal brackets omitted).  \nIn Patel , the Ninth Circuit applied the two -step approach to determine whether plaintiffs \nhad standing to bring BIPA claims against Facebook for alleged violations of Section s 15(a) and \n(b), i.e., the same statutes at issue in this  action.  See id.  at 1268 (“ According to the complaint, \nFacebook violated sections 15(a) and 15(b) of BIPA by collecting, using, and storing biometric \nidentifiers (a ‘scan’ of ‘face geometry, ’ []) from their photos without obtaining a written release \nand w ithout establishing a compliant retention schedule. ”) (internal citation omitted).

The Ninth Circuit \nconclude d that the Patel  plaintiffs’ allegations that Facebook’s violations of the BIPA \nrequirements allowed it to create, use, and retain individuals’ face templates “necessarily \nviolate[d] the plaintiffs’ substantive privacy interests,” so that the plaintiffs ha d alleged a concrete \nand particularized harm sufficient to establish the injury -in-fact element for Article III standing  for \nthe alleged violations of Sections 15(a) and (b) .  See id.  at 1274 –75. \nThe Ninth Circuit recently clarified that  although BIPA esta blishes concrete interests in \nprivacy,  the mere failure to “ provide a retention schedule or guidelines for permanently destroying \nthe biometric identifiers and/or biometric information ” is not sufficient to state an injury to a \nparticular person, as oppose d to the public generally.  See Zellmer v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , --- \nF.4th ----, 2024 WL 3016946, at *8 (9th Cir. June 17, 2024) (citing Bryant v. Compass Grp. USA, \nInc., 958 F.3d 617, 626 (7th Cir. 2020); Fox v.

These allegations , along with the Court’s conclusion that Plaintiffs have \nsufficiently stated a vi olation of Section 15(b), see infra , at Part III(B)(2), are sufficient to state a \ntheory of concrete and particularized harm in violation of Section 15(a): namely, that Arlo has \ncollected, used, and stored Plaintiffs’ biometric information without the prop er procedures —a \nretention policy and compliance therewith —to safeguard Plaintiffs’ substantive privacy interests.  \nSee Patel , 932 F.3d at 1274 –75; Zellmer , 2024 WL 3016946 , at *8.  \n2. Sufficiency of Allegations to State a Claim  \nArlo next argues that both of Pl aintiffs’ claims must be dismissed for failure to state a \nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6).   See Mot. 7 –23.  Arlo first argues that that both BIPA claims fail for \ntwo common reasons:  (1) Plaintiffs do not allege facts suggesting that they were recorded by an \nArlo camera equipped with the relevant detection features; and (2) Plaintiffs do not sufficiently \nallege that Arlo collected biometric identifiers.  See Mot. 8 –17.  Arlo then argues that the Section \n15(b) claim fails because the statute does not apply to the conduct at issue here, see id.  at 17 –21, \nand that the Section 15(a) claim fails because Arlo is in compliance with the statute and because \nArlo does not “possess” Plaintiffs’ biometric data under the meaning of the statute, see id.  at 21 –\n23.  The Court addresses these arguments in turn.  \na. Recordings by Arlo Cameras  \nDefendant argues that the FAC does not plausibly allege that Plaintiffs made deliveries to \nany home in Illinois at which an Arlo camera was installed with the necessary features to capture \nthe scans at issue in this action.  See Mot. 8 –10; see also  Reply 2  (arguing Plaintiffs’ claims are \npremised on “pure speculation” that they have been captured by Arlo cameras in Illinois) .  \nPlaintiffs respond that these arguments raise factual questions not appropriate for resolution on a \nmotion to dismiss.  See Opp’n 4 –6. \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs.  The FAC  acknowledges that Plaintiffs are “unable to \ndetermine which houses have such surveillance[] systems in place,” FAC ¶ 56, but  alleges that Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 10 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

BIPA provides that “‘ [b]iometric \nidentifier ’ means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand or face geometry ,” \nand goes on to list various items, such as tattoos or human biological samples used for scientific \ntesting, that are not “biometric identifiers” covered by  BIPA.   Id. at 14/10.  “‘ Biometric \ninformation ’ means any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, \nbased on an individual's biometric identifier used to identify an individual. ”  Id.   \nArlo argues that the FAC does not s tate a claim under BIPA because Plaintiffs do not \nallege that Arlo’s infrared or visible light scans (1) can be used by Arlo to identify Plaintiffs, see \nMot. 14 –17, and (2) fall into the definition of “ a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or sca n \nof hand or face geometry ,” but rather that Arlo’s scans are “heat maps,” which are not included in \nBIPA’s enumerated list of biometric identifiers,  see id. at 17.  Plaintiffs counter that the FAC \nplausibly alleges that Arlo collects biometric identifiers  by capturing geometric scans of an \nindividual’s face and hands , which can be used to identify Plaintiffs .  See Opp’n 6 –11. \nAddressing the second argument first, Plaintiffs allege that the scans taken by Arlo’s \ncameras capture infrared and visible light da ta that Arlo’s technology then uses to “map[] pe oples’ \nfacial geometry.”  FAC ¶ 31; see also, e.g. , id. ¶ 2 (“Defendant’s security cameras capture \ngeometric scans of Plaintiffs and other Illinois delivery drivers’ faces, bodies, and hands.”).  \nTaking these  allegations as true, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged the necessary —\nalthough not sufficient —fact that Arlo captures data included on BIPA’s list of biometric \nidentifiers, namely, “scan[s] of hand or face geometry.”  \nIn addition to alleging data  included on the BIPA list, the Ninth Circuit has clarified that \nboth biometric identifiers and biometric information must be capable of identifying an individual \nto be regulated by BIPA.  See Zellmer , 2024 WL 3016946, at *4.

In Zellmer , the Ninth Circuit held on review of summary judgment that a “face \nsignature” that did not reveal any geometric information abou t a face or correspond to facial \nfeatures —and instead was an abstract, numerical representation that could not be reverse -\nengineered to display a face —was not a biometric identifier.  See id.  at *6.  By contrast, Plaintiffs \nhere allege that “Arlo’s patents confirm that these . . . scans . . . can be used to identify particular \nindividuals.”  FAC ¶ 6; see also id.  ¶ 32 (“Arlo boasts that ‘the invention provides a new and \nuseful facial recognition system  that may further automatically execute tasks in response to the \ndetection of a particular individual.’”).  \nDefendant argues that Plaintiffs must allege that Arlo itself is capable of using the scans to \ndetermine Plaintiffs’ identities —e.g., their names, ph one numbers, email addresses —and that the \nFAC instead alleges an implausible hypothetical situation in which Arlo could use its facial \nrecognition technology to match Plaintiffs’ faces to their photos on public facing social media \nprofiles.  See Mot. 16; F AC ¶¶ 64 –65.4  But these are not Plaintiffs’ only allegations regarding \nArlo’s capacity to identify individuals using its scans.  Plaintiffs allege that Arlo has explained in a \nEuropean patent  that its face recognition technology can identify a specific p erson at a door and \nsend a user a message such as “Mary detected at front door” or, conversely, inform a user of \n“Unknown person at front door.”  FAC ¶ ¶ 28, 32.  Arlo argues that the European patent is not \nrelevant here, but the Court takes as true Plainti ffs’ allegation that the same scans are used in \nArlo’s home security cameras .  See id.  ¶ 27.  Plaintiffs further allege that “Defendant’s cameras \ncollected Plaintiffs’ face geometry and stored the image of Plaintiffs’ face geometry in an \nelectronic databas e” whenever Plaintiffs made deliveries to homes equipped with Arlo cameras.  \nThe Court finds these allegations sufficient to establish at the pleading stage that the scans Arlo \n \n4 Plaintiffs argue that biometric identifiers are distinct from biometric information under BIPA, so \nthat biometric identifiers need not be capable of being used to identify an individual, but the Ninth \nCircuit rejected this argument in Zellmer  (decided subsequent to Plaintiffs’ submission of their \nopposition brief). See Opp’n 11; Zellmer , 2024 WL 3016946, at *4  (“We join the other courts to \nhave considered this issue and reject Zellmer’s argument” that “while biometric information \nrequires the ability to ‘identify an individual,’ biometric identifiers have no such explicit \nrequirement.’”).

Section 15(b)  Arguments  \nArlo next argues that Plaintiffs do not state a claim under Section 15(b) because (1) \nPlaintiffs do not allege that Arlo actively collected their biometric data, but rather that Arlo \npassively captured scans only after homeowners activated the Person Detec tion feature, see Mot. \n17–19, and (2) Section 15(b) does not require impossible notice and consent from individuals who \nare strangers to Arlo, id. at 20 –21.   \nThe Court finds Arlo’s first argument thoroughly unpersuasive.  Contrary to Arlo’s \nposition, Plai ntiffs do not “claim their ‘infrared scans’ were collected by ‘homeowners.’”  See \nMot. 18.  It is plainly not Plaintiffs’ theory that homeowners are collecting and storing the scans of \nindividuals who arrive at their doors.  Rather, Plaintiffs expressly al lege that Arlo’s cameras scan \nthe faces, bodies, and hands of visitors to homes equipped with Arlo’s home security system, see \nFAC ¶ 2; that Arlo then stores the scans in an electronic database, see id. ¶¶ 28, 42; and that if a \nhomeowner activates a featur e such as Person Detection, then Arlo alerts the homeowner when a \nperson is detected by the camera, see id.  ¶ 24.

See, e.g. ,  Jacobs v. Hanwha Techwin Am., Inc. , \n2021 WL 3172967, at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 27, 2021) (“[F]or §  15(b)’s requirements to apply, an \nentity must, at a minimum, take an active step to collect, captu re, purchase, or otherwise obtain \nbiometric data .”) \nArlo’s  second  argument  specific to Section 15(b) —i.e., that it is too far removed from \nPlaintiffs, such that it would be practically impossible to provide notice and obtain consent —relies \non the district court’s decision in Zellmer v. Facebook, Inc. , No. 18 -cv-01880, 2022 WL 976981 \n(N.D. Cal. Mar. 31, 2022).  However, on appeal, the Ninth Circuit  stated that the district court’s \ndecision “ turned on the practical impossibility of Meta ’s complying with BIPA if it had to obtain \nconsent from everyone whose photo was uploaded to Facebook ,” but that “this conclusion was \nwrong” because “the plain text applies to everyone whose biometric identifiers or information is \nheld by Facebook.”  Zellmer , 2024 WL 3016946, at  *4.  Arlo’s second argument —made before \nthe Ninth Circuit’s issuance of Zellmer —must therefore be rejected.  \nd. Section 15(a) Arguments  \nArlo lastly argues that Plaintiffs’ Section 15(a) claim must be dismissed because (1) Arlo \nhas a publicly available policy that complies with the retention periods set forth in Section 15(a); \n(2) Plaintiffs lack statutory standing to bring the claim becaus e they were not themselves \naggrieved by Arlo’s alleged violation of the retention policy because Arlo’s retention duty is owed \nto the public at large rather than individuals; and (3) Plaintiffs fail to allege that Arlo “possessed” \ntheir biometric data.  See Mot. 21 –23.  These arguments are unavailing.  \nFirst, the policy put forth by Arlo —of which the Court has taken judicial notice, see supra , \nat 11 n.3 —does not address Section 15(a)’s requirement that companies “ develop a written policy, \nmade available to t he public, establishing a retention schedule and guidelines for permanently \ndestroying biometric identifiers and biometric information .”  740 ILCS 14/15(a).  Instead, the \npolicy states that “Arlo permanently and immediately deletes videos after a subscribe r deletes a \nvideo, or after expiration of the applicable retention period for the subscription plan of the Case 5:23-cv-05096-EKL     Document 50     Filed 06/27/24     Page 15 of 17 \nCase No.: 23-cv-05096 -EJD \nORDER DENYING  DEFT.’S MOT.

Jud. Not, Exh. 6.  Regardless of the truth of this statement —which the \nCourt does not consider —the policy does not discuss bio metric identifiers and biometric \ninformation, particularly as Plaintiffs allege that Arlo stores the scans at issue in an electronic \ndatabase.  See FAC ¶ 42 ; see also Rivera v. Google, Inc. , 238 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1096 (N.D. Ill. \n2017) (“ The bottom line is that a ‘biometric identifier ’ is not the underlying medium itself , or a \nway of taking measurements, but instead is a set of measurements of a specified physical \ncomponent (eye, finger, voice, hand, face) used to identify a perso n.”) (emphasis added).  \nSecon d, Arlo’s argument that Plaintiffs lack statutory standing  (as distinct from Article III \nstanding)  must also be  rejected .  BIPA provides that “[a]ny person aggrieved by a violation of \n[BIPA] shall have a right of action in a State circuit court or as a sup plemental claim in federal \ndistrict court against an offending party.”  740 ILCS 14/20.  Arlo relies on a Seventh Circuit \ndecision finding that the plaintiff lacked  Article III standing to bring a Section 15(a) claim because \nan entity’s policy disclosure d uty was “owed to the public generally, not to particular persons \nwhose biometric data the entity collects.”  Mot. 22 (quoting Bryant , 958 F.3d at 626).  However, \nthe Seventh Circuit specifically stated that given its finding as to Article III standing, it had “ no \nauthority and no occasion to address her state -court standing to bring this claim .”  Bryant , 658 \nF.3d at 626.  Here, the Court has found that Plaintiffs have Article III standing to bring their \nSection 15(a) claim under Ninth Circuit law because th ey have sufficiently alleged a concrete and \nparticularized injury.  See supra , at Part III(B)(1).  For the same reasons, the Court finds that \nPlaintiffs have alleged that they are “aggrieved” by the violation of Section 15(a).  \nThird, Arlo argues that Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege its “possession” of their \nbiometric data, i.e., that Arlo had control of the biometric data, as opposed to the homeowners .  \nSee Mot. 22 –23.  But the FAC plainly alleges that Arlo “stored and use d” biometric identifiers to o \nprovide its Person Detection feature, FAC ¶ 12, and that Arlo is unable to accomplish its person \ndetection tasks without “collect[ing], us[ing], and stor[ing]” the identifiers, id. ¶ 26.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a class action lawsuit against Clearview AI, Inc., and related defendants, alleging violations under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) as well as various state laws. Plaintiffs claim Clearview AI unlawfully collected, analyzed, and sold biometric information scraped from internet images using artificial intelligence algorithms. The court partially granted and partially denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, upholding most of the plaintiffs' claims.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the use of artificial intelligence by Clearview AI to collect and analyze individuals' biometric data without consent violates BIPA and constitutes an infringement of privacy rights under various state laws.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied the motion to dismiss most of the claims, finding that the plaintiffs have adequately alleged violations of privacy laws, particularly emphasizing the misuse of biometric data obtained through AI technology. The court ruled that plaintiffs sufficiently alleged claims under BIPA and other state laws, except for the New York unjust enrichment claim which was preempted by existing law.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine if someone secretly took your unique fingerprints and face features from photos you posted online and put them in a giant database without telling you. Then, they made this powerful tool that can recognize people just by uploading any photo, and they sold access to this tool to other people. That's sort of what Clearview AI is accused of doing with people's face data using very smart computer algorithms. The court mostly decided that people have a right to protect this kind of personal data and that Clearview should face the lawsuit for potentially breaking privacy laws.",

Plaintiffs bring \nclaims under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”) , as well \nas statutory and common la w claims under Virginia, California, and New York  law.  Before the \nCourt is  the Clearview defendants’  motion to dismiss under Federal Rule s of Civil Procedure \n12(b)( 1) and 12(b)(6) .  For the following reasons,  the Court  grants in part and denies in part the \nClearview defendants’ motion.   \nBackground  \n \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its prior rulings in this multi -district litigation.  In their \nfirst amended consolidated class action complaint, pl aintiffs a llege that the Clearview defendants’ \nconduct violated their privacy rights and that defendants’ use of their biometric information was \nwithout their knowledge and consent.  Plaintiffs  specifically  allege  that the Clearview defendants \ncovertly scraped over three  billion photographs of facial images from the internet and then used \nartificial intelligence algorithms to scan the face geometry of each individual depicted  to harvest the \nindividuals’ unique biometric identifiers and corresponding biometric information.    \nThe centerpiece of this multi -district litigation and plaintiffs’ class action lawsuit is  BIPA.   \nThe Illinois General Assembly “ enacted BIPA in 2008 in response to the growing use of biometrics Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 1 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n ‘in the business and security screening sectors .’”  Fox v. Dakkota Integrated Sys., LLC,  980 F.3d 1146, \n1149 ( 7th Cir. 2020)  (quoting 740 ILCS 14/5).  The legislative findings include: \nBiometrics are unlike other unique identifiers that are used to access finances or \nother sensitive information.  For example, s ocial security numbers, when \ncompromised, can be changed.  Biometrics, however, are  biologically  unique  to the \nindividual; therefore, once compromised, the individual has no recourse, is at \nheightened risk for identity theft, and is likely to withdraw from  biometric -facilitated \ntransactions.  \n \n740 ILCS 14/5(c).  The Illinois General Assembly further concluded that  “[t]he public welfare, \nsecurity, and safety will be served by regulating the collection, use, safeguarding, handling, storage, \nretention, and destruction of biometric identifiers and information.”   740 ILCS 14/5(g).  \nThe Illinois Supreme Court has explained that through BIPA , “our General Assembly has \ncodified that individuals possess a right to privacy in and control over their bi ometric identifiers and \nbiometric information.”  Rosenbach v. Six Flags Ent m’t Corp ., 129 N.E.3d 1197, 1206, 432 Ill.Dec. 654, \n663, 2019 IL 123186, ¶ 33 ( Ill. 2019) .  As the Seventh Circuit has noted, BIPA “ is designed to \nprotect consumers against the threat of irreparable privacy harms, identity theft, and other economic \ninjuries arising from the increasing use of biometric identifiers and information by private entities.”   \nBryant v. Compass Group USA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, 619 ( 7th Cir. 2020) . \nLegal Sta ndards  \nA Rule  12(b)(1) motion challenges federal jurisdiction, including Article III standing, and the \nparty invoking jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing the elements necessary for subject matter \njurisdiction, including standing .  Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc. , 984 F.3d 1241, 1244 ( 7th Cir. 2021) ; \nInternational  Union  of Operating  Eng’rs v. Daley , 983 F.3d 287, 294 (7th Cir. 2020) .  Under  Rule 12(b)(1), \nthe Court accepts all well -pleaded factual allegations as true and construes all reasonable inferences \nin the plaintiff ’s favor when a defendant is facially attack ed standing .  Prairie Rivers Network v. Dynegy \nMidwest Generation, LLC , 2 F.4th 1002, 1007 ( 7th Cir. 2021).   \nA motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim tests the sufficiency Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 2 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n of the complaint, not its merits .  Skinner v. Switzer , 562 U.S. 521, 529, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 179 L.Ed.2d  \n233 (2011).  When considering dismissal of a complaint, t he Court accepts all well -pleaded factual \nallegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.  Erickson v. Pardus , 551 \nU.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam ).  To survive a motion to dismiss, \nplaint iff must “state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 \nU.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).  A complaint is facially plausible when the \nplaintiff alleges  enough “factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that \nthe defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”   Ashcroft  v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. \n1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) . \nDiscu ssion  \nFirst Amendment  \nThe Court starts with the parties’ First A mendment arguments , keeping in mind that state \nstatutes are presumed constitutional .  Heller v. Doe by Doe , 509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S.Ct. 2637 , 125 \nL.Ed.2d 257 ( 1993) .  The Supreme Court recognizes that First Amendment protections and state -\nprotected privacy interests  can clash .  See The Fl orida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524, 533, 109 S.Ct. 2603, \n105 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989).  As the Florida Star  Court reasoned, “ the sensitivity and significance of the \ninterests presented in clashes  between First Amendment and privacy rights counsel relying on \nlimited principles that sweep no more broadly than the appropriate context of the instant case.”  Id . \nat 533.  Accordingly, a t this stage of the proceedings, the C ourt must review pla intiffs’ allegations in \ndetail and examine the First Amendment arguments narrowly in order to strike a balance between \nprivacy interests and the interests protected by the First Amendment.  See id .; Snyder v. Phelps , 562 \nU.S. 443, 462, 131 S.Ct. 1207, 179 L.Ed.2d 172 (2011)  (Breyer, J., concurrence).  \nViewing plaintiffs’ allegations as true  and in their favor , plaintiffs  allege the Clearview \ndefen dants covertly scraped over three billion photographs of facial images from the internet and Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 3 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n then used artificial intelligence algorithms to scan the face geometry of each photograph to harvest \nthe individuals’ unique biometric identifiers  and information.  Clearview then created a searchable \ndatabase containing th is biometric  information and data that allow s users to identify unknown \nindividuals by uploading a photograph to the database.  The database can be searched remotely by \nlicensed users of Clearview ’s web ap plication.  Plaintiffs further a llege that t he Clearview defendants \nhave collected, captured, or otherwise obtained their biometric data without notice and consent , and \nthereafter , sold or otherwise  profited from their biometric information.  \nHere , the Clearview defendants maintain that the capture of faceprints from public images \nand Clearview’s analysis of the public faceprints is protected speech , and thus , BIPA violates the \nFirst Amendment by inhibiting Clearview’s ability to collect  and analyze  public information.  See  \nSorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S. 552, 570, 131 S.Ct. 2653, 180 L.Ed.2d 544 (2011)  (“This Court has \nheld that the creation and dissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the First \nAmendment .”).  Plaintiffs , however, assert that the capturing of faceprints and the action of \nextracting private  biometric identifiers from the faceprints is unprotected conduct.  See Rumsfeld  v. \nForum  for Acad.  & Institutional  Rights,  Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 66, 126 S. Ct. 1297, 164 L.Ed. 2d 156 (2006).   \nThe Clearview defendants’ argument oversimplifies plaintiffs’ allegations.  A lthough \nClearview capture s public photographs from the internet, according to plaintiffs ’ allegations, \nClearview then harvests an individual’s unique biometric identifiers  and information—which are not \npublic information— without the individual’s consent.  Put differently, plaintiffs assert  that t he \nClearview defendants’ business model is not based on the collection of public photographs from the \ninternet , some source code, and republishing information via a search engine, but the additional \nconduct of harvesting nonpublic, personal biometric data.  And, a s plaintiffs fu rther allege, u nlike \nfingerprints, facial biometrics are readily observable and  present a grave and immediate danger to Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 4 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n privacy, individual autonomy, and liberty .  See Fox , 980 F.3d at 1155 ( biometric identifiers  \n“are immutable , and once compromised, are compromised forever ”). \nAccordingly, Clearview’s process in creating its database involves both speech and \nnonspeech elements .  When these “ elements are combined in the same course of conduct, a \nsufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element can justify  \nincidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms .”  U nited States v. O ’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 \nS.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968) .  Under the se circumstances, the Court applies the intermediate \nscrutiny  standard elucidated  in O’Brien , namely, a regulation does not violate the First Amendment if \n(1) it is within the power of the government  to enact , (2) furthers an important government interest, \n(3) the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and (4) any \ninciden tal restriction on speech is no greater than is necessary to further th e government interest.  Id . \nat 377;  Foxxxy Ladyz Adult World, Inc. v. Village of Dix, Ill., 779 F.3d 706, 712 ( 7th Cir. 2015) . \nThe parties do not discuss the power of the Illinois General Assembly to enact BIPA , \ntherefore, the Court turns to the second O’Brien  prong .  The G eneral Assembly enacted BIPA to \nprotect Illinois  residents’ highly sensitiv e biometric information from unauthorized collection and \ndisclosure.  See  740 ILCS 14/5(c) ; Rosenbach,  129 N.E.3d at 1206.   Next, BIPA , including its \nexceptions, does not restrict a pa rticular viewpoint  nor target public discussion of an entire topic  \nunder the third O’Brien  requirement .  See Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz ., 576 U.S. 155, 169, 135 S.Ct. \n2218, 192 L.Ed.2d 236 (2015) ; Dahlstrom v. Sun -Times Media, LLC , 777 F.3d 937, 944 n.5 ( 7th Cir. \n2015) .  Under O’Brien’s  fourth factor, BIPA is narrowly tailored by legitimately protec ting Illinois \nresidents’ highly  sensitive biometric information and data, yet allow ing residents to share their \nbiometric  information through its consent provision.   See, e.g., People v. Austin , 155 N.E.3d 439, 468, \n440 Ill.Dec. 669, 698, 2019 IL 123910, ¶ 93 (Ill. 2019) (discussing Illinois’ revenge porn statute ).  \nLast, BIPA is not overly -broad.  See Center for Individual Freedom v. Madigan , 697 F.3d 464, 471 ( 7th Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 5 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n Cir. 2012) (“A st atute is facially overbroad only when ‘it prohibits a substantial amount of protected \nspeech.’”) (quoting  United  States  v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292, 128 S.Ct. 1830, 170 L.Ed.2d 650 \n(2008) ).  The Court denies defendants’ motion to dismiss in this respect.   \nExtraterritoria lity Doctrine  \nThe Court next turns to the Clearview defendants’ contention that plaintiffs’ BIPA claims \nviolate Illinois’ extraterritoriality doctrine.  Because BIPA does not expressly intend to operate \nextraterritorially, the alleged BIPA violations must have taken place in Illinois.  See Avery  v. State  Farm  \nMut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 216 Ill.2d 100, 296 Ill.Dec. 448, 835 N.E.2d 801, 852 ( Ill. 2005) .  In Avery , the \nIllinois Supreme Court concluded that “there is no single formula or bright -line test for determining \nwhether a transaction occurs within thi s state.”  Id . at 187.  The critical question is whether the \ncircumstances relating to the violations occurred “ primarily ” and “ substantially ” in Illinois.  Id .  In \nmaking this inquiry, courts look to “ the residency of the plaintiff, the location of harm, \ncommunications between parties (where sent and where received), and where a company policy is \ncarried out. ”  Rivera v. Google Inc ., 238 F.Supp.3d 1088, 1101 (N.D. Ill. 2017)  (Chang, J.) . \nPlaintiffs allege that the Illinois subclass are Illinois residents, the Clearview defendants failed \nto provide notice to the Illinois subclass members in Illinois, and defendants trespassed on the \nIllinois subclass members’ private domains in Illinois.  Also, plaint iffs maintain that defendants  have  \ncontracted with hundreds of Illinois entities, both public and private.  Construing the allegations in \nplaintiffs’ favor, they have plausibly alleged that the relevant  BIPA violations occurred primarily and \nsubstantially in Illinois  despite Clearview’s contention that the alleged violations took place in New \nYork  because the scraping of facial images and creation of the searchable database took place there.   \nThat said, t he Court , recognizes  that the applicati on of the extraterritoriality doctrine is a fact  intense \ninquiry that is best left for summary judgment  once the parties have co mpleted  discovery.   See Rivera , \n238 F.Supp.3d at 1102; Vance v. IBM, Case No. 20 C 0577, 2020 WL 5530134, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 6 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n 2020)  (Kocoras, J.) .  The Court denies defendants’ motion to dismiss based on the extraterritoriality \ndoctrine.  \nDormant Commerce Clause  \nThe Clearview defendants also argue that BIPA, as sought to be appl ied here, violates the \nDormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.  “ While the Commerce Clause,  U.S. \nCONST.  art. I § 8, cl. 3, explicitly grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce among the \nStates, it has long been understood that it also directly limits t he power of the States to discriminate \nagainst or burden interstate commerce.”  Alliant Energy Corp. v. Bie , 330 F.3d 904, 911 (7th Cir. 2003) .  \nThe restraint on the power of states to regulate commerce is referred to as the Do rmant C ommerce \nClause.  Regan v. City of Hammond, Ind ., 934 F.3d 700, 702 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Dormant Commerce \nClause prohibits “ the application of a state statute to co mmerce that takes places  wholly  outside  of \nthe State’s borders, whether or not the commerce has effects within the State.”   Healy  v. Beer Inst., \nInc., 491 U.S. 324, 336, 109 S.Ct. 2491, 105 L.Ed.2d 275 (1989) . \nAs discuss ed, plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the BIPA violations occurred primarily \nand substantially in Illinois, therefore,  the violations did not take place “wholly outside” of Illinois.  \nMeanwhile, i n support of their argument,  the Clearview defendants rel y on facts that are not alleged \nin the first amended consolidated class action complaint, including that Illinois residences make up \nonly a small percentage of  its database —facts the Court cannot consider at this juncture .  See Smith v. \nBurge, 222 F.Supp.3d 669, 691 (N.D. Ill. 2016) (St. Eve, J.) ( “defendant cannot, in presenting its \n12(b)(6) challenge, attempt to refute the complaint or to present a different set of allegations”) \n(citation omitted).   As with the Clearview defendants’ related extrat erritoriality arguments, whether \nBIPA controls commercial conduct that occur s wholly outside Illinois is a question best left for later \nin these proceedings after the parties have completed discovery.  See Rivera , 238 F.3d at 1104; Vance, Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 7 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n 2020 WL 5530134, at *3.  The Court denies defendants’ motion to dismiss  based on the Dormant \nCommerce Clause.  \nBIPA and Photographs  \nThe Clearview defendants additionally argue that under the plain language of the statute, \nBIPA expressly excludes photographs and inf ormation derived from photographs from its reach.  \nTo explain, BIPA defines biometric identifier as follows:  \n“Biometric identifier” means a retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of \nhand or face geometry.  Biometric identifiers do not include writing samples, written \nsignatures, photographs, human biological samples used for valid scientific testing or \nscreening, demographic data, tattoo descriptions, or physical descriptions such as \nheight, weight, hair color, or eye color[.]  \n \n740 ILCS 14/10.  \n \nIn support of their argument, the Clearview defendants do not mention the Northern \nDistrict of Illinois cases that have addressed this exact argument, nor do they mention this argument \nin their reply brief.  This is probably because Illinois courts  have uniformly rejected the argument \nthat BIPA exempts biometric data extracted from photographs.  As Judge Chang explained in Rivera , \na “‘biometric identifier ’ is not the underlying medium itself, or a way of taking measurements, but \ninstead is a set of measurements of a specified physical component (eye, finger, voice, hand, face) \nused to identify a person.”   Rivera , 238 F.Supp.3d at 1096; see also  Flores  v. Motorola Solutions, Inc. , No. \n21-cv-1128, 2021 WL 232627, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 8, 2021) (Norgle, J.)  (“The Court cannot say that \nthose protections do not apply to any publicly published photographs of individuals —especially \ngiven that the biometric data in this case is the facial geometry of the class members, in contrast to \nthe photos themse lves.”).  The Court finds these opinions persuasive and denies defendants’ motion \nto dismiss on this basis.   \nIndividual Defendants’ Liab ility \nNext, d efendants assert  that the individual defendants, Ton- That, and Schwartz , should be Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 8 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n dismissed from this lawsuit because they cannot be held liable for actions they took as Clearview’s \nofficers or employees.  In response, plaintiffs argue that the individual defendants can be liable for \nClearview’s conduct because they personally participated in the alleged tortious conduct , and, in the \nalternative,  are alter egos of Clearview.  D efendants note  that the law of the state of incorporation, \nDelaware, applies  to plaintiffs’ arguments .  On Command Video Corp. v. Roti , 705 F.3d 267, 272 ( 7th \nCir. 2013)  (“veil-piercing claims are governed by the law of the state of the corporation whose veil is \nsought to be pierced”).   Plaintiffs maintain that Illinois and Delaware law yield the same result.  \nExamining the personal participation doctrine, “[ a]s the human through which the corporate \nprincipal acts, ‘ [a] corporate  officer can be held personally liable for the torts he commits and cannot \nshield himself behind a corporation when he is a participant. ’”  Prairie Capital III, L.P. v. Double E \nHolding Corp ., 132 A.3d 35, 60 (Del. Ch. 2015)  (citation omitted) ; see also Brasby v. Morris, Case No. \n05C-10-022-RFS, 2007 WL 949485, at *8 (Del. Super.  Mar. 9, 2007) (“The personal participation \ndoctrine s tands for the idea that, in certain situations, an officer in a corporation can be held liable \nfor his own wrongful acts .”).  Likewise, under Illinois law, “[c] orporate officers are generally not \nliable for corporate obligations,” however, they “are liable for any tort of the corporation in which \nthey participate.”   IOS Capital, Inc. v. Phoenix Printing, Inc., 808 N.E.2d 606, 611, 283 Ill.Dec. 640, 348 \nIll.App.3d 366 (4 th Dist.  2004) .  \nPlaintiffs allege that Ton- That, the co -founder and Chief Executive Officer of Clearview , \nand Schwartz, the co -founder and Clearview’s President, participated in, consented to, approved, \nauthorized,  and directed the wrongful acts alleged  in the complaint.1  Further, p laintiffs  state  that \nTon- That and Schwartz authorized and directed the scheme to collect and distribute biometrics, \nexecuted agreements on Clearview’s behalf, and treated the biometric database as their own.  \n \n1 Plaintiffs do not argue that Clearview’s General Counsel, Thomas Mulcaire, personally participated in the \nprivacy tort s by directing, ordering, ratifying, approving, or consenting to the tortious acts .  Therefore, he is \nnot individually liable for Clearview’s actions.  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 9 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n Plaintiffs’ allegations —viewed in their favor —plausibly sugges t that Ton -That and Schwartz acted \noutside  of their corporate capacit ies because these corporate officers personal ly participated in the \nprivacy tort  by direct ing, order ing, ratif ying, approv ing, or consent ing to the tortious act.   See Brandt \nv. Rokeby Realty Co. , Case No. C.A. 97C -10-132-RFS, 2004 WL 2050519, at *10 (Del. Super. Sept. 8, \n2004) .  Because plaintiffs have adequately alleged that Ton -That and Schwartz acted outside of their \ncorporate capacities when they personal ly violated BIPA and plaintiffs’ other privacy claims,  the \nCourt denies defendants’ motion to dismiss individual defendants Ton- That and Schwartz .  These \nallegations also defeat defendants’ fiduciary shield arguments , see Mutnick v. Clearview AI, Inc., Nos. 20 \nC 0512, 20 C 0846, 2020 WL 4676667, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 12, 2020) (Coleman, J.) , arguments that \ndefendants developed for the first time in their reply brief.   See White , 8 F.4th at 552 (“ arguments \nraised for the first time in [a] reply  brief are waived”).  \nAs to the  parties’ alter ego/veil piercing arguments, “Delaware courts consider a number of \nfactors in determining whether to disregard the corporate form and pierce the corporate veil, \nincluding: ‘(1) whether the company was adequately capitalized for the undertaking; (2) whether the \ncompany was solvent; (3) whether corporate formalities were observed; (4) whether the dominant \nshareholder siphoned company funds; and (5) whether, in general, the company simply functioned \nas a façade  for the dominant shareholder.’”   Manichaean Capital, LLC v. Exela Tech., Inc., 251 A.3d \n694, 706 (Del. Ch. 2021) (citation omitted) ; see also Steiner Elec. Co. v. Maniscalco , 51 N.E.3d 45, 57, 401 \nIll.Dec. 852, 864, 2016 IL App (1st) 132023, ¶ 47 (1st Dist. 2016).  In addition, both Illinois and \nDelaware law  “require [] that the corporate structure cause fraud or similar  injustice .”  Wallace ex rel. \nCencom Cable Income Partners II, Inc., L.P. v.

Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 10 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n Although there are some allegations  in plaintiffs’ first amended complaint  that corporate \nformalities were not always observed at Clearview , such as Clearvie w direct ing its customers to send \npayments to Schwartz’s personal residence and that Schwartz paid for the servers and other costs \nnecessary to carry out Clearview’s scraping and biometric scanning operations , plaintiffs have  not \nadequately alleg ed any other veil pie rcing  factors.  For instance, viewing the allegations in their favor, \nplaintiffs have not provided sufficient  factual detail that Clearview simply functioned as Ton- That’s \nand Schwartz ’s façade .  Furthermore, plaintiffs’ complaint lacks detail ed allegations  supporting their \nargument that Ton- That and Schwartz undercapitalized Clearview.  In the end, plaintiffs’ allegations \nsupporting their alter ego theory of individual liability as to Ton- That and Schwartz do not \nwithstand defendants’  motion to dismiss , especially  because piercing the corporate veil is disfavored \nunder both Delaware and Illinois law.  Judson  Atkinson  Candies,  Inc. v. Latini –Hohberger  Dhimantec,  529 \nF.3d 371, 379 (7th Cir. 2008) ; see also Wallace ex rel. Cencom Cable Income Partners II, Inc., L.P. v. Wood , \n752 A.2d 1175, 1183 (Del.  Ch. 1999) ( “Persuading a Delaware court to disregard the corporate entity \nis a difficult task.”) (citation omitted).   The Court grants defendants’ motion in relation to these alter \nego allegations.  \nDefendant Rocky Mountain2 \nPlaintiffs seek to pierce Rocky Mountain Data Analytics’ LLC corporate veil to hold the \nparent company, Clearview, liable for Rocky Mountain’s actions.  By way of background, Thomas \nMulcaire was Clearview’s General Counsel and Vice President of defendant Rocky Mounta in during \nthe relevant time period, and Rocky Mountain was a special purpose entity used for the sole purpose \n \n2  In a cursory footnote  in their opening brief , defendants argue Thomas Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain \nshould also be dismissed because the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them.   Defe ndants have waived \nthis argument.  See  White v. United States , 8 F.4th 547, 552 (7th Cir. 2021) (“ perfunctory and undeveloped \narguments, as well as arguments that are unsupported by pertinent authority, are waived.”).   Moreover, \ndefendants’ February 2, 2022 notice of supplemental authority adds little, if anything, to their waived \nargument.  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 11 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n of contracting with the Illinois Secretary of State .  Rocky Mountain provided the Illinois Secretary of \nState access to the Clearview database and  biometrics contained therein.   \nIn Delaware, parent “liability may be permissible under either of two distinct theories: (1) the \nalter ego theory, or (2) the agency theory. ”  British Telecomm . v. IAC/InteractiveCorp , 356 F.Supp.3d \n405, 409 (D. Del.  2019).  Under the agency theory, “ a parent corporation is held liable for the \nactions of its subsidiary if the parent directed or authorized those actions.”  Id . (citation omitted) ; see \nalso Chrysler Corp. (Delaware) v. Chaplake Holdings, Ltd. , 822 A.2d 1024, 1035 (Del. 2003) .  “Stated \nanother way, when a subsidiary acts as the agent of the parent corporation, the parent corporation \nmay be liable for actions conducted by the agent.”   British Telecomm. , 356 F.Supp.3d at 409.  For “a \nparent corporation to be liable under the agency test, there must be a ‘close connection between the \nrelationship of the corporations and the cause of action, ’ focusing on ‘ the arrangement between the \nparent and the subsidiary, the authority given in that arrangement, and the relevance of that \narrangement to the plaintiff ’s claim.’ ”  Garza v. Citigroup Inc., 192 F.Supp.3d 508, 514 (D. Del. 2016)  \n(citation omitted).  \n Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Rocky Mountain acted as an agent of Clearview.  \nSpeci fically, they assert Ton -That and Schwartz were directly involved in the creation of Rocky \nMountain and were responsible for allowing Rocky Mountain to sell access to the Clearview \ndatabase to its sole customer, the Illinois Secretary of State.  Plaintiffs  further allege  that Ton- That, \nSchwartz , and Mulcaire authorized and directed a  Clearview salesperson to double as a Rocky \nMountain salesperson, knowing that the salesperson would be paid by Clearview.   Plaintiffs also  \nstate that Ton- That and Schwartz authorized Mulcaire to provide his personal  information to the \nIllinois Secretary o f State, resulting in the Illinois  Secretary of State submitting a voucher to the \nIllinois Comptroller authorizing payment to Mulcaire.   Other allegations include that Rocky \nMountain’s activities, which included collecting, obtaining, distributing, dissemi nating, selling,  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 12 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n leasing , and profiting from the biometrics , were at the direction of Ton- That and Schwartz.   Not \nonly did Ton- That and Schwartz fail to adequately  capitalize Rocky Mountain , they  admit that Rocky \nMountain had no actual operations .  Last, d efendants have waived their argument made for the first \ntime in their reply brief that Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain are exempt based on 740 ILCS 14/25(e).  \nSee White , 8 F.4th at 552.  The Court therefore denies this aspect of defendants’ motion.  \nBIPA Section 15(c) C laim \nDefendants nex t contend that plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently a llege a c laim under 740 \nILCS 14/15(c), which prohibits private entities from selling, leasing, trading, or  otherwise  profit ing \nfrom a person’s biometric identifiers or information.   Defendants specifically argue that none of \nplaintiffs’ factual allegations describe s Clearview’s customers receiving access to the Clearview \ndatabase  or that the customers receive d access to plaintiffs’ biometric information.  Despite this \nargument, the fir st amended consolidated class action complaint repeatedly states (1) defendants \ndeveloped their technology for their own profit; (2) defendants sold, distributed, disseminated, traded , leased, and otherwise profited from the biometric database; (3) defenda nts sold access to the \ndatabase to more than 200 private companies who searched the biometric database for their \nbusiness purposes; and (4) defendants profited from selling access to the database.  Plaintiffs’ \nallegations state a plausible BIPA 15(c) claim .  See Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 679 (“Determining whether a \ncomplaint states a plausible  claim for relief” is “a context -specific task that requires the reviewing \ncourt to draw on its judicial experience and  common  sense .”).  \nNevertheless, defendants maintain that the statute’s language “otherwise profit from” \nindicates that BIPA 15(c) prohibits only the sale of biometric data, not the business of using biometric technology.  At its core, plaintiffs’ claim  concerns  the sale of biometric data because the \nClearview defendants’ business model is premised on collecting and capturing biometric data and then profiting from that data when customers pay to search the Clearview database.  Thus, when a Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 13 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n customer pays to search the database  containing plaintiffs’ biometric information to find a potential \nmatch, defendants profit from plaintiffs’ biometric data in violation of BIPA 15(c).  See Flores , 2021 \nWL 232627, at *3.  Therefore, defendants’ argument is without merit . \nStanding for State Law Claims  \nThe Clearview d efendants additionally argue that plaintiffs do not have Article III standing \nto bring their claims under California, Virginia, and New York state law.  “ Article  III of the \nConstitution limits the federal judicial power to deciding ‘ Cases ’ and ‘ Controversies’” and “as an \nessential part of a federal court ’s authority under Article III, [the] standing doctrine ensures respect \nfor these jurisdictional bounds.”   Prairie Rivers  Network,  2 F.4th at 1007.  To establish standing under \nArticle III, a plaintiff must show: (1) he suffered an injury -in-fact; (2) that is fairly traceable to the \ndefendants ’ conduct; and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.   Cothron v. \nWhite Castle System, Inc.,  20 F.4th 1156, 1160 ( 7th Cir. 2021) .  Under the first requirement, an injury -\nin-fact must be “concrete and particularized” and “actual  or imminent.”   Prosser  v. Becerra , 2 F.4th \n708, 713 (7th Cir. 2021).  Defendants focus on the injury -in-fact requirement argu ing that plaintiffs \nhave not suffered any  cognizable injuries, such as identity theft.  \nTo determine whether the disclosure of plaintiffs’ private information caused a  sufficiently \nconcrete harm to support standing , courts look to both history and the judgment of Congress  for \nguidance.  Gadelhak  v. AT&T Servs.,  Inc., 950 F.3d 458, 462 (7th Cir. 2020) (Barrett, J.) .  The \nhistorical inquiry asks, “whether the asserted harm has a ‘close relationship’ to a harm traditionally \nrecognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts —such as physical harm, monetary \nharm, or various intangible harms.”  TransUnion , LLC v. Ramirez , 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2200 (2021) .  As \nthe TransUnion  Court clarified, “[v]arious intangible harms can also be concrete” including \n“reputational harms, disclosure of private information, and intrusion upon seclusion.” Id.  at 2204.   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 14 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that defendants’ disclosure of their private in formation \nwithout their consent caused them the concrete harm of violating their privacy interests in their \nbiometric data.   In addition, the nonconsensual taking of plainti ffs’ private information is a concrete \nharm because the possibility of misuse is ever present.  Because plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged a concrete harm supporting Article III standing, the Court denies defendants’ motion in this respect.  \nVirginia State Law Claims  \n In Counts Eight and Nine of the first amended consolidated class action complaint, plaintif f \nShelby Zelonis Roberson, on behalf of herself a nd others similarly situated in the Virginia Subclass, \nbring s two claim s under Virginia law, including , the Virginia statu te prohibiting the unauthorized use \nof names or pictures, Virginia Code § 8.01- 40(A) , as alleged in Count Eight.  V irginia Code §  8.01-\n40(A) states:  \nAny person whose name, portrait, or picture is used without having first obtained \nthe written consent of such person, or if dead, of the surviving consort and if none, \nof the next of kin, or if a minor, the written consent of his or her parent or guardian, \nfor adver tising purposes or for the purposes of trade , such persons may maintain \na suit in equity  against the person, firm, or corporation so using such person’ s name.  \n \n(emphasis added).   \nIn their motion, defendants argue plaintiffs have failed to allege that defe ndants used their \nlikenesses for advertising purpose s, but the statute unequivocally states  that plaintiffs may also \nestablish a claim under §  8.01- 40(A)  if defendants used their likenesses  for the purposes of trade.  \nTown & Country Prop . Inc. v. Riggins , 457 S.E.2d 356, 362, 249 Va. 387, 394 (Va. 1995)  (“Use for \n‘advertising purposes’ and use ‘for the purposes of trade’ are separate and distinct statutory \nconcepts. ”).  “In determining whether the use was ‘ for the purposes of trade, ’ courts are to consider \nwhether the [picture] was used to draw trade to an entity. ”  Goodweather v. Parekh , No. 20- cv-0006, \n2020 WL 9259760, at *10 (E.D. Va.  Sept. 18, 2020) .  Here, plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 15 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n the Clearview defendants profited from the unconsented use of their likenesses  under “for purposes \nof trade .”   \nNonetheless, the Clearview defendants maintain plaintiffs’ publicity  right claim fails because \nthe use of plaintiffs’ photographs  or likeness  has a protected public interest purpose.  See  Wiest v. E -\nFense, Inc., 356 F.Supp.2d 604, 611 (E.D. Va.  2005)  (“If a name or likeness is used without consent in \nconnection with matters that are ‘ newsworthy ’ or of ‘ public interest, ’ the statute does not apply .”).  \nIn particular, defendants argue that the right to publicity must yield to constitutional free  speech \ninterests.   Keeping in mind that a motion to dismiss concerns the sufficiency of the allegations , the \nCourt rejects defendants’ argument because, as plaintiffs have allege d, the Clearview defendants \nscraped  plaintiffs’ photographs to build a database from which defendants  profit ed and that this \nconduct did not have any connection to public affairs .  Defendants’ cursory arguments about \n“speech interests” does not change this analysis.  T he Court  denies defendants’ motion to dismiss  \nCount Eight.  \n In Count Nine, Roberson alleges the Clearview defendants violated Virginia’s Computer \nCrimes Act  (“VCCA”) , Virginia Code §  18.2-152.1, et seq.  See Hately v. Watts , 917 F.3d 770, 781 ( 4th \nCir. 2019)  (“The Virginia Computer Crimes Act is a criminal statute with a private civil right of \naction .”).  To establish a VCCA claim, plaintiffs must eventually prove the Clearview defendant s: (1) \nused a computer or computer network; (2) without authority; and (3) either obtained  property or \nservices by false pretenses , embezzl ement  or larceny, or convert ed the property of another.   See \nRosciszewski v. Arete Assoc. , Inc., 1 F.3d 225, 230 ( 4th Cir. 1993) ; Cvent, Inc. v. Eventbrite, Inc., 739 \nF.Supp.2d 927, 934 (E.D. Va. 2010) .   \n Defendants first argue that plaintiffs have failed to allege an actual injury, but “[i]n Virginia, \none holds a property interest in one’s name and likeness .” Riggins , 457 S.E.2d at 364.  Here, plaintiffs \nhave stated  an actual injury based on their allegations that defendant s conver ted their likenesses.  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 16 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>17 \n Defendants also contend plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege that Clearview used any \ncomputer or computer network without authority .  Defendants’ argument is without merit because \nplaintiffs allege that defendants scrap ed their  images  in violation of the terms of service of the \nwebsites on which the ir images were hosted and without the  plaintiffs’ consent and that defendants \nconverted their property interest in their likenesses.  In addition, defendants assert that plaintiffs \nfailed “to allege false pretenses, conversion, artifice, tricker, or deception,” although, as discussed, \nplainti ffs clearly allege that defendants converted the ir property interest s.  The Court denies \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss  Count Nine.  \nCalifornia State Law Claim s \n In Counts Ten through Thirteen, plaintiff Andrea Vestrand, on behalf of herself and others \nsimilarly situated in the California Subclass, brings claims under California statutory and common \nlaw.  In Count Ten, Vestrand alleges the Clearview defendants violated California’s Unfair \nCompetition Law (“UCL”)  by using her biometric information without her consent .  To bring a \nclaim under the UCL, a plaintiff  must “(1) establish a loss or deprivation of money or property \nsufficient to quantify as injury in fact, i.e., economic  injury , and (2) show that the economic injury was \nthe result of, i.e.,  caused  by, the unfair business practice.”  Kwikset  Corp.  v. Superior  Court , 51 Cal . 4th \n310, 322, 120 Cal.Rptr.3d 741, 246 P.3d 877 ( Cal. 2011) (emphasis in original) .  \nPlaintiffs’ UCL claim necessarily fails because personal information is not “property” for \npurposes of the UCL .  See In re Facebook Privacy Litig. , 791 F.Supp.2d 705, 714 (N.D. Cal. 2011) .  \nIndeed, “[n]umerous courts have held that disclosure of personal information alone  does not \nconstitute economic or  property  loss sufficient to establish UCL  standing, unless the plaintiff \nprovides specific allegations regarding the value of the information.”  Mastel v. Miniclip SA , ___ \nF.Supp.3d  ___, 2021 WL 2983198, at *11 (E.D. Cal. 2021) .   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 17 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>19 \n The Clearview defendants argue that Vestrand’s common law right to publicity claim fail s \nbecause she does not have an economic interest in her likeness.  Vestrand, however, is not required \nto plead facts corresponding to each legal element of her claim to survive a motion to dismiss, but \ninstead, need only allege a plausible claim.  Chapman  v. Yellow  Cab Cooperative , 875 F.3d  846, 848 (7th  \nCir. 2017) .  Vestrand has done so by alleging that  the Clearview defendants used her photographs \nand likeness without authorization for  commercial gain .  Further, Vestrand alleges the California \nSubclass was injured because the Clearview defendants  did not compensate them for the  use of their \nlikenesses, identifies, and photographs.  These allegations plausibly state a common law right to \npublicity claim under California law.  \nNext, under California’s statutory remedy, § 3344,  plaintiffs must also show “a knowing use \nby the defendant as well as a direct connection between the alleged use and the commercial \npurpose.”  Downing , 265 F.3d at 1001.  Defendants argue that §  3344 requires plaintiffs to allege that \nits use of the Clear view database was for purposes of advertising, selling, or soliciting.  By making \nthis argument, defendants ignore  parts of §  3344(a), which states, “ [a]ny person who knowingly uses \nanother ’s name, voice, signature, photograph, or likeness in any manne r, on or in products, \nmerchandise, or goods, or for purposes of advertising or selling, or  soliciting purchases of, products, \nmerchandise, goods or services, without such person’ s prior consent  … shall be liable for any \ndamages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result thereof. ” (emphasis added).  Thus , \nunder §  3344, plaintiffs need not allege that  defendants used their photos or likenesses for purposes \nof advertising, selling, or so liciting  as defendants argue   As discussed, plaintiffs have adequately \nalleged the Clearview defendants  knowingly used their photos by accessing the Clearview database \nfor a profit .  The Court denies  defendants’  motion to dismiss Counts Eleven and Twelve.  \nIn Count Thirteen, Vestrand al leges defendants  violated her right to privacy under the \nCalifornia Constitution.  To establish a claim for invasion of privacy under the California Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 19 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>20 \n Constitution,  a plaintiff must e ventually show (1) she  possess es a legally protected privacy interest , \n(2) she maintain s a reasonable expectation of privacy , and (3) defendant’s conduct constituted a \nserious invasion of privacy.  Hill v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn., 865 P.2d 633, 654- 55, 26 \nCal.Rptr.2d 834, 7 Cal.4th 1 ( Cal. 1994) .   \nDefendants argue Vestrand  failed to plausibly  allege that she possess es a legally protected \nprivacy interest.  The California Constitution protects two separate classes of privacy interests:  (1) \ninformation privacy, which includes interests in precluding the dissemination or misuse of confidential and sensitive information; and (2) autonomy privacy, including interests in making \npersonal decisions or conducting personal activities without intrusion.  In re Google Location History Litig., 514 F.Supp.3d 1147, 1154 (N.D. Cal. 2021) .  Because autonomy privacy protects bodily \nautonomy, it does not apply under the circumstances.  Se e In re Yahoo Mail Litig ., 7 F.Supp.3d 1016, \n1039 (N.D. Cal. 2014) .  The Court therefore examines whether plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged the \nfirst class of privacy interests, information privacy.  \nVestrand has sufficiently alleged that the Clearview defendants’ conduct constituted a serious \ninvasion of he r information privacy  because b iometric information, by its very nature, is sensitive \nand confidential.  In addition, plaintiffs allege that the California Subclass had a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy to their highly sensitive biometrics  despite defendants’ argument that they \nhad no reasonable expectation of privacy over photographs  they uploaded to public websites .  \nAgain, the Clearview  defendants ignore that their conduct invades plaintiffs’ privacy in their \nbiometric information, n ot plaintiffs’ mere photographs.   Vestrand has therefore plausibly alleged \nher right to privacy claim under the California Constitution.   New York State Law Claim  \nIn Count Fourteen, plaintiff Aaron Hurvitz, on behalf of himself and others similarly \nsituated in the New York Subclass, brings  a claim under New York’s Civil Rights Act § 51.  The Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 20 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>21 \n purpose of § 51 is to protect individuals from the commerci al exploitation of their name or image.  \nSee Kuklachev v. Gelfman , 600 F.Supp.2d 437, 474- 75 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) .  To establish liability under  § \n51, a plaintiff must show defendant’s nonconsensual use of his name, portrait, picture, or voice \nwithin the state of New York for purposes of advertising or trade.  See Electra v. 59 Murray Enter ., \nInc., 987 F.3d 233, 249 ( 2d Cir. 2021) .    \nThe Clearview defendants argue  Hurvitz has  not sufficiently alleged that his picture was used \nfor trade purposes.  New York “courts have defined use ‘for the purposes of trade’ as use which \n‘would draw trade to the firm’ or ‘use for the purpose of making profit.’”  Amusement Indus ., Inc. v. \nStern, 693 F.Supp.2d 301, 314 (S.D.N.Y. 2 010) (citation omitted ).  Plaintiffs have repeatedly alleged \nthe Clearview defendants developed technology to invade the privacy of the American public for \ntheir own profit.  Accordingly, the Court denies defendants’ motion to dismiss Count Fourteen.  \nUnjust Enrichment Clai m \nNext, t he Clearview def endants move to dismiss plaintiffs’ unjust enrichment claim alleged \nin Count Fifteen of the first amended consolidated class action complaint.  In particular,  defendants \nargue that unjust enrichment is not a viable, stand- alone claim under Illinois, Virgin ia, California, or \nNew York law.  Under Illinois law, unjust enrichment “ is not a separate cause of action that, \nstanding alone, would justify an action for recovery.”  Toushin v. Ruggiero , 2021 IL App (1st) 192171, \n¶ 80, 2021 WL 2718495, at *13 ( 1st Dist.  2021) (quoting  Mulligan v. QVC, Inc., 888 N.E.2d 1190, \n1200, 321 Ill.Dec. 257, 267, 382 Ill.App.3d 620, 631 ( 1st Dist.  2008) .  Rather, unjust enrichment is a \ncondition resulting from unlawful or improper conduct like fraud and may be redressed by a ca use \nof action based upon that improper conduct.  Toushin , 2021 IL App (1st) 192171, ¶ 80.   “[I]f an \nunjust enrichment claim rests on the same improper conduct alleged in another claim, then the \nunjust enrichment claim will be tied to this related claim —and, of course, unjust enrichment will \nstand or  fall with the related claim .”  Cleary v. Philip Morris Inc ., 656 F.3d 511, 517 ( 7th Cir. 2011) .  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 21 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>22 \n Because plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged their BIPA claims, the Court denies defendants’  motion \nto dismiss the unjust enrichment claim attendant to the BIPA claims.  \nUnder Virginia law, a claim of unjust enrichment requires  a showing that the defendant \nreceived benefits of which the defendant was aware and that the defendant accepted or retained the \nbenefit without paying for its value.  Fessler v. IBM Corp.,  959 F.3d 146, 157 ( 4th Cir. 2020).  Because \nplaintiffs have adequately that the Clearview defendants used the benefit of their biometric data \nwithout paying them for its value, the Court denies the Clearview defendants’ motion to dismiss the Virginia unjust enrichment claim.  \nThe Ninth Circuit has explained that a California common law  unjust enrichment claim may \nsurvive either “as an independent cause of action or as a quasi -contract claim for restitution.”   ESG \nCapital Partners, LP v. Stratos , 828 F.3d 1023, 1038 ( 9th Cir. 2016) ; see also Hart v. TWC Product & Tech. \nLLC , 526 F.Supp.3d 592, 604 (N.D. Cal. 2021) .  “To allege unjust enrichment as an independent \ncause of action, a plaintiff must show that the defendant received and unjustly retained a benefit at \nthe plaintiff’s expense.”  ESG Capital Partners, 828 F.3d at 1028.  P laintiffs have sufficiently alleged \ndefendants were unjustly enriched by  the use of their biometric information without their  consent.  \nThe Clearview defendants, however, correctly assert  plaintiffs’ New York common law \nunjust enrichment claim s are preempted by New York Civil Rights Act §§ 50, 51.  See Sondik v \nKimmel, 131 A.D. 3d 1041, 1042, 16 N.Y.S.3d 296, 298 (N.Y. App. Div. 2015)  (“Common -\nlaw unjust  enrichment  claims for the unauthorized use of an image or likeness are preempted \nby Civil Rights  Law  §§ 50 and  51.”); Myskina v. Conde Nast Publications, Inc. , 386 F.Supp.2d 409, 420 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2005) ( same).  The Court grants this  aspect of defendants’  motion to dismiss.   \n  Declaratory Judgment Claim  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 22 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>23 \n \n On a final note, because defendants’ argument for dismissing plaintiffs’ declaratory and \ninjunctive relief claim in Count  Sixteen is solely based on plaintiffs’ failure to state a claim , the Court \ndenies defendants’ motion to dismiss  this count . \n \nConclusion  \nThe Court grants in part and denies in part defendants’ motion to dismiss  [87]. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDate:  2/14/2022     Entered: _____________________________ \n         SHARON JOHNSON COLEMAN \n         United States District Judg e Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 279 Filed: 02/14/22 Page 23 of 23 PageID #:<pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: The court denied Peloton Interactive, Inc.'s motion to dismiss a class action lawsuit alleging violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The plaintiffs contend that Peloton’s website chat feature, with embedded software from Drift, intercepted and recorded communications without user consent to enhance Drift's AI technologies. The court found that the plaintiff sufficiently alleged that Drift acted as a third-party eavesdropper for its purposes, thus contravening the privacy law.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Peloton and its third-party software provider, Drift, violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act by intercepting and utilizing user chat data without consent, thereby acting as a third-party eavesdropper.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the plaintiff presented a plausible claim under Section 631(a) of CIPA, sufficient to overcome a motion to dismiss, by alleging that Drift intercepted communications for its own benefit, thus acting as a third-party eavesdropper.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're texting your friend, and you think it's just the two of you chatting. But secretly, a third person reads your messages and uses them to get better at their job. In this lawsuit, Peloton's website chats were allegedly getting spied on by a third-party software that took your conversations and used them to make its AI better. This is like someone peeking at your chat without telling you, and the court thinks that's not okay under California law.",

[ECF No. 20 .] The Court decides the matter on the papers submitted and \nwithout oral argument.  See Civ. L. R. 7.1(d.1).  For the reasons stated below, the Court  \ndenies the Motion to Dismiss.  \nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND1 \nPlaintiff brings this putative class action against Peloton as the owner and operator \nof the website https://www.onepeloton.com  (“Website”)  for violations of the California \nInvasion of Privacy Act, Cal. Penal Code § 631(a), Clause Four. (First Amended \n \n1 The facts are taken from the Complaint.  Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 1 of 9 \n   2 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Complaint “FAC” at 11). Plaintiff’s claim arise s from Defendant’s use of the third- party \nsoftware called Drift which was embedded into the Website chat feature. Chat \ncommunications with the Website ar e automatically intercepted and record ed by Drift  \nwhich creates transcripts of the conversations. Drift receives the communications while \nthey are  in transit because the imbedded code routes the communications directly to Drift. \nWebsite users are not informed that Drift is intercepting the communications but instead \nconsumers believe they are interacting only with a Peloton representative. Drift allegedly \nharvests data from the chat transcripts it intercepts,  and then interprets, analyzes, stores, \nand uses the data for a variety purposes . Information collected includes the full transcript \nof the conversation, the date and time the conversation began, the IP address of the \nvisitor, the web browser they used to access the Website, the devi ce used and which \nwords triggered the Drift software to rout e the visitor to a particular Peloton \nrepresentative. According to Plaintiff, visitors to the Website often share personal \ninformation on the chat due to the nature of Peloton’s business. Plaintiff and other class \nmembers visited the Website within the class period using smart phones, and/or wifi -\nenabled tablets and laptops.  \nII. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  \nOn June 9, 2023 , Plaintiff filed a Complaint asserting  violations of CIPA , the UCL \nand California Constitution in relation to the unauthorized interception,  collection, \nrecording, and dissemination of Plaintiff’s and Class Members’ communications and \ndata. [ECF No. 1.]  On August 16, 2023, Defendant a motion to dismiss which the Court \ngranted on March 12, 2024. [ECF No. 18.] Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint \ncontaining a single CIPA Section 631(a) claim on March 15, 2024. [ECF No. 19.] On \nMarch 29, 2024, Defendant filed the present Motion to Dismiss the First Amended \nComplaint. [ECF No. 20.] On April 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a response in Opposition. \n[ECF No. 21.] On April 22, 2024, Defendant filed a Reply. [ECF No. 22.]  \n// \n// Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 2 of 9 \n   3 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 III. DISCUSSION  \nDefendant seeks dismissal of this action pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.  \nA. Failure to State a Claim  \nA 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of the  complaint. Navarro v. \nBlock, 250 F.3d 729, 732 (9th Cir.  2001). A pleading must contain, in part, “a short and \nplain  statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to  relief.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n8(a)(2). But plaintiffs must also plead “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is \nplausible on  its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007); see also \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The plausibility standard demands more than “a formulaic \nrecitation of the  elements of a cause of action,” or “‘naked assertions’ devoid of ‘further \nfactual enhancement.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly , \n550 U.S. at  557). Instead, the complaint “must contain allegations of underlying facts \nsufficient to give fair notice and to enable the  opposing party to defend itself effectively.” \nStarr v. Baca , 652 F.3d 1202, 1216 (9th Cir. 2011).  \nIn reviewing a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, “[a]ll allegations of material fact are \ntaken as true and construed in the light  most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Cahill v. \nLiberty  Mut. Ins. Co. , 80 F.3d 336, 337 –38 (9th Cir. 1996). However,  a court need not \ntake legal conclusions as true merely because they are cast in the form of factual \nallegations. See Roberts v. Corrothers, 812 F.2d 1173, 1177 (9th Cir. 1987). Similarly,  \n “conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences  are not sufficient to defeat a \nmotion to dismiss.” Pareto v.  FDIC , 139 F.3d 696, 699 (9th Cir. 1998).   \n1. Violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act, Cal Penal Code § 631 \nSection 631(a) of the California Penal Code imposes civil and criminal liability on \n“any person who by means of any machine, instrument, or contrivance, or in any other \nmanner : \n[1] intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection, whether \nphysically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 3 of 9 \n   4 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable, or instrument, including the wire, \nline, cable, or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, \nor \n[2] who willfully and without the consent of all parties to the \ncommunication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, \nor to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report, or \ncommunication while the same is in transit or passing o ver any wire, line, or \ncable, or is being sent from, or received at any place within this state; or \n[3] who uses, or attempts to use, in any manner, or for any purpose, or to \ncommunicate in any way, any information so obtained, or \n[4] who aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons \nto unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any of the acts or things \nmentioned above in this section[.] \nCal. Penal Code § 631(a)(subsections added and formatted for clarity).  \nThe California Supreme Court has explained that Section 631(a) consists of three \nmain clauses which cover “three distinct and mutually independent patterns of conduct”: \n(1) “intentional wiretapping,” (2) “willfully attempting to learn the contents or meaning \nof a communication in transit over a wire,” and (3) “attempting to use or communicate \ninformation obtai ned as a result of engaging in either of the two previous activities.” \nTavernetti v. Superior Court , 22 Cal. 3d 187, 192 (1978). The fourth basis for liability in \nSection 631(a) imposes liability for aiding and abetting on any person or persons who  \n“unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any of the’ other three bases for liability. ” \nMastel v. Miniclip SA , 549 F.Supp.3d 1129, 1134 (E.D. Cal. 2021) (quoting Cal. Penal \nCode § 631(a)) .  \nIn the FAC , Plaintiff alleges that Peloton “aids and abets Drift to commit both \nunlawful interception [Clause Two] and unlawful use [Clause Three] under Section 631(a), surreptitiously and as a matter of course.” (FAC  ¶ 41). Plaintiff makes no \nallegations regarding Clause One.  \n// \n// Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 4 of 9 \n   5 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 a. Section 631(a) Clause Two-  Unlawful Interception  \nTo establish liability under the s econd clause of section 631(a), Plaintiff must \nallege that Drift  “willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or \nin any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or \nmeaning of any message .” Cal. Penal Code § 631(a). “[C]ourts have applied Section \n631(a) via the language of its second clause to the internet browsing context.” Williams  v. \nWhat If Holdings , 2022 WL 17869275, at *2 (N.D. Cal. 2022).  \nUnder this clause,  a person is liable if he or she secretly listens to another's \nconversation. Ribas v. Clark , 38 Cal. 3d 355, 359 (1985). Only a third party can \n“eavesdrop” on a conversation, therefore a party to the communication is exempt from liability under section 631. See In re Facebook, Inc. Internet Tracking Litig.,  956 F.3d \n589, 607 (9th Cir. 2020); Warden v. Kahn , 99 Cal.App.3d 805, 811 (Ct. App. 1979). \nThere is no definition for the term “party” in CIPA, therefore, courts have looked to the \ntechnical processes an d context of the interception when considering who qualifies as a \nthird -party eavesdropper.  Facebook , 956 F.3d at 607.   \nDefendant argues that the party exemption applies because Plaintiff ’s factual \nallegations  establish that Drift provides a tool that allows Peloton to record and analyze \nits own data in aid of its business which means it functions as an extension of Peloton \nrather than as a third- party eavesdropper. (Mot. at 9).   According to Peloton, Plaintiff’s \nclaim  that Drift is a third -party because it uses the intercepted data to improve its AI \nchatbot is insufficient to show that the data is aggregated, re -distributed or sold to other \nvendors as required to be considered a third- party eavesdropper. ( Id. at 7-8).  In addition, \nPlaintiff did not specifically allege that she interacted with Drift’s AI chat feature when \nshe allegedly visited the Website, but instead it appears her communications were \nintercepted by a traditional “rule -based” chatbot. (Id . at 8 -9).  \nIn response, Plaintiff argues that Drift functions as a third -party eavesdropper \nbecause it uses  the intercepted data for its own purposes including to improve the \ntechnological function and capabilities of its patented AI software assets for the exclusive Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 5 of 9 \n   6 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 purpose of increasing the value of Drift’s shareholders equity in the company.  (Oppo. at \n4).  According to Plaintiff, t hese uses go “beyond simply supplying this information back \nto Defendant,” making Drift a third -party . (Id. at 5).  Plaintiff argues it is immaterial \nwhether Plaintiff alleged she used the AI chatbot because the FAC alleges that Drift uses \nall chat conversations, not just those intercepted from the AI chatbots, to improve its \nSaaS platform . (Id.) \nTo answer the question whether a service provider like Drift is more akin to a party \nor a third -party eavesdropper for purposes of the party exception, courts look to the \n“technical context of the case.” Facebook , 956 F.3d at 607. Two lines of district court \ncases have emerged in California addressing whether the party exemption can apply to \nsoftware providers. See Javier v. Assurance, 649 F.Supp.3d 891, 899- 901 (N.D. Cal. \n2023) (discussing two lines of cases).  \nIn the first line of cases, a software provider can be h eld liable under the second \nprong of section 631(a) if that entity  listens in on a conversation between the participants, \neven if one of the participants consents to the additional party’s presence , and the entity \nuses the collected data for its own commercial purposes . Ribas, 38 Cal. 3d at 361-62. For \ninstance, an independent party that captures data from a hosting website to sell to \nadvertisers to generate revenue has been considered an eavesdropper. Facebook , 956 F.3d \nat 607- 608 (Facebook used embedded software to track  its users to third -party websites \neven when its users were not signed into Facebook, and then sold that data to \nadvertisers) ; see also Revitch v. New Moosejaw , 2019 WL 5485330, * 2 (N.D. Cal. 2019 ) \n(marketing company and data broker NaviStone operated as a third party because they \nused intercepted data to “create marketing databases of identified website visitors ” and \nsold the information. ) \nIn the second line of cases, i f the s oftware provider merely collects, refines, and \nrelays the information obtained on the company website back to the company “in aid of \n[defendant’s] business” then it functions as a tool and not as a third- party.  Graham v. \nNoom , 533 F.Supp.3d 831, 832 -833 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 8, 2021 ) (tracking service provider Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 6 of 9 \n   7 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 was a participant in the conversation under § 631(a) because that defendant only stored \nuser’s data and did not use or resell that data).   \nSome district courts have cautioned against considering the use  a technical partner \nmakes of the data, finding that doing so reads  a use requirement into the s econd clause \nand usurps  the use inquiry that is contained in the t hird clause.  Javier , 649 F.Supp.3d at \n900 (“reading a use requirement into the second prong would add requirements that are \nnot present (and swallow the third prong in the process)). ” However, the inquiry focuses \non the technical processes by which the data is gathered  and manipulated, a question \nwhich  is often intertwined with the use of that data. Noom , 533 F.Supp.3d at 832.  \nTherefore , the Court considers the technical  aspect along with the use made by Drift of \nthe surreptitiously gathered information.  \nIn the FAC, Plaintiff describes the technical manner in which Drift accesses \ncustomer’s information and explains:   \nChat communications on the Website are intercepted by Drift while those \ncommunications are in transit, and this is accomplished because the \nimbedded code directs those communications to be routed directly to Drift. \nDrift’s chat service is an Application Programming Interface (API) that is \n“plugged into” the Website. The chat function is run from Drift’s servers but \nallows for chat functionality on the Website. In other words, Drift runs the \nchat service from its own servers, but consumers interact with the chat \nservice on Defendant’s Website, so it appears they are only communicating \nwith a company representative of Defendant.  \n(FAC ¶ 13).  \nAfter accessing customers’ communications in this manner,  \n. . . Drift analyzes and uses the chat conversations it intercepts and records to, inter alia , improve its SaaS platform, including proprietary machine \nlearning for its chatbots and related technologies, all of which independently benefits and serves the profit- driven equity interests of Drift’s shareholders . \nIn other words, Drift uses the content of the conversations that Plaintiff and  \nClass  Members  have  with Defendant —without Plaintiff’s or Class \nMembers’ consent —to improve the technological function and capabilities \nof its proprietary, patented artificial  intelligence software assets for the Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 7 of 9 \n   8 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 exclusive purpose and benefit of increasing the value of Drift shareholders’ \nequity in the company and its technologies.  \n(FAC. ¶ 17)(emphasis in original).  \nThe FAC alleges , “Drift’s exploitation, modernization, use of, and interaction with \nthe data it gathers through the chat feature in real time makes it more than a mere \n‘extension’ of Defendant .” (FAC ¶ 19).   \nTaking t hese allegations as true for purposes of the present motion, the Court finds \nPlaintiff has sufficiently allege d that Drift’s software surreptitiously intercepts the data \nentered by Peloton’s customers through the embedded API and uses “the data for their \nown benefit and not for the sole benefit of the party to the communication [Peloton], ” \ntherefore Drift functions as a third- party eavesdropper within the meaning of section \n631(a). Javier , 649 F.Supp.3d at 899; Esparza v. UAG Escondido AI Inc ., 2024 WL \n559241, at *7 (S.D. Cal. 2024) (allegations that a chat service provider “profit[s] from \nsecretly exploiting ” the ability to identify individuals who visited Defendant's website  led \nto a plausible inference that the chat service provider is using the information for its own \npurposes .) For these reasons, the Court finds that the party exemption does not apply and \nPlaintiff has sufficiently stated a claim under c lause two of § 631(a). Accordingly, \nDefendant’s motion to dismiss  is denied  on this ground.   \n(b) Section 631(a) Clause Three “Use” Claim  and C lause Fo ur “Aiding and \nAbetting ” \nMaintaining  a claim under the t hird clause of § 631 requires “ attempting to use or \ncommunicate information obtained as a result of engaging in either of the two previous \nactivities ” i.e. intentional wiretapping (c lause one) or willfully attempting to learn the \ncontents of a communication in transit over a wire ( clause two). Tavernetti, 22 Cal. 3d at \n192.  As noted above, Plaintiff  has sufficiently alleged a claim under c lause two because \nshe asserts that Drift uses intercepted communications to improve its SaaS platform, \nincluding its proprietary machine lea rning software, which yields a monetary benefit to Case 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 8 of 9 \n   9 \n23-cv-1082 -L-BGS 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 Drift .  In response, Defendant argues only that Plaintiff fails to state claim for c lause one \nor two, therefore her claim under c lause three also fails.  \nPlaintiff has stated a claim under c lause three of Section 631 because she has \nmaintained a claim under clause two . Cahill, 80 F.3d at 337– 38 (9th Cir. 1996).  For the \nsame reasons, Plaintiff asserts a plausible claim for relief under c lause four for aiding and \nabetting . Cal Penal Code § 631(a). In light of the above, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is \ndenied as to these claims.  \nA. Injunctive Relief  \nPlaintiff has chosen to withdraw her claim for injunctive relief (Oppo. at 13), \ntherefore, the Court dismisses the injunctive relief claim with prejudice.  Hipschman v. \nCnty. Of San Diego, No. 22 -CV-00903, 2023 WL 5734907, at * 9 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 5, \n2023) (dismissing abandoned claim without leave to amend). Defendant’s motion to \ndismiss is denied as moot to this claim.  \nIV. CONCLUSION AND ORDER   \nFor the forgoing reasons, Defendant’s motion to dismiss is DENIED.  \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDated:  July 5, 2024   \n \nCase 3:23-cv-01082-L-DTF   Document 24   Filed 07/05/24   PageID.<pageID>   Page 9 of 9",

Some of these people want to keep their names secret because they fear being embarrassed if their identities are revealed. The court said that if these people want to be the leaders representing all affected website users, they have to reveal their true names, but if they want to stay in the background and just be part of the group without leading, they can keep their names secret.",

Plaintiffs in these actions allege, \non behalf of similar putative nationwide or state classes, that Avid failed to adequately secure \ntheir personal and financial information; marketed a “Full Delete Removal” service that did not, \nin fact, purge user  account information from the Ashley Madison database; and made extensive \nuse of artificial intelligence “bots” and other mechanisms to mimic fake users (specifically, \nfemale users) on the Ashley Madison website in order to induce actual (predominantly mal e) \nusers to make purchases.  \nFollowing an initial status conference with counsel on January 26, 2015, Plaintiffs were \nordered to file any Motion for Leave to Proceed Under Pseudonyms by February 15, 2016. (Doc. \nNo. 75) The Court also ordered the parties to  file, if necessary , an agreed upon limited protective \norder concerning the disclosure of the Doe Plaintiffs ’ identities pending the Court’s ruling on Case: 4:15-md-02669-JAR   Doc. #:  138   Filed: 04/06/16   Page: 1 of 9 PageID #: <pageID> \n2 \n Plaintiffs’ motion to proceed under pseudonyms no later than February 15, 2016. ( Id.) On the \nparties’ con sent motion, the Court entered the parties’ agreed upon limited protective order on \nFebruary 16, 2016. (Doc. No. 93)  \nThis matter is now before the Court on Plaintiffs’ fully briefed Motion for Leave to \nProceed Under Pseudonyms. (Doc. No. 91) Forty -two Plaintiffs1 seeking to represent a class of \nusers of the Ashley Madison website  have filed under pseudonym “to reduce the risk of \npotentially catastrophic personal and professional consequences that could befall them and their \nfamilies” should they be publicly  identified as someone whose sensitive personal information, \ni.e., names, email addresses, credit card information, and sexual preferences and habits, was \ncontained in Avid’s “cheating website” database. (Doc. No. 91 at ¶ 1; Doc. No. 92 at 1) Avid \nopposes Plaintiffs ’ motion  on the grounds that anonymous lawsuits are not permitted except in \nrare and exceptional circumstances, none of which apply here. (Doc. No. 109 at 3 -11) Avid \nfurther argues it will be significantly prejudiced if Plaintiffs are permitted t o proceed \nanonymously. ( Id. at 12 -14) Lastly, if the forty -two unnamed plaintiffs prefer to remain \nanonymous, they should do so as class members . (Id. at 14 -15) \nLegal standard  \nThe parties do not disagree on the overarching aspects of the law  governing the \ncircumstances under which a plaintiff may proceed under pseudonym . Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 10(a) g enerally  requires parties to a lawsuit to identify themselves in their respective \n                                                 \n1 John Doe v.

Frank , 951 F.2d 320, 322 (11 th Cir. 1992) (citing Southern Metho dist Univ. \nAss’n of Women L aw Students v. Wynne & Jaffe , 599 F.2d 707, 712 (5 th Cir. 1979)). The \npublic has a First Amendment right to access judicial proceedings, and that right includes the \nidentity of the parties  to litigation . Chambliss v . Liberty Life Assur.

Indeed, w hen a plaintiff commences an action in federal court, \nhe “invites public scrutin y of the dispute and the proceeding.” Id. \nThe decision to allow pseudonyms is within a court’s discretion. W.G.A. v. Priority \nPharmacy, Inc. , 184 F.R.D. 616, 617 (E.D. Mo. 1999). Neither the Eighth Circuit nor the \nSupreme Court has addressed the issue of when a pseudonym may be used ; however, m any \nfederal courts of appeal and numerous district courts have reached this issue . Roe v. St. Louis \nUniversity , No. 4:08 -CV-1474 -JCH, 2009 WL 910738, at *3 (E.D. Mo. Apr. 2, 2009) (citing \ncases). These courts have held  that a totality -of-the-circumstances balancing test must be used \nwhen deciding whether a party can sue under a pseudonym; in other words, the court must \nascertain whether the plaintiff “has a substantial privacy right which outweighs the customary \nconstit utionally -embedded presumption of openness in judicial proceedings.”  Id. (quoting Frank , \n951 F.2d at 323 (internal quotations and citation omitted )). The courts have identified several \nfactors common to cases in which a plaintiff has been permitted to proc eed under a fictitious \nname, including “(1) where the plaintiff is challenging government activity; (2) where the \nplaintiff is required to disclose information of the utmost intimacy; and (3) where the plaintiff \nrisks criminal prosecution through the infor mation contained in the pleading.”  Id.

Courts have generally allowed \nplaintiffs to litigate under pseudonym in cases involving allegations of sexual abuse and assault  \nbecause they concern highly sensitive and personal subjects.  See e.g., St. Louis University , 2009 \nWL 910738 (allowing rape victim to use a pseudonym because her privacy interest outweighed \nthe public’s right to access judicial records); Doe v.

(Doc. No. 92 at 5) In support of their assertion, Plaintiffs submit articles from \nnewspapers and other public sou rces reporting attempts to extort Ashley Madison users whose \nidentities ha ve been leaked , as well as suicides linked to the data breach. ( See Doc. Nos. 91 -1, -2, \n-3, -4) \nIn its response, Avid notes that a number of Plaintiffs who have filed similar class a ction \ncomplaints are using their real names,2 which  weakens  the argument Plaintiffs are asserting in \ntheir motion. Avid argues that Plaintiffs’ sexual preferences and habits do not constitute \ninformation of the utmost intimacy so as to require anonymity  and cites several cases  which hold \nthat potential embarrassment and economic harm are not enough to outweigh the public interest \nin open court proceedings.

Moreover, the personal and financial \ninformation Plaintiffs seek to protect has already been r eleased on the internet and made \navailable to the public . (Doc. No. 109 at 6 -7) \nIn further response, Avid argues it will be significantly prejudiced if Plaintiffs are \nallowed to proceed anonymously , both in terms of adverse publicity and its ability to con duct \ndiscovery . (Doc. No. 109 at 12 -14) However, Plaintiffs have disclosed their real names to Avid \npursuant to the parties’ agreed upon limited protective order. A similar limited protective order \ncan be used to protect other sensitive information as the case proceeds. Thus, the Court finds \nAvid’s ability to conduct discovery or mount a defense will not be impa ired. Roe v. Catholic \nHealth Initiatives Colorado , No. 11 -CV-02179 -WYD -KMT, 2012 WL 12840, at *5 (D. Colo. \nJan. 4, 2012).   \nPlaintiffs’ privacy interests are not as pronounced as those in th e cases discussed above . \nNevertheless, the Court finds t he possibl e injury to Plaintiffs rises above the level of mere \nembarrassment or harm to reputation  and weighs against public disclosure. Under the  facts  Case: 4:15-md-02669-JAR   Doc. #:  138   Filed: 04/06/16   Page: 6 of 9 PageID #: <pageID> \n7 \n alleged , it appears this may be a case where the  “injury litigated against would be incurred as a \nresult of the d isclosure of the plaintiff's identity.”  M.M. v. Zavaras , 139 F.3d 798, 803 (10th Cir. \n1998) . The disclosure of Plaintiffs ’ identities could expose their sensitive personal  and financial \ninformation - information  stolen from Avid when its computer systems w ere hacked - to public \nscrutiny and exacerbate the privacy violations underlying their lawsuit.   \nAt the same time,  there is a compelling public interest in open court proceedings, \nparticularly in the context of a class action, where a plaintiff seeks to re present a class of \nconsumers who have a personal stake in the case and a heightened interest in knowing who \npurports to represent their interests in the litigation. See Michael v. Bloomberg L.P. , No. 14 -CV-\n2657 (TPG), 2015 WL 585592 (S.D. N.Y. Feb. 11, 201 5), where the court rejected an FLSA  \nplaintiff’s request to proceed under pseudonym  on behalf of himself and others similarly \nsituated , finding his possible interest in anonymity was outweighed by the public’s interest in \ndisclosure . Although the plaintiff  offered to disclose his true identity to Bloomberg under seal, \nthe court found this arrangement “still runs against the public’s traditional right of access to \njudicial proceedings, and may also preclude potential class members from properly evaluating \nthe qualifications of the class representative.” Id. at *4.  \nThe Court has balanced Plaintiffs ’ interest in anonymity against any potential prejudice to \nAvid and the public’s interest in disclosure . The Court finds the possible injury to Plaintiffs  \nresulting  from public disclosure of their identities rises above the level of mere embarrassment or \nharm to reputation.  With respect to any prejud ice to Avid , the Court notes that Plaintiffs have \nalready agreed to provide Avid with their names subject to a protecti ve order, thereby alleviating \na barrier to defending the case.  \nThe Court has also considered the fact that these Plaintiffs are seeking to represent a \nputative class of users of the Ashley Madison website. There are significant differences between Case: 4:15-md-02669-JAR   Doc. #:  138   Filed: 04/06/16   Page: 7 of 9 PageID #: <pageID> \n8 \n the role s of class r epresentative and class member. Because class actions determine the rights of \nabsent  class members, due process requires the class be fairly and adequately represented. See \nRattray v. Woodbury Ct., IA , 614 F.3d 831, 835 (8th Cir. 2010);  Paxton v. Un ion Nat. Bank , 688 \nF.2d 552, 562 -63 (8 th Cir. 1982) ; Fed. R. Civ. P . 23(a)(4) . “The focus of Rule 23(a)(4) is \nwhether: (1) the class representatives have common interests with the members of the class, and \n(2) whether the class representatives will vigorou sly prosecute the interests of the class through \nqualified counsel. ” Paxton , 688 F.2d at 562-63. See also  Golan v. Veritas Entertainment, LLC , \n788 F.3d 814, 822 (8 th Cir. 2015).  Class representatives have a fiduciary obligation to fairly \nrepresent the enti re class, In re BankAmerica Corp. Securities Litigation , 775 F.3d 1060, 1062 n. \n1 (8th Cir. 2015) and Reynolds v. National Football League , 584 F.2d 280, 284 n.6 (8 th Cir. \n1978), and generally receive an incentive award as compensation for work done on beh alf of the \nclass.  Given the importance of the role of class representative, t he Court will require Plaintiffs to \ndisclose their identities so that the public, including the putative class members they seek to \nrepresent, know who is guiding and directing th e litigation. Because class members are not \ntypically testifying or offering evidence, they do not need to be specifically identified by name in \norder to be part of the litigation; they merely need to be identifiable.  \nBefore the consolidated complaint is f iled, Plaintiffs currently proceeding under \npseudonym who are seeking to serve as class representatives must decide whether to proceed \nusing their real names or dismiss their complaints and proceed, without public ly disclosing their \nnames, as class members – if and when a class is  certified.  The Court believes this balancing of \nthe equities does not deny a remedy to those Plaintiffs  wishing to remain anonymous.  Plaintiffs  \nreply that forcing some of them to drop their claims could leave a number of subclasses without \na named represe ntative. (Doc. No. 117 at 7) The possibility that subclasses might not be Case: 4:15-md-02669-JAR   Doc. #:  138   Filed: 04/06/16   Page: 8 of 9 PageID #: <pageID> \n9 \n \nrepresented is purely speculative at this stage of the proceedings. If this situation were to occur, \nthe Court can revisit its order.  \nAccordingly,  \nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED  that Plaintif fs’ Motion for Leave to Proceed under \nPseudonyms [91] is DENIED  in part in accordance with the rulings herein.  \n \nDated this  6th day of April , 2016 . \n         \n      ___________________________________                                                                 \n      JOHN A.

    "summary": "1. Summary: The court case involves a lawsuit against Clearview AI, Inc., and various municipal defendants for allegedly using Clearview's facial recognition database created from scraped online images without consent, violating privacy and free speech rights under the California Constitution. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state court, determining that the inclusion of nondiverse municipal defendants was appropriate and that they were not fraudulently joined to destroy diversity jurisdiction.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the addition of nondiverse municipal defendants warranted the remand of Clearview AI's case to state court under allegations of fraudulent joinder and the ensuing privacy and constitutional claims.\n\n3. Court's Holding: The court held that the plaintiffs had a reasonable possibility of succeeding with their claims against the nondiverse municipal defendants, thus justifying the remand of the case back to state court under 28 U.S.C. § 1447(e). The court rejected Clearview's arguments of fraudulent joinder and denied the request to sever claims against the municipal defendants.\n\n4. ELI5 Explanation: Imagine you sued a company you think wronged you using a fancy computer program that recognizes faces in photos, which you claim violates your privacy and free speech. This company wanted the case to be heard in federal court, claiming you only added certain other defendants (like towns) to avoid being in federal court due to different rules. The judge said your tactic was valid, the case should go back to state court, and the claims against those towns could potentially be successful, so you get to try your case there, which is what you wanted.",

(“Clearview”) removed the California state \ncourt action, R enderos v. Clearview AI, Inc. , to the Northern District of California  asserting that plaintiffs \nhad fraudulently joined certain def endants to destroy diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.   The judicial \npanel for multidistrict litigation transferred Renderos  to this Court on October 5, 2021, after denying the  \nRenderos plaintiffs’ motion to vacate an earlier conditional transfer order.  Before the Court is the \nRenderos  plaintiffs’ motion to remand under 28 U.S.C. §  1447(c).  For the following reasons, the Court  \ngrants plaintiffs’ motion.  \nBackgroun d \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its prior rulings in this multidistrict litigation .  In their April \n22, 2021 complaint filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, Alameda County, plaintiffs allege that they are two community -based organizations and f our political activists.  They seek \ninjunctive relief and damages against  defendant Clearview  based on allegations that Clearview i llegally \nacquir ed, stor ed, and s old their likenesses, and the likenesses of millions of Californians via Clearview’s \nsearchable facial recognition database.  Plaintiffs a ssert that Clearview scraped billions of photographs  \nfrom websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Venmo and used artificial intelligence algorithms to scan the faceprints.  Thereafter, Clearview created a searchable database containing plaintiffs’ faceprints  allow ing \nusers , including law enforcement agencies,  to identify unknown individuals  by uploading a photograph.  \nPlaintiff s bring claims under California common law, the California Constitution, and California’s \nUnfair Competition Law.\n   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 1 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Clearview is not the only defendant to this lawsuit.  Plaintiffs originally filed their  state court \naction against Clearview as the sole def endant , after which Clearview removed the lawsuit to federal \ncourt based on diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs then dismissed their a ction and filed a \nnew state court complaint , which is the operative complaint,  adding nondiverse  California municipal \ndefendants , City of El Segundo, City and County of Alameda, and City of Antioch.   As such, plaintiffs \nadded the municipal defendants before Clearview removed the operative complaint t o federal court.  \nLegal Standard1 \n“A plaintiff typically may choose its own forum, but it may not join a nondiverse defendant \nsimply to destroy diversity jurisdiction.”  Schur v. L.A. Weight Loss Centers, Inc., 577 F.3d 752, 763- 64 (7th \nCir. 2009) .  The fraudulent joinder doctrine is “ desig ned to ‘strike a reasonable balance among the \npolicies to permit plaintiffs the tactical prerogatives to select the forum and the defendants they wish to \nsue, but not to reward abusive pleading by plaintiffs, and to protect the defendants ’ statutory right to \nremove.’”  Morris v. Nuzzo, 718 F.3d 660, 666 ( 7th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted).  The doctrine  permits \ndistrict court s “to disregard the citizenship of certain nondiverse defendants, assume jurisdiction over a \ncase, dismiss the nondive rse defendants, and thereby retain jurisdiction.’”   Schur,  577 F.3d at 763 \n(citation omitted).  To establish fraudulent  joinder , the moving  party  “bears a heavy burden to show \nthat, after resolving all issues of fact and law in favor of the non- moving party, the non- moving party \ncannot establish a cause of action” against the nondiverse defendants.  Thornton v. M7 Aerospace LP,  796 \nF.3d 757, 765 (7th  Cir. 2015).  This “heavy burden” standard “ is even more favorable to the plaintiff \nthan the standard that applies to a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).”  \nSchur , 577 F.3d at 764.  Under this standard, “ the district court must ask whether there is ‘any \n \n1 Under the plain language of 28 U.S.C. §  1447(e), b ecause plaintiffs joined the nondiverse municipal defendants \nbefore Clearview removed the present lawsuit to federal court, the fraudulent joinder standard § 1447(e) does not \napply.

March 7, 2019)  \n(“Section 1447 (e), which applies only to ‘additional defendant s’ that a plaintiff seeks to join ‘after removal,’ is \ninapplicable here because Plaintiff named Vista in his original complaint.”).  Clearview’s reliance on a D istrict \nCourt of Maryland case does not persuade the Court otherwise.

If \nplaintiffs have a reasonable possibility of  success  on even one of their claims against the municipal \ndefendants, the Court must count the nondiverse municipal defendants’ citizenship for jurisdictional \npurposes and remand this  case to state court.  See Smith v. Phillip Morris USA Inc., No. 18 C 6397, 2019 \nWL 4750119, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 2019) (Chang, J.).  F raudulent joinder , on the other hand,  bars \nreman d to state court .  Walton v. Bayer Corp ., 643 F.3d 994, 999 (7th Cir. 2011).     \nDiscussion  \nClearview and the m unicipal defendants first argue that  the Renderos  plaintiffs’ tort claims against \nthe municipal defendants necessarily fail because plaintiffs did not  present a claim of money damages to \nthe municipal defendants pursuant to California’s Tort Claims Act (“CTCA”) .  Indeed, under the \nCTCA, “ failure to timel y present a claim for money or damages to a public entity bars a plaintiff from \nfiling a lawsuit against that entity.”  Committee for Immigrant Rights of Sonoma County v. County of Sonoma,  644 \nF.Supp.2d 1177, 1205 (N.D. Cal. 2009).  The CTCA, however, does not apply “to nonpecuniary \nactions, such as those seeking  injunctive , specific or declaratory relief.”  Branciforte Heights, LLC v. City of \nSanta Cruz , 42 Cal.Rptr.3d 96, 107, 138 Cal.App.4th 914, 929 (Cal. 2006).  In their motion t o remand, \nplaintiffs maintain that they are only seeking injunctive relief  against the municipal defendants , \ntherefore, the CTCA does not apply under the circumstances.    \nNonetheless, plaintiffs  cannot bring claims against the municipal defendants under California’s \ncommon law tort of misappropriation of likeness because pursuant to California’s Government Code § \n815(a), “ there is no such thing as common law tort liability for public entities .”  Quigley v. Garden Valley \nFire Protection Dist., 444 P.3d 688, 691, 249 Cal.Rptr.3d 548, 551, 7 Cal.5th 798, 803 (Cal. 2019).  The \nCourt thus considers plaintiffs’ claims brought against the municipal defendants under the California \nConstitution.  See Garcia v. City of Merced , 637 F.Supp.2d 731, 746 (E.D. Cal. 2008) . \n The Court turns to Count V of the state court complaint, which is plaintiffs’ direct claim against \nthe municipal defendants, namely, that the municipal defendants violated the guarantee of  liberty of Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n speech (freedom of speech) under article I, §  2(a) of the California Constitution.   “Article I, section 2, \nsubdivision (a) declares, ‘ Every person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all \nsubjects, being responsible for the abuse of  this right.  A law may  not restrain or abridge liberty of \nspeech  or press. ’”  Delano Farms Co. v. California Table Grape Com ., 417 P.3d 699, 708–09, 233 Cal.Rptr.3d \n45, 56–57, 4 Cal.5th 1204, 1221 ( Cal. 2018) .   \nIn their complaint , the Renderos  plaintiffs allege that the municipal defendants ’ use of \nClearview’s database has a chilling effect on their right to speech and association.  In particular, \nplaintiffs allege that the municipal defendants’ ability to search the Clearview database and their \nresultant use of the information gleaned from t he database  can lead to retribution by  law enforcement \nagainst plaintiffs who criticize the police .  Plaintiffs allege that knowing law enforcement defendants \ncan investigate and identify them via the Clearview database makes them reluctant to speak public ly at a \nrally or attend a protest.   In sum, plaintiffs’ allegations concern the right to assemble and the unlawful \nprior restraint of future speech.    \n Accordingly , plaintiffs’ allegations  also fall under art. I, §  3(a) of the California Constitution, \nwhich provides:  “The people have the right to instruct their representatives , petition government for \nredress of grievances, and  assemble  freely  to consult for the common good.”   Although there is no \nprivate right of action for damages based on a violation of art. I, §  2(a) or § 3(a) of the California \nConstitution, a private party may bring a claim for injunctive or declaratory relief under § § 2(a) and 3(a) .  \nSee Julian v. Mission C mty. Hosp., 218 Cal.Rptr.3d 38, 66, 11 Cal.App.5th 360, 391 (Cal. 2017) .  As above, \nplaintiffs are only seeking injunctive relief against the municipal defendants  as to this claim .   \n In their California complaint , plaintiffs allege that by using the Clearview database in their \ninvestigatory activities, including intelligence gathering, the municipal defendants’ conduct chills their speech and right to a ssociation.  See White v. Davis , 533 P.2d 222, 227, 120 Cal.Rptr. 94, 99, 13 Cal.3d \n757, 766 (Cal. 1975)  (“The inherent legitimacy of the police ‘intelligence gathering’ function does not \ngrant the police the  unbridled power to pursue that function by any and all means .”).  And, the Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n “California Constitution is more protective of free speech rights than the federal Constitution, and \nCalifornia courts require ‘ extraordinary circumstances ’ before a  prior  restraint  may be imposed. ”  \nMolinaro v. Molinaro,  245 Cal.Rptr.3d 402, 408, 33 Cal.App.5th 824, 832 (Cal. 20 19).  Clearview \nnevertheless argues plaintiffs cannot succeed on their  liberty of speech claim by citing a case i n which \nthe California Court of Appeal, Second District, held the “ Constitution, section 2(a) cannot be read to \nsupport a cause of action for injunctive relief where an individual is seeking to be rehired by her \nemployer.”   McAllister v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 157 Cal.Rptr.3d 720, 735, 216 Cal.App.4th 1198, \n1217 (Cal. 2013) .  Clearly, McAllister  does not apply under the circumstance s. \nDefendants’  other arguments fail to meet their  “heavy burden”  that there is no “ reasonable \npossibility ” plaintiffs can establish their speech/right to assemble claim against the municipal \ndefendants.  See Thornton,  796 F.3d at 765.  For example, Clearview argues plaintiffs’ claims implicate \nthe First Amendment, and thus, the  Court should retain jurisdiction.  It is well -settled, however , that \nplaintiffs are the master of their own complaint.  See  Prairie Rivers Network v. Dynegy Midwest  Generation,  \nLLC , 2 F.4th 1002, 1012 ( 7th Cir. 2021) .  If plaintiffs wanted to bring a First Amendment claim  in \nfederal court , they could have, but rather they chose to bring their claims under the California \nConstitution.  See Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc.,  984 F.3d 1241, 1246 ( 7th Cir. 2021)  (plaintiffs “ may \nchoose to rely exclusively on state law and avoid f ederal -question jurisdiction. ”).  Similarly, the \nmunicipal defendants argue plaintiffs have not established Article III standing to be in federal court.  \nThis argument works in favor of remand because without Article III standing, the proper course of action is to remand this lawsuit to state court.  Id.  at 1249; Collier v. SP Plu s Corp. , 889 F.3d 894, 897 ( 7th \nCir. 2018) .  In the end, defendants have not met their “heavy burden” to show that there is no \nreasonable possibility that the Renderos  plaintiffs can prevail on their claim in Count V.  Therefore, the \nCourt grants plaintiff s’ motion to remand  on this basis.  See  Smith , 2019 WL 4750119, at *2 . \nNext, in  Count IV,  plaintiffs bring an aiding and abetting claim against the municipal \ndefendants based on Clearview’s alleged  invasion of privacy in violation of the California Constitution, Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n art. I,  §  1.  To establish their claim against Clearview, plaintiff s must show (1) they possess a legally \nprotected privacy interest, (2) they maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy, and (3) defendant ’s \nconduct constituted a serious invasion of privacy.    Hill v.  National  Collegiate  Athletic  Assn. , 865 P.2d 633, \n654-55, 26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 7 Cal.4th 1 (Cal. 1994) .  In the Court’s February 2022 motion to dismiss \nruling, the Court concluded that the California Subc lass had plausibly alleged a right to privacy claim \nunder the California Constitution against Clearview.   Specifically, the Court concluded that the named \nplaintiff sufficiently alleged Cle arview’s conduct constituted a serious  invasion of her privacy because \nbiometric information, by its very nature, is sensitive and confidential.  \nThe Court therefore examines the Renderos  plaintiffs’ allegations of aiding and abetting against \nthe municipal defendants.  U nder California law, a defendant can be held liable for aiding and abe tting \nwhere defendant knows the underlying conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives the original  \ntortfeasor substantial a ssistance or encouragement .  See Barrett v. Apple Inc. , 523 F .Supp.3d 1132, 1145 \n(N.D.  Cal. 2021) ; S&S Worldwide, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank , 509 F.Supp.3d 1154, 1165 (N.D. Cal. 2020) .  \nSpecifically, “ California law ‘necessarily’ requires that for aiding and abetting liability to attach, a \ndefendant [] made ‘a conscious decision to participate in tortious activity for the purpose of assisting \nanother in performing a wrongful act.’”   George v. eBay, Inc ., 286 Cal.Rptr.3d 492, 508, 71 Cal.App.5th \n620, 641 (Cal. 2021)  (citation omitted).    \n In their state court complaint , plaintiffs allege that Clearview interacted with the City of \nAlameda Police Department to obtain a Clearview database license.   They further allege that despite the \nCity of Alameda passing a  resolution concerning the use of facial recognition, police officers and other \nemploy ees of  the City of Alameda and Alameda County continued to use the Clearview database by \nuploading images to conduct  investigatory searches.  Also, p laintiffs contend that Clearview uploaded \nthese images and corresponding biometric information to its database for future searches .  They further \ncontend police officers employed by the City of El Segundo and the City of Antioch have used and \ncontinue to use the Clearview database in this manner and that Clearview uploaded these images to its Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 315 Filed: 03/23/22 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n database for future searches.   Plaintiffs maintain the municipal defendants knew Clearview’s conduct \nbreached a duty to plaintiffs and that the municipal defendants provided substantial assistance to \nClearview in its  unlawful conduct by subscribing to Clearview, paying for Clearview’s database, and/or \npromoting the use of the database to  their employees.   \n It is reasonable to infer from p laintiffs ’ alleg ations  that the  Alameda defendants made a \nconscious effort to continue using Clearview’s facial recognition database after the municipal ordinance \nwas passed.   This alone, however, does not come close to alleging th at the municipal de fendants made a \nconscious decision to participate in Clearview’s tortious activity in order to assist Clearview in \nperforming a wrongful act.   See George , 286 Cal.Rptr.3d at 508.   Meanwhile, p laintiffs’ remaining \nallegations do not link the municipal defendants to Clearview’s invasion of privacy , which i s based on \nthe sensitive and confidential nature of biometric information.   As such, defendants have met their \nburden that plaintiffs have no “ reasonable possibility ” of prevailing  on their aiding and abetting claim.   \n Last, i n the alternative, Clearview argues that the municipal defendants are misjoined in this \naction under Federal Rule of Civil Pr ocedure 20(a) and should be severed under Rule 21.  Clearview \nmaintains that “[e]ven if plaintiffs satisfy the requirements for permissive joinder under Rule 20 (a), the \ncourt has discretion to sever a party at any time [ ] if doing so will increase judicial economy and avoid \nprejudice to the litigants.”   Bozek v. Wal –Mart Stores, Inc. , No. 15- cv-10, 2015 WL 3818984, at *2 (N.D. \nIll. 2015) (Darrah, J.) (citation o mitted).  Here, Clearview does little to convince the Court that the \nRenderos  plaintiffs will not suffer prejudice if the Court were to exercise its discretion and sever the \nclaims against the municipal defendants from this lawsuit.  The Court denies Clear view’s request  to \nsever the municipal defendants . \nConclusion  \n For these reasons, t he Court  grants the Renderos  plaintiffs’ motion to remand under 28 U.S.C. § \n1447(e)  [192].  The Court denies the municipal defendants’ motions for a judicial determination of \nfraudulent joinder, but grants their motions to remand [192, 209, 210, 211].

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: William Naughton filed a class action lawsuit against Amazon, claiming the company collected biometric data, including facial geometry, from employees during wellness checks without consent, violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The court denied Amazon's motion to dismiss, finding the allegations sufficient to state a plausible claim under BIPA, which concerns privacy protections against unauthorized collection and distribution of biometric data. AI and associated technologies are central to the case, as Amazon's alleged use of facial recognition systems for biometric data collection is a primary issue.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Amazon violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act by collecting, possessing, and disclosing employees' biometric data without informed consent, a retention policy, or destruction guidelines.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denied Amazon's motion to dismiss, ruling that the plaintiff's allegations plausibly claim that Amazon collected and possessed biometric data in violation of BIPA, by requiring employees to undergo facial scans as a condition of employment and potentially disseminating this data without consent.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine your job asked you and everyone else to have their faces scanned every day before work, but they never asked if it was okay or told you how long they'd keep this information. A worker, named William, took this issue to court because it's against privacy rules in Illinois for companies to do this without permission. The court said, \"We need to look into this more,\" instead of stopping the case, because William's complaint about his privacy being invaded makes sense.",
    "full_text": "1 \n  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN DIVISION  \n \nWilliam Naughton , individually and on \nbehalf of all others similarly situated,  \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nv. \n Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com, \nLLC,  \n \nDefendant s.  \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \nCase No. 20-cv-6485  \n \n Judge Mary M. Rowland  \n   \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n Plaintiff William Naughton claims that, during the COVID -19 pandemic, his \nemployer, Defendant Amazon, required wellness checks as a condition to his entry \ninto the warehouse where he worked.  These wellness checks  included scans of \nNaughton’s  facial geometry —a type of sensitive biometric data.   Naughton, on behalf \nof himself and other putative class members,  claims that Amazon has taken this data \nwithout his consent  and has further disclosed the information to other parties in \nviolation of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).  Amazon has \nmoved to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  [36].  For the reasons explained below, this Court denies Amazon’s motion.   \nI. Background  \nDefendants Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com, LLC (collectively, Amazon) \noperate a leading multinational technology company specializing in e -commerce, \ncloud- based servicing, streaming, and artificial intelligence.  [33] ¶ 1.  The named Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 1 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Plaintiff, William Na ughton, worked for Amazon as a “Picker” from September to \nOctober 2020 at one of its fulfillment warehouses in Joliet, Illinois.  Id.  ¶ 2.   \nIn approximately June 2020, Amazon began requiring its workers  to provide \nscans of their facial geometry, and possi bly other biometric information, as part of a \nwellness check prior to being allowed to access the facility each day.  Id.  ¶ 4.  \nNaughton alleges, on information and belief, that Amazon uses facial recognition \ndevices and associated software at their fulfil lment centers and warehouse locations \nthroughout Illinois.  Id.  ¶ 6.  The facial recognition devices and associated software \ncollect and capture biometric identifiers including facial geometry, retinas, and irises.  \nId. ¶ 7.  Amazon also scans and records workers’ temperatures.  Id.   Naughton claims \nthat, as a result of Amazon’s conduct, he and the putative class members lost their \nrights to control the collection, use, and storage of their biometric identifiers and \ninformation.  Id. ¶ 9.  Naughton also claims he and the other class members “were \nexposed to ongoing, serious, and irreversible privacy risks.”  Id.    \nNaughton alleges that Amazon never informed him it was collecting, obtaining, \nor storing his biometric data; never develop ed or adhered to any publicly available \nretention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying Naughton’s biometric data; and never obtained Naughton’s consent for any disclosure or dissemination of \nhis biometric data to third parties.  Id.  ¶ 46.  Naughton has never seen, been made \naware of, or been able to find any biometric data retention policy,  nor does he know \nof any policies regarding whether Amazon will ever permanently delete his biometric \ndata.  Id.  ¶ 48.  Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 2 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n Naughton brings claims on behalf of himself and a class of people defined as: \n“All employees  who entered  Defendant’s  locations  in the State  of Illinois  who had \ntheir  facial  geometry  scans,  biometric  identifiers,  and/or biometric  information \ncollected,  captured,  received,  or otherwise obtained,  maintained,  stored,  disclosed, or  \ndisseminated by Defendant during the  applicable  statutory period.”   Id. ¶ 59.  His \nfirst amended complaint asserts claims for:  failing to institute, maintain, and adhere \nto publicly available retention schedule and destruction guidelines in violation of 740 \nIll. Comp. Stat. § 14/15(a) (Count I); failing to obtain informed written consent and release before collecting or obtaining  biometric identifiers or information in violation \nof 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. § 14/15(b) (Count II); and disclosing or disseminating biometric identifiers and information before obtaining consent in violation of 740 Ill. Comp. \nStat. § 14/15(d) (Count III).  \nAmazon has moved to dismiss the first amended complaint in full.  [36].  \nII. Legal Standard  \nA motion to dismiss tests the sufficiency of a counterclaim , not the merits of \nthe case.   Gunn v. Cont’l Cas. Co. , 968 F.3d 802, 806 (7th Cir. 2020).  To survive a \nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), the counterclaim “ must provide enough factual \ninformation to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face and raise a right to relief above the speculative level. ”  Haywood v. Massage Envy Franch ising, LLC , 887 \nF.3d 329, 333 (7th Cir. 2018) (quoting Camasta v. Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc. , 761 \nF.3d 732, 736 (7th Cir. 2014) ); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)  (requiring a complaint  \nto contain a  “short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 3 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n entitled to relief” ).  A court deciding a  Rule 12(b)(6) motion  accepts the well-pleaded \nfactual allegations  as true  and draws all permissible  inferences in the pleading \nparty’s  favor.   Degroot v. Client Servs., Inc. , 977 F.3d 656, 659 (7th Cir. 2020) .   \nDismissal for failure to state a claim is proper  “when the allegations in a \ncomplaint , however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to relief.”   Bell Atl. \nCorp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007) .  Deciding the plausibility of the claim is  \n“a context -specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial \nexperience and common sense.”   Bilek  v. Fed. Ins. Co., 8  F.4th 581, 586–87 (7th Cir. \n2021)  (quoting W. Bend Mut. Ins. Co. v. Schumacher, 844 F.3d 670, 676 (7th Cir. \n2016) ). \nIII. Analysis  \nA.  BIPA  \nThe Illinois General Assembly adopted the Biometric Information Privacy Act  \nin 2008 in response to increased commercial use of biometric data.  Cothron  v. White  \nCastle Sys.,  Inc., No. 20 -3202, --- F.4th ---, 2021 WL 5998537, at *1 (7th Cir. Dec. 20, \n2021) .  The Act protects a person’s privacy interests in his or her biometric ide ntifiers, \nincluding fingerprints, retina and iris scans, hand scans, and facial geometry ; it does \nso by regulating the collection use, retention, disclosure, and dissemination of \nbiometric identifiers, providing  a cause of action for persons “aggrieved” by  a \nstatutory  violation.  Fox v. Dakkota  Integrated  Sys.,  LLC, 980 F.3d 1146, 1148 (7th \nCir. 2020) ; see also  Bryant  v. Compass Grp. USA,  Inc., 958 F.3d 617, 620 (7th Cir. \n2020),  as amended  on denial  of reh’g  and reh’g  en banc (June 30, 2020).   A successful Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 4 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n plaintiff recovers the greater of actual damages or statutory damages of $1,000 for \neach negligent violation and $5,000 for each reckless or willful violation.  Cothron , \n2021 WL 5998537, at *1.  \nNaughton’s first amended complaint implicates  three BIPA sections.  Section \n15(a) requires private entities “in possession of biometric identifiers or biometric information” to “develop a written policy, made available to the public, establishing \na retention schedule and guidelines for perm anently destroying biometric identifiers \nand biometric information .”  740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(a).  Section 15(b) provides that \na private entity may not  “collect, capture, purchase, receive through trade, or \notherwise obtain” a person ’s biometric  data without first providing notice to and \nreceiving consent from the person .  Id. § 14/15(b).   And section 15(d) provides that a \nprivate entity may not “disclose, redisclose, or otherwise disseminate”  biometric  data \nwithout consent .  Id.  § 14/15(d).   \nB.  Sufficiency of Allegations  \nAmazon attacks the sufficiency of Naughton’s allegations on a variety of \ngrounds , but ultimately, none a re persuasive  under the Rule 12(b)(6) standard .1 \nFirst, Amazon argues that the FAC fails to plausibly state that Amazon \npurposely collected any data that could qualify as biometric data, thus dooming \nNaughton’s section 15(b) claim.  As discussed, section 15(b)  makes it unlawful to \n“collect, capture, purchase, receive through trade, or otherwise obtain” a \n \n1 Amazon disputes that it collect ed Biometric Data in the “wellness checks” it conducted on employees \nvia “thermal cameras ”. (Dkt. 32 at 9). At this stage , the Court is obligated to accept the facts as pled \nin the complaint as true. Ultimately Plaintiff will have the burden of proving this fact.  Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 5 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n person ’s biometric  data without his  or her  written consent.  Cothron , 2021 WL \n5998537, at *4 ( quoting  740 Ill. Comp. Stat.  14/15(b) ).  Amazon emphasizes that \ncourts in this district have interpreted section 15(b) to impose liability only if an \nentity takes, at a minimum, “an active step to collect, capture, purchase or otherwise \nobtain biometric data.”  Jacobs v. Hanwha Techwin Am., Inc. , No. 21 C 866, 2021 WL \n3172967, at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 27, 2021)  (emphasis added) ; see also Heard v. Becton, \nDickinson & Co. , 440 F. Supp. 3d 960, 966 (N.D. Ill. 2020)  (Heard I ).  Amazon  insists  \nthat Naughton has not plausibly alleged that is has taken any “active step” to collect \nhis biometric data , citing two cases from this district dismissing section 15(b) claims \nfor omitting such allegations.   [37] at  8.     \nThe cases upon which Amazon relies are distinguishable. In Namuwonge v. \nKronos, Inc. , the district held that the plaintiff failed to allege a plausible section \n15(b) claim against a third -party vendor (a timekeeping tracking company)  that \ncollected information based on plaintiff clocking in via her fin gerprints as required \nby her employer. 418 F. Supp. 3d 279, 286 (N.D. Ill. 2019) .  The court reasoned that \nthe complaint’s allegations made clear that it was the employer, not the vendor itself, that collected the biometric data.  Id.   To the contrary, in Heard v. Becton, Dickinson \n& Co. , the court originally dismissed a section 15(b) claim against a supplier of \nfingerprint equipment because the complaint did not explain how the supplier, as \nopposed to the employer, actively collected the biometric data.  440 F. Supp. 3d 960, \n967 (N.D. Ill. 2020)  (Heard I ). The plaintiff in  Heard  filed an amended complaint that \nthe court subsequently found stated a claim under section 15(b) by alleging that the Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 6 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n supplier of the fingerprint equipment “ extracts the unique features of that fingerprint  \nto create a user template, and then stores users’ biometric  information both on the \ndevice and in [its] servers. ” See Heard v. Becton, Dickinson & Co. , 524 F. Supp. 3d \n831, 841 (N.D. Ill. 2021)  (Heard II ).  \nIn contrast to Namuw onge and consistent with the reasoning of Heard II , the \nfirst amended complaint here asserts that Amazon collects the data for its own use.  \nThe allegations also state that Amazon has imposed this requirement on warehouse \nworkers like Plaintiff as a condition of their employment.  By asserting that  Amazon \nitself implemented the facial scans and re quired workers to submit to these scans as \na condition of work, Naughton plausibly alleges Amazon  took an “active step” in \ncollecting his biometric data.  See, e.g. , King v. PeopleNet Corp. , No. 21 CV 2774, 2021 \nWL 5006692, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2021)  (finding that a complaint adequately \nalleged a section 15(b) violation by asserting that the plaintiff did not known of or \nconsent to her employer’s collection of her fingerprints during a  mandatory  \nonboarding process) . \nSecond, Amazon argues that Naughton insufficiently pleads  Amazon’s \n“possession” of biometric data , thus failing to meet a central element of his section \n15(a) and (d) claims.  [37] at 10.  As Amazon correctly recognizes, these BIPA sections \napply only to a  private entity “in possession  of biometric identifiers or biometric \ninformation.”  740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(a), (d) (emphasis added).  Amazon contends \nthat Naughton has not adequately alleged that Amazon collected his biometric data \nand that this failur e also necessarily means that Amazon could not have possessed Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 7 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n his biometric data.  [37] at 10.  Again, this Court disagrees.  As explained above, by \nrequiring that Naughton submit to scans disclosing his facial geometry, Amazon has \ntaken the requisite “act ive step” in collecting , and thus also possessing,  the data.  \nBeyond that,  Naughton also specifically asserts that Amazon stores his biometric \ndata in a database.  [33] ¶ 44.  This plainly satisfies the “possession” requirement at \nthe pleadings stage.  \nFina lly, Amazon argues that because Naughton has failed to allege “collection” \nand “possession” of data, he has also failed to allege that Amazon disclosed any \nbiometric data in violation of section 15(d).  [37] at 10– 11.  For the same reasons as \nexplained abo ve, this Court rejects the notion that Naughton’s allegations fail to \nsatisfy the “collection” and “possession” requirements under the statute.  Amazon also \ncontends that Naughton’s section 15(d) falls short because although  he claims that \nAmazon disclosed his biometric data to third parties, he does not more fulsomely allege what data Amazon disclosed, when or where the disclosure occurred, or to \nwhom the disclosure occurred.  [37] at 11.   But Amazon seeks to impose a height ened \nstandard where there is none; all Naughton must plead is “ plausible dissemination.”   \nCothron  v. White  Castle Sys.,  Inc., 467 F. Supp. 3d 604, 618 (N.D. Ill. 2020) .  He has \ndone so here by indicating that Amazon has collected his facial geometry, discl osed \nthat data to “other Amazon entities” and to “third -party biometric device and software \nvendor(s)” and other possible third parties.  [33] ¶¶ 4, 34.  The law does not demand \nmore at the pleadings stage.   \nIV. Conclusion  Case: 1:20-cv-06485 Document #: 51 Filed: 01/03/22 Page 8 of 9 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n \nFor the reasons explained above,  this Court denies Amazon’s motion to dismiss \n[36]. Naughton’s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint to substitute \nnamed plaintiff [48] remains under advisement. The Court will not require Amazon \nto answer the first amended complaint until aft er ruling on the pending motion to \nsubstitute.  \n \n \nDated: January 3, 2022   \n \n \nE N T E R:  \n  \n \n MARY M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This case involves a class action lawsuit against Clearview AI, Inc., alleging that the company covertly scraped over three billion facial images from the internet and used AI algorithms to scan and extract biometric identifiers without consent, violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The court denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration concerning waived arguments related to personal jurisdiction, Article III standing, and BIPA's government-contractor exemption, while providing clarification on specific issues like the status of a defendant, Thomas Mulcaire, in the case.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the defendants waived their arguments regarding personal jurisdiction, government-contractor exemption under BIPA, and Article III standing, and whether the plaintiffs have adequately claimed violations under BIPA.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court denies the defendants' motion for reconsideration on the grounds that the defendants did not present sufficiently developed arguments earlier and waives any new arguments raised in the reconsideration motion. The court clarifies that Thomas Mulcaire remains a defendant in the lawsuit.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company took billions of online pictures secretly and used fancy computer programs to identify people's faces without asking for permission, breaking a law meant to protect people's faces as private information. People sued, and the company tried to argue that some parts of the lawsuit were not fair or had been wrongly decided. The court said, \"Sorry, you can't bring up these complaints now because you didn't speak up properly when you had the chance,\" but did clarify that one person they thought was out of the case is actually still in it.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN DIVISION  \n \n      ) \nIn re Clearview AI, Inc., Consumer Privacy  ) Case No. 21- cv-0135 \nLitigation,      )  \n      ) Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman  \n      ) \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \nOn February 14, 2022, the Court granted in part and denied in part the Clearview \ndefendants’  motion to dismiss  brought pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and \n12(b)(6) .  Before the Court is defendants’ motion for reconsideration and clarification under Rule \n54(b) .  For the following reasons, t he Court, in its discretion, denies defendants ’ motion for \nreconsideration and grants the motion for clarification.  The Court also denies defendants ’ request \nfor oral argument on their motion because it is unnecessary . \nBackground  \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its February 14, 2022 Memorandum, Opinion, and \nOrder, along with the Court’s other rulings in this multi -district litigation (“MDL”) , inclu ding the \nAugust 12, 2020 Memorandum, Opinion, and Order denying defendant s Hoan Ton- That’s and \nRichard Schwartz’s motion to dismiss  brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) for lack of personal \njurisdiction  in the first -filed lawsuit in this MDL, Mutnick v. Clear view, 20-cv-0512.  The Court also \npresumes familiarity with its January 27, 2022 motion to dismiss ruling in relation to retail defendant \nMacy’s and the March 18, 2022 ruling denying Macy’s motion to certify an interlocutory appeal \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b ). \nIn their first amended consolidated class action complaint, plaintiffs allege  the Clearview \ndefendants covertly scraped over three billion photographs of facial images from the internet and then used artificial intelligence algorithms to scan the face geometry of each individual depicted  to Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 1 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n harvest the individuals’ unique biometric identifiers and corresponding biometric information.  \nPlaintiffs thus a llege the Clearview defendants’ conduct violated their privacy rights and defendants’ \nuse of their  biometric information was without their knowledge and consent.   The centerpiece of \nthis MDL and plaintiffs’ class action lawsuit is the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 \nILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”) . \nLegal Standard  \nBecause the Court’s February 14, 2022 ruling did not dispose of this case in its entirety, the \nCourt reviews defendant s’ reconsideration motion under Rule  54(b) , which allows the Court to \nexercise its inherent authority to reconsider its interlocutory orders because such orders are “subject \nto revision at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims.”  See  Fed.R.Civ.P. \n54(b); Terry v. Spencer,  888 F.3d 890, 893 (7th Cir. 2018) .  Rule 54(b) motions for reconsideration \nserve the limited function of correcting manifest errors of law or fact.  See Rothwell Cotton Co. v. \nRosenthal & Co. , 827 F.2d 246, 251 (7th Cir. 1987) .  A manifest error of law is the “wholesale \ndisregard, m isapplication, or failure to recognize controlling precedent. ”  Oto v. Metropolitan Life Ins. \nCo., 224 F.3d 601, 606 ( 7th Cir. 2000)  (citation omitted).   “Such problems rarely arise and the \nmotion to reconsider should be equally  rare.”  Bank of Waunakee v. Rochester Cheese Sales, Inc. , 906 F.2d \n1185, 1191 ( 7th Cir. 1990)  (citation omitted).  \nDiscussion  \n In the present motion, the Clearview defendants request the Court to reconsider the \nfollowing:  (1)  defendants Thomas Mulcaire  (“Mulcaire”)  and Rocky Mountain Data Analytics, LLC \n(“Rocky Mountain”) waived their  personal jurisdiction defenses; (2)  Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain \nwaived the government -contract or exemption pursuant to 740 ILCS 14/25(e) ; (3) plaintiffs have \nArticle III standing to br ing the ir state law claims in Counts 8 -12 and 1 4; and (4) plaintiffs  have Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n Article III standing to bring their BIPA Section 15(c) claims in Counts 3 and 4.  Defendants also ask \nthe Court to clarify whether defendant Mulcaire was dismissed from this lawsuit . \nWaiver  \nThe Court starts with Mulcaire’s and Rocky Mountain’s waiver of their personal jurisdiction \ndefense.   To give context, in their opening brief, the  only time the  Clearview defendants raised \nMulcaire’s and Rocky Mountain’s personal jurisdiction defense was in footnote #2 , which state d:  \nMulcaire and Rocky Mountain also should be dismissed because the Court lacks \npersonal  jurisdiction over  them.  For similar reasons previously discussed by \nClearvie w, Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain did not  purposefully avail themselves of \nIllinois to establish minimum contacts with the state.  See Mutnick v.  Clearview AI , Inc., \n20-cv-512, ECF No. 46 at 6- 12, ECF No. 70 at 9- 16.  \n \nThe citation to Mutnick  and the cited briefs in footnote #2 support defendants ’ unsuccessful attempt to \ndismiss defendants Ton- That and Schwart z based on the lack of personal jurisdiction.  B ecause the \ncursory argument in footnote #2 was woefully inadequate , the Court concluded Mulcaire and Rocky \nMountain had waived  their personal jurisdiction argument .  See White v. United States , 8 F.4th 547, 552 \n(7th Cir. 2021) (“ perfunctory  and undeveloped arguments …are waived .”); Evergreen Square v. \nWisconsin Housing & Economic Dev. Auth. , 848 F.3d 822, 829 ( 7th Cir. 2017) (“ A party may  waive  an \nargument by presenting it only in an undeveloped footnote.” ). \nNow, the Clearview defendants argue the Court’s conclusion was a “manifest error” because \nthey cited fifte en pages of briefing  about personal jurisdiction in Mutnick .  There is no question \nthose briefs discussed the legal authority supporting defendants’ Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss \nbased on personal jurisdiction, but the factual focus was entirely on defendants Ton- That and \nSchwartz.  Indeed, Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain were not named defendants in Mutnick  or Hall v. \nCDW Government, LLC , 20-cv-0846.  In any event, analyzing personal jurisdiction is a fact -specific \ntask, and the Clearview  defendants did not provide the Court any factual reasons why Mulcaire and \nRocky Mountain did not have sufficient contacts with Illinois.  Therefore, the Court did not commit Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n a manife st error in this respect.  See  Oto, 224 F.3d at 606 (“ A ‘manifest error’ is not demonstrated by \nthe disappointment of the losing party.”).    \nLikewise, Mulcaire and Rocky Mountain waived their argument under the government -\ncontractor exemption to BIPA, 740 ILCS 14/25(e ), because they made this argument for the first \ntime in their reply brief.  In the present motion, defendants argue the only reason they made this \nargument for the first time in reply was due to a Cook County Circuit Court decision issued after \nthey filed their motion to dismiss, namely, Thornley v. CDW -Government , LLC, 20 CH 04346 (Cir. Ct. \nCook Cty . June 25, 2021).  Defendants contend this was the first time any court directly addressed \nthe government -contractor  exemption  under §  25(e).  That may be, but the main reason why \narguments made for the first time in reply  briefs  are waived is because the opposing side has not had \nthe opportunity to address the issue.  See White , 8 F.4th at 552- 53.  Defendants nonetheless contend \nthey put plaintiffs on notice of the state court Thornley  decision in a February 2, 2022 supplemental \nauthority letter, but that letter discusses a Northern District of Illinois case and personal jurisdiction.  \n(R. 274, 2/2/22, letter ).  This argument fails.  \nMeanwhile, defendants contend “[s]ince the Court will eventually need to address Mr. \nMulcaire’s and RM’s government -contractor defense, it would be more economical to do so now.  \nThe Court declines defendants’ invitation to address their  argument at this juncture because neither \nside has fully developed it.   The Court  thus  denies this aspect of defendants’ reconsideration motion.  \nArticle III Standing  \nDefendants also assert the Court committed a manifest error of law in concluding plaintiffs \nhad Article III standing to bring their state court claims in Counts 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14 because the \nCourt’s conclusion conflicts with TransUnion , LLC v. Ramirez , 141 S.Ct. 2190, 2200 (2021), and \nThornley  v. Clearview, 984 F.3d  1241, 1246 (7th Cir. 2021).  Defendants specifically argue plaintiffs do \nnot have Article III standing relying on Thornley  where the Seventh Circuit concluded the  plaintiffs Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n did not suffer any injury from defendant’s violation of §  15(c) except for statutory violations , and the \npresent plaintiffs’ allegations in the state court claims are “virtually identical” to the Thornley  claims.  \nDefendants’ reliance on the Sev enth Circuit ’s decision in Thornley  is misplaced because  in that matter \nthe plaintiffs purposely brought bare BIPA claims with no allegations of injuries  to avoid federal \ncourt jurisdiction.  Thornley , 984 F.3d at 1246;  Thornley  v. Clearview AI,  Inc., No. 20- cv-3843, 2020 WL \n6262356, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 23, 2020) (Coleman, J.) (“Plaintiffs purposely narrowed their claim to \nthe general prohibition of Clearview selling and profiting from plaintiffs ’ biometric data and filed \ntheir lawsuit in state court where such actions are allowed without the constraints of Article III \nstanding.”) .  Despite defendants’ argument to the contrary, class plaintiffs currently include \nallegations of injury  in their first amended consolidated class action complaint , including that \ndefendants’ nonconsensual taking and use of plaintiffs’ biometric information exposed them to \nnumerous imminent and impending injuries.   \nMoreover, d efendants’ reliance on T ransUnion  for the proposition that a victim of a privacy \nharm can only suffer an injury -in-fact for Article III standing if the victim’s information is \ndisseminated to a third -party is also unavailing.  T o clarify, in the context of the Fair Credit \nReporting Act (“FCRA”), the TransUnion  Court concluded that  certain  class members whose credit \nreports were not disseminated to third parties did not suffer a concrete injury -in-fact, keeping in \nmind that “history and tradition offer a meaningful guide to the types of cases that Article III \nempowers federal courts to cons ider.”   Id. at 2204.  As the TransUnion  Court clarified,  “with respect \nto the concrete -harm requirement in particular, this Court ’s opinion in Spokeo v. Robins  indicated that \ncourts should assess whether the alleged injury to the plaintiff has a ‘close rel ationship’ to a harm \n‘traditionally’ recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts” and that  this “inquiry \nasks whether plaintiffs have identified a close  historical  or common- law analogue for their asserted \ninjury.”  Id .  In TransUnion , the Supreme Court analogized the FCRA violations to the tort of Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n defamation, which requires that the defamatory statement be published to a third party.  Id . at 2209.  \nAccordingly , the TransUnion Court concluded that plaintiffs whose reports wer e not disseminated to \nthird parties did not allege a concrete injury -in-fact under the FCRA.  \nThe Seventh Circuit has analogized BIPA violations to common law privacy torts, which are \ndifferent common law torts than  defamation .  See Fox v. Dakkota Integrated Sys ., LLC,  980 F.3d 1146, \n1153 ( 7th Cir. 2020) ; Bryant  v. Compass Group USA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, 627 (7th Cir. 2020).  As the \nBryant  court held:  “ Bryant was asserting a violation of her own rights —her fingerprints, her private \ninformation—and that this is enough to show injury -in-fact without further tangible consequences.   \nThis was no bare procedural violation; it was an invasion of her private domain, much like an act of \ntrespass would be. ”  Id. at 624.  Therefore, defendants’  argument based on TransUnion  is without \nmerit . \nThe remainder of defendants’ arguments concerning Article III standing and plaintiffs’ state \nlaw claims were made for the first time in their reconsideration motion, and therefore, are waived. \nSee Baker v. Lindgren , 856 F.3d 498, 503 ( 7th Cir. 2017) .  Otherwise, defendants’ arguments \nconcerning “demonstratively false allegations” and plaintiffs’ lack of evid entiary support are best left \nfor summary judgment  or trial . \nNext , defendants maintain plaintiffs do not have Article III standing to bring their BIPA \nSection 15(c) claims in Counts 3 and 4, although defendants admit that they did not move to dismiss \nthese  claims in their motion to dismiss.  Again, arguments raised for the first time in a motion for  \nreconsideration are waived.   \nDefendant Mulcaire  \nIn addition, defendants seek clarification of a footnote in the Court’s February 14, 2022 \nruling about  defendant  Mulcaire.  The section of the ruling discussed whether Ton- That and \nSchwartz could be  liable for Clearview’s conduct under Delaware’ s personal participation doctrine.   Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 390 Filed: 07/25/22 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n See Prairie Capital III, L.P. v. Double E Holding Corp ., 132 A.3d 35, 60 (Del. Ch. 2015)  (“As the human \nthrough which the corporate principal acts, ‘ [a] corporate  officer can be held personally liable for the \ntorts he commits and cannot shield himself behind a corporation when he is a participant. ”).  The \nfootnote concerning Mulcaire stated:  “Plaintiffs do not argue that Clearview’s General Counsel, \nThomas Mulcaire, personally participated in the privacy torts by directing, ordering, ratifying, \napproving, or consenting to the tortious acts.  Therefore, he is not individually liable for Clearview’s \nactions. ”  The footnote, however, makes no mention of the  personal participation doctrine in \nrelation to Mulcaire’s involvement with Rocky Mountain.  Therefore, Mulcaire remains a defendant \nto this lawsuit.  \nOn a final note, the Court reminds the parties that motions for reconsideration do not \nprovide “ a vehicle for reargu ing previously rejected motions.”  Oto, 224 F.3d at 606.  As the Seventh \nCircuit instructs, manifest errors of law or fact rarely arise and motions for reconsideration should \nbe equally as rare.  See Bank of Waunakee , 906 F.2d at 1191.  As courts in this di strict have repeatedly \nreminded litigants, district courts’ opinions “are not intended as mere first drafts, subject to revision and reconsideration at a litigant’s pleasure.”  Ellenby Tech ., Inc. v. Fireking Security Group , 533 F.Supp.3d \n656, 660 (N.D.  Ill. 2021) (citation omitted).   With this in mind, before filing any further \nreconsideration motions, the parties must first seek leave from the Court to do so.  \nConclusion  \nThe Court, in its discretion,  denies defendants’ motion for reconsideration, but grants the \nmotion for clarification, namely, that Mulcaire remains a defendant to this lawsuit  [307].  The Court \nalso denies defendants’ request for oral argument on their motion for reconsideration because it is unnecessary [333].   Before filing any fu rther reconsideration motions in this lawsuit, the parties must \nfirst seek leave from the Court to do so.

Durkin  \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \nPlaintiff Ricardo Gutierrez brought this putative class action against \nDefendant Wemagine.AI LLP (“Wemagine”), alleging violations of the Illinois \nBiometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/1, et seq . Before \nthe Court is We magine ’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction , R. 9 . That \nmotion is granted.  \nBackground  \nWemagine is a limited liability partnership incorporated in Canada. Ricardo \nGutierrez  is an Illinois citizen. Wemagi ne develops and owns a mobile application, \nVoila AI Artist (“Voila”  or “App”), which uses artificial intelligence to extract a \nperson’s face from a photo and transform it to look like a cartoon. Wemagine collects \nthe facial geometry and biometric data of Voila user s.  \nOn September 23, 2021, Gutierrez filed a two -count class action complaint \nagainst Wemagine, alleging violations of BIPA . Specifically, Gutierrez alleges Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 1 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n Wemagine violated Sections 15(b) and 15(d) of BIPA when it collected, captured, used, \nand stored Gu tierrez’s biometric data without first obtaining a written release and \nby disclosing or otherwise disseminating his biometric information without obtaining \nwritten consent, as is required by the statute. Wemagine filed its motion to dismiss \non November 1, 2021, arguing this Court lacks jurisdiction over Wemagine.  \nLegal Standard  \n“A complaint need not include facts alleging personal jurisdiction. However, \nonce the defendant moves to dismiss the complaint under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(2) for lac k of personal jurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of \ndemonstrating the existence of jurisdiction.” Purdue Research Found. v. Sanofi -\nSynthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. 2003). The court reads the complaint \n“liberally, in its entirety, and with every inference drawn in fa vor” of the plaintiff to \ndetermine whether it has set forth a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction.” Cent. \nStates, Se. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund v. Phencorp Reinsurance Co. , 440 F.3d 870, \n877-78 (7th Cir. 2006). “[O]nce the defendant has submitted affidavits or other \nevidence in opposition to the exercise of jurisdiction, the plaintiff must go beyond the \npleadings and submit affirmative evidence supporting the exercise of jurisdiction.” \nPurdue , 338 F.3d at 783.  \nBecause this Court is sitting in diversity, it has personal jurisdiction over the \nparties to the extent that an Illinois court could exercise such jurisdiction. Philos \nTechs., Inc. v. Philos & D, Inc. , 645 F.3d 851, 855 n.2 (7th Cir. 2011). “Illinois  extends \npersonal jurisdiction to the limits allowed by the United States Constitution, so the Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 2 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n state and federal standards are congruent here.” Id. There are two forms  of personal \njurisdiction —general and specific.1 “Specific personal jurisdiction is a ppropriate \nwhere (1) the defendant has purposefully directed [its] activities at the forum state \nor purposefully availed [itself] of the privilege of conducting business in that state, \nand (2) the alleged injury arises out of the defendant’s forum -related activities.” N. \nGrain Mktg., LLC v. Greving , 743 F.3d 487, 492 (7th Cir. 2014) (citing Burger King \nCorp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 472 (1985)). The exercise of specific jurisdiction \n“must also comport with traditional notions of fair play and substantial  justice.” N. \nGrain , 743 F.3d at 492. In general, “[t]he defendant’s conduct and connection with \nthe forum state must be substantial enough to make it reasonable for the defendant \nto anticipate that [it] could be haled into court there.” Id. (citing Burger  King , 471 \nU.S. at 474).  \nAnalysis  \nGutierrez argues Wemagine has sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois \nbecause it has over 5,000 Viola users in Illinois, which , Gutierrez contends,  shows \nWemagine purposefully availed itself and directed its data collection efforts in the \nforum state. Gutierrez further  argues that his claims arise out of or relate to \nWemagine’s Illinois conduct —namely, the collection of Illinois residents’ biometric \ndata from their use of Viola. R. 12.  \nWemagine contends it has not purposefully availed itself to the privilege of \nconducti ng business in Illinois, as it is essentially an interactive website and did not \n \n1 Gutierrez does not argue the Court has general jurisdiction over Wemagine.  Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 3 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n specifically direct any business to Illinois. R. 10 at 6 -7. Wemagine p oints to  ample \ncase law from this  circuit and district which is in line with its position. See, e.g., \nbe2LL C v. Ivanov , 642 F.3d 555, 558 -59 (7th Cir. 2011) (explaining that a defendant \nmust “in some way target the forum state’s market” beyond “simply operating an \ninteractive website that is accessible from the forum state”); Gullen v. Facebook , 2016 \nWL 245910,  *6 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 21,  2016) (“[T ]he Seventh Circuit has rejected the notion \nthat an online merchant’s operation of an interactive website is sufficient to confer \nspecific jurisdiction on it in every state from which it can be accessed.”)2.  \nThe Court ag rees with Wemagine. The only connection between Wemagine and \nIllinois is Gutierrez. Gutierrez chose to download the Viola app. There was no \ndirected marketing specific to Illinois, and the fact that Viola is used by Illinois \nresidents does not, on its own,  create a basis for personal jurisdiction over Wemagine. \nPut simply, there must be a stronger connection between Illinois and Wemagine to \nsubject Wemagine to court proceedings in this district. This holding is in line with \nrecent holdings in this circuit and district —those  Courts that found personal \n \n2 Gutierrez argues Gullen  “clearly departs” from the case law in this district. R. 12 at \n8. However , Gutierrez cites cases in which defendants did significantly more than \nsimply run a n interactive  website accessible from the forum state. See id . (citing  \nNorberg  v. Shutterfly, Inc. , 152 F. Supp. 3d 1105,  1105  (N.D. Ill. 2015)  (finding \njurisdiction where the defendants offered photo printing services and shipped hard \ncopy photographs and other products to Illinois customers); Monster Energy Co.  v. \nWensheng , 136 F.  Supp. 3d  897, 906 (N.D. Ill.  2015) (finding jurisdiction where \ndefendants shipped counterfeit products to Illinois residents); Mercis B.V.  v. \nPartnerships and Unincorporated Associated Identified on Schedule ‘A’ , 2021 WL \n4699007, *1 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 19, 20 21) (finding jurisdiction where the defendant was \n“ready, willing, and able” to ship counterfeit products to Illinois)). The Court does not \nagree that Gullen departs from the case law in this district, and regardless , the \nSeventh Circuit ’s holding in Ivanov  is controlling on this Court.  Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 4 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n jurisdiction were presented with a more significant connection to Illinois than \nGutierrez has shown here. The Seventh Circuit found personal jurisdiction in Curry \nv. Revolution Labs., LLC , where online purchasers selected an Illinois shipping \naddress , receiv ed a confirmation email confirming their Illinois address , and received \nproducts in the mail . 949 F.3d 385, 389 (7th Cir. 2020). Similarly, i n King v. PeopleNet \nCorp. , personal jurisdiction existed where the defendant had provided products and \nservices to the pl aintiff’s employer. 2021 WL 5006692, * 6 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 18, 2021). The \ndefendant in King  entered into business contracts with multiple Illinois businesses \nand shipped devices to them. Id. The district court found that the defendant \npurposefully availed itself when it “sought out the Illinois timekeeping market.” Id. \nat *7 .  \nOn the othe r hand, in Stein v. Clarifai , the district court found that personal \njurisdiction was not present  where the only alleged tie with Illinois was that the \nplaintiff lived here, used an interactive dating website, and the defendant worked \nwith a Chicago -based venture capital fund whose principals founded the dating \nwebsite. Stein , 526 F. Supp. 3d 339 (N.D. Ill. 2021). The defendant in Stein  was a \ntechnology company in New York that collected photos from the plaintiff’s social \nmedia profile and used her biometri c facial information without her consent. The \ncourt held the defendant merely ran an interactive website that did not specifically \ntarget Illinois residents and had no other relevant ties to Illinois. Id. at 344. This was \ntrue even though the defendant sol d its demographic model directly to two Illinois \ncustomers. Id. The court found it would be unjust to subject the defendant to personal Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 5 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n jurisdiction in this district because the contacts with Illinois did not come from “suit -\nrelated activity with the forum state.” Id. “To hold otherwise would mean that a \nplaintiff coul d bring suit in literally any state where the defendant shipped at least \none item.” Id. at 345 -46 (citing Advanced Tactical Ordnance Ss., LLC v. Real Action \nPaintball , Inc., 752 F.3d 796, 801 (7th Cir. 2014)) ; see also Salkauskaite v. Sephora \nUSA, Inc. , 2020 WL 2796122, *5 (N.D. Ill. May 30, 2020) (no personal jurisdiction \nwhere the defendant did not target its marketing or sales toward Illinois, and the fact \nthat “the technology was used in Illinois does not establish minimum contacts”); Bray \nv. Lathem Tim e Co. , 2020 WL 1492742, *2 (C.D. Ill. Mar. 27, 2020) (no personal \njurisdiction where the defendant had no directed advertising toward Illinois even \nthough its web -service was available there, because “the plaintiff cannot be the sole \nlink between the defen dant and the forum”); McGoveran v. Amazon Web Services, \nInc., 488 F. Supp. 3d 714 , 722  (S.D. Ill. 2020) (no personal jurisdiction where  the \ndefendant was registered to do business in Illinois, because “nothing about the \n[allegedly harmful conduct] occurred  in Illinois except for the [action of the \nplaintiffs].”).  \nGutierrez only alleges that Viola is available and used by Illinois residents. R. \n12 at 3 (“Plaintiff is an Illinois resident who used the App in Illinois and alleges that \nhis facial geometry was collected by the Defendant in Illinois.”). Unlike the \ndefendants in King  and Curry , there is no evidence that Wemagine purposefully \ndirected any of its conduct toward Illinois , did any Illinois -specific shipping, \nmarketing , or advertising , or sought out the Illinois market  in any way . Indeed , Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 6 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n Wemagine is not registered to do business in Illinois, has no employees in Illinois, \nand any alleged harm in this case was oc casioned by  Gutierrez’s conduct of \ndownloading and using the Viola App .  \nDue process requires that a defendant be  haled into the forum state based on \nits own affiliation with the state, not “random, fortuitous, or attenuated” contacts \nmade by interacting with persons affiliated with the state. Walden  v. Fiore , 571 U.S. \n277, 286 (2014)  (citing Burger King , 471 U.S. 462, 475 (1985)). The only contact with \nthe forum state here is Gutierrez (and other members of the putative class) \ndownloading an app and using it. This attenuated contact is not sufficient for the \nCourt to exercise personal jurisdiction over W emagine, and to do so would essentially \nbe to hold that Wemagine is subject to personal jurisdiction in the entire United \nStates , because Viola is available nationwide (as well as internationally) . Because \nGutierrez has not demonstrated that Wemagine has minimum contacts with Illinois \nor directed its suit -related actions at Illinois so as to subject it to this Court’s \njurisdiction, the Court must dismiss his complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction.  \nConclusion  \nFor the reasons set forth above , Wemag ine’s motion to dismiss for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction, R. 9, is granted. If Gutierrez wishe s to seek leave to file an \namended complaint, he must do so no later than twenty -one (21) days from the entry \nof this order. Any motion fo r leave to amend must include a copy of the proposed \namended complaint, a redline version showing change s from the or iginal complaint, Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 19 Filed: 01/26/22 Page 7 of 8 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n \nand a brief o f no more than five (5) pages explain ing how the proposed amended \ncomplaint cures the deficiencies identified in this opinion.  \n \n \n \nENTERED : \n         \n        _____________________________  \n        Honorable Thomas M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court opinion grants final approval for a class action settlement between plaintiffs, who operated vehicles equipped with Lytx DriveCam systems, and defendants Maverick Transportation LLC and Lytx, Inc. The case involves allegations that Lytx used machine vision and artificial intelligence (AI) in its DriveCam devices to predict distracted driving behaviors, collecting and storing biometric data without consent, in violation of Illinois' Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The settlement includes a $4.25 million fund to compensate class members and provides for attorneys' fees and service awards to class representatives.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: The key legal issue is whether Lytx violated BIPA by using its AI-enabled DriveCam devices to collect and store biometric data of drivers without their consent.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court approved the class action settlement as fair, reasonable, and adequate, certifying the settlement class and ordering that the agreed terms and conditions be implemented, including monetary compensation from the settlement fund and dismissal of the action with prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company put cameras in vehicles that could tell when drivers weren't paying attention. This tech used computer smarts, like a brain, to do this without asking permission to use people's face data. People sued, saying this wasn't right. The company agreed to pay a lot of money to make up for it and promise to follow better rules. The judge said this was a good idea, and now the deal is official.",

(Doc. 132). The Motion re ferences and incorporates a \nClass Action Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement” or “Set tlement Agreement”) \n(Doc. 125) that, together  with the attached exhibits, sets  forth the terms and conditions \nfor the settlement of claims, on a class-wide  basis, between Plaintiffs Joshua Lewis, \nNathaniel Timmons, and James Cavanaugh (“Plai ntiffs”), individually and on behalf of \nthe Settlement Class, and Defendant Lytx, In c. (“Lytx” or “Defendant,” and, along with \nPlaintiffs, the “Parties”). \nHaving carefully considered the Motion, the Settlement Agreement together with \nits exhibits and attachments, the record in this matter, and all the files, records, and \nproceedings herein, including arguments set forth at the Final Approval Hearing on the Settlement, the Court ORDERS  as follows: Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 1 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 2 of 9 \n 1. This Final Approval Order (“Order”) incorporates by reference the \ndefinitions in the Settlement Agreement (Doc. 125). All term s defined in the Settlement \nAgreement shall have the same meaning in this Order. \n2. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this Action pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1332(d).  \nCERTIFICATION OF THE SETTLEMENT CLASS  \n3. The Court preliminarily certified the Settlement Class in its Preliminary \nApproval Order. (Doc. 126). \n4. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a), (b)(3), and (e), and solely \nfor purposes of settl ement, the Court certifies of th e following Settlement Class: \nAll individuals who, while present in the State of Illinois, operated a \nvehicle equipped with a Lytx  DriveCam® Event Recorder \n(“DriveCam”) and for whom machine vision and artificial \nintelligence (“MV+AI”) was used to predict distracted driving \nbehaviors between October 12, 2016, and January 1, 2025.  \n5. For settlement purposes only, the Court confirms the appointment of \nPlaintiffs Joshua Lewis, Nathaniel Ti mmons, and James Cavanaugh as Class \nRepresentatives of the Settlement Class, and finds that they have adequately represented \nthe Settlement Class. \n6. For settlement purposes only, the Court confirms the appointment of the \nfollowing law firms as Class Counsel, and find s they are experienced in class litigation \nand have adequately represented the Settlement Class:  Carney Bates & Pulliam PLLC; \nLieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP; Milberg Coleman Bryson Phillips Grossman \nPLLC; Fish Potter Bolanos, P.C.; and Werman Salas P.C.

For settlement purposes only, the Court finds that the requirements of \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3 ) are satisfied for the following reasons:  \n(1) the Settlement Class is so numerous that  joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of la w and fact common to members of the Settlement Class that \npredominate over questions affecting only individual members ( e.g., whether Lytx \ncollected and stored Settlemen t Class Members’ biometric data, without consent, through \ndash cam devices in a manner that violat ed BIPA, and whether Plaintiffs and the \nSettlement Class Members are entitled to uniform statutory damages under BIPA); \n(3) Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims  of the Settlement Class; (4) Plaintiffs and \nClass Counsel have and will continue to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the \nSettlement Class; and (5) a class action is a superior method of fairly and efficiently \nadjudicating this Action.  \nFINAL APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT AND NOTICE PROGRAM  \n8. The Court approves the Settlement as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the \nbest interests of the Settlement Class Member s. The Court has specif ically considered the \nfactors relevant to class settlement approv al pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 23(e)(2), including whether: \n(A) the Class Representatives and Cla ss Counsel have adequately \nrepresented the Settlement Class; \n \n(B) the Settlement was negotiated at arm’s length;  (C) the relief provided for the Settlem ent Class is adequate, taking into \naccount (i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; (ii) the terms \nof any proposed award of attorn eys’ fees and costs, and Class \nRepresentative service award, including the timing of payment and Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 3 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 4 of 9 \n any justification for the awards; an d (iii) any agreement required to \nbe identified under Rule 23(e)(3); and  \n \n(D) the Settlement treats Settlement Class Members equitably relative to \neach other. \n \nThe Court has also considered other factors relevant to class settlement approval, \nincluding, inter alia , “(1) the strength of the case for plaintiffs on the merits, balanced \nagainst the extent of settlement offer; (2) the complexity, length, and expense of further \nlitigation; (3) the amount of opposition to the settlement; (4) the reaction of members of \nthe class to the settlement; (5) the opinion of competent counsel; and (6) stage of the \nproceedings and th e amount of discovery completed.” See Wong v. Accretive Health, Inc.,  \n773 F.3d 859, 863 (7th Cir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted). \n9. Having considered the terms of the Settlement and the record before it, the \nCourt finds that the Class Representati ves and Class Counsel have adequately \nrepresented the interests of Settlement Class Members; the settlement consideration \nprovided under the Settlement constitutes fair value given in exchange  for the release of \nthe Released Claims against th e Released Parties; the Settlem ent is the result of arm’s-\nlength negotiations by experienced, well-q ualified counsel that included a day-long \nmediation conducted by a neutral mediator ; the Settlement provides meaningful \nmonetary benefits ( i.e. a $4,250,000 non-reversionary settlem ent fund (the “Settlement \nFund”)) to Settlement Class Members, and such benefits are not disproportionate to the \nattorneys’ fees and expenses  sought by Class Counsel; the benefits provided treat \nSettlement Class Members equitably; and the Settlement is reasonab le and appropriate \nunder the circumstances of this Action, including the risks, complexity, expense and Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 4 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 5 of 9 \n duration of the Action, as well as the reaction of the Settlement Class. The Court further \nfinds that there is no evidence of collusion in connection with the Settlement Agreement, \nimplicit or otherwise. \n10. The Court finds that the notice program as set forth in the Settlement \nAgreement and effectuated pursuant to the Preliminary Approval Order satisfies the \nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2) and due process and constitutes \nthe best notice practicable under the circumstances and shall constitute due and sufficient \nnotice to the Settlement Class of (a) the nature of the case; (b) the terms of the Settlement, \nincluding the definition of the Settlement Cl ass; (c) the class claims and issues; (d) the \nprocedure for objecting to or opting out of the Settlement; (e) that the Court will exclude \nfrom the Settlement Class any Settlement Cl ass member who timely and validly requests \nexclusion; (f) the time and manner for requesting such exclusion; (g) contact information \nfor Class Counsel, the Settlement Administrato r, the Settlement Website, and a toll-free \nnumber to ask questions about the Settlement; (h) important dates in the settlement \napproval process, including the deadlines to request exclusion or object and the date of \nthe Final Approval Hearing; (i) Class Coun sel’s request for an award of reasonable \nattorneys’ fees and expenses; (j) the Class Representatives’ application for a service \naward; and (k) the binding effect of a cla ss judgment on Settlement Class members under \nRule 23(c)(3). \n11. The Court reaffirms its appointment of the Settlement Administrator to \nperform the functions and duties of notice and settlement administration as set forth in \nthe Settlement Agreement and to provide such other administration services as are Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 5 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 6 of 9 \n reasonably necessary to facilitate the comple tion of the Settlement. Accordingly, Class \nCounsel and the Settlement Administrator are directed to administer the Settlement in \naccordance with its terms and provisions. \n12. The Court notes, moreover, that no objections or opt-outs were filed in \nconnection with the Settlement. \n13. The Court APPROVES  the Settlement in all respects and orders that the \nSettlement Agreement be consummated and im plemented in accordance with its terms \nand conditions. \n14. The Parties, without further approval from the Court, are authorized to \nagree and adopt such amendments, modifica tions, and expansions of the Settlement \nAgreement and its implementing  documents (including all exhibits to the Settlement \nAgreement) so long as they ar e consistent in all material re spects with this Order and do \nnot limit the rights of Settlement Class Members. \n15. The Court shall retain exclusive and continuing jurisdiction to resolve any \ndisputes or challenges that may arise in  connection with the Settlement Agreement, \nincluding any challenge to the performance,  validity, interpreta tion, administration, \nenforcement, or enforc eability of the Notice, this Order, or the Settlement Agreement. \n16. In the event that this Order is revers ed on appeal or otherwise does not \nbecome final, (i) this Order shall be rendered null and void and shall be vacated nunc pro \ntunc, (ii) the Settlement Agreement and other related orders shall be rendered null and \nvoid and shall be vacated nunc pro tunc , (iii) the Settlement Fund shall be refunded to the \nDefendant, less settlement administrative expenses actually incurred and paid, and Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 6 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 7 of 9 \n (iv) the Action shall proceed as if no settlement had occurre d and as otherwise provided \nfor in the Settlem ent Agreement. \n17. Neither the Settlement Agreement, th e Settlement contained therein, the \nnegotiation nor any proceeding or document executed pursuant to or in furtherance \nthereof, (i) is or shall be construed as, an admission of, or evidence of, the truth of any \nallegation or of any liability or the validity of  any claim or defense, in whole or in part, \non the part of any party in any respect, or (ii) is or shall be admissible in any action or \nproceeding for any reason, other than an action or proceeding to enforce the terms of the \nSettlement or this Order. \nDISMISSAL AND FINAL JUDGMENT \n18. Upon issuance of Final Judgment in this case, the Action will be dismissed \nwith prejudice, with each party to bear its own costs. \n19. Upon the Effective Date and by operation of this Order, the Releasing \nParties (including Plaintiffs and those Settlement Class Members who do not timely \nexclude themselves from the Settlement Class), and each of  them, shall be deemed to \nhave, and by operation of the Final Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever \nreleased, relinquished, and discharged all Rele ased Claims against th e Released Parties. \nFurther, upon the Effective Date, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, each \nSettlement Class Member, shall, either direct ly, indirectly, representatively, or in any \ncapacity, be permanently barred and enjoined from filing, commencing, prosecuting, \ncontinuing, pursuing, intervening in, or partic ipating (as a class member or otherwise) in \nany lawsuit, action, or other proceeding in an y jurisdiction (other than participation in Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 7 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 8 of 9 \n the Settlement) against any Released Party based on the Released Claims. \n20. Upon the Effective Date and by operat ion of this Order and Final Judgment, \nthe Settlement Agreement will be binding on and will have res judicata  and preclusive \neffect in all pending and future lawsuits or ot her proceedings maintained by or on behalf \nof Plaintiffs and the Releasing Parties. \n21. The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiffs’ unopposed Motion for Final Approval \nof Class Action Se ttlement (Doc. 132). \n22. This Court directs entry of this Order and Final Judgment pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 based upon the Court’s finding that there is no just \nreason for delay of enforcemen t or appeal of this Final Judgment. The Clerk of the Court \nshall close the file in this matter.  \nATTORNEYS’ FEES, LITIGATION EXPENSES, AND SERVICE AWARDS \n23. The Court also has consid ered Plaintiffs’ Motion  for Attorneys’ Fees, \nLitigation Expenses, and Service Awards (D oc. 128), the supporting memorandum of law \n(Doc. 129), and the declaration of Class Counse l (Doc. 130). The Court finds, based on its \nreview of the relevant submissions, that (i) the payment of attorneys’ fees in the amount \nof one-third of the Settle ment Fund, or $1,416,666.67, and (ii) the reimbursem ent of out-\nof-pocket litigation expenses  in the amount of $63,495.79 are reasonable under Rule 23. \nSuch payment shall be made pursuant to and in the manner provided by the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement. \n24. The Court further finds that the reques ted service awards to each of the \nthree Class Representatives are fair and reasonable. As such, the Court approves a service Case 3:22-cv-00046-NJR     Document 138     Filed 07/25/25     Page 8 of 9     Page ID\n#<pageID>Page 9 of 9award to each Class Representative in the amount of $10,000, to be paid from the \nSettlement Fund in the manner set forth in the Settlement Agreement.\n25. The Court thus GRANTS Plaintiffs’ counsel’s unopposed Motion for \nAttorneys’ Fees, Litigation Expens es, and Service Awards (Doc. 128).\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\nDATED:  July 25, 2025\n____________________________\nNANCY J.

    "summary": "**1. Summary:**\nThis court case involves a civil rights complaint filed by Lindsay Spilsbury against Carice, Seth, and Vera Demchok. Spilsbury alleges that the defendants exploited her using artificial intelligence by creating an account in her name on an online gaming platform and selling her identity on the dark web, among other claims. The court granted Spilsbury's request to proceed without prepaying fees but ordered her to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for failing to state a valid claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and potential jurisdictional issues due to related state court proceedings.\n\n**2. Key Legal Issue:**\nThe primary legal issue is whether Spilsbury’s complaint sufficiently alleges a violation of her federally protected rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by the defendants acting under the color of state law, and whether the court has jurisdiction considering ongoing related state court proceedings.\n\n**3. Court's Holding:**\nThe court granted Spilsbury's application to proceed in forma pauperis but ordered her to amend her complaint to show cause why her case should not be dismissed for failing to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and for being barred by the Younger abstention and Rooker-Feldman doctrines. The court gave her 21 days to respond with an amended complaint that addresses these issues.\n\n**4. ELI5 Explanation:**\nImagine someone is trying to sue some people because they think they were wronged, but they don't have enough money to pay the court fees. The court allowed this person to proceed without paying up front. However, the court isn't sure if it can actually handle the case, partly because another similar case might already be happening in a different court. The person has to explain more about their case to convince the court why it should be the one to deal with it. If not, the case could be thrown out. In this situation, she also claims that some technology, like robots or AI, was used to cause her harm, but she needs to clarify her story and how exactly the law was broken.",

No. 2:25-cv-00646-KRS CARICE DEMCHOK, \nSETH DEMCHOK and VERA DEMCHOK, \n  Defendants. \nORDER GRANTING APPLICATION TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS  \nAND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \n \n THIS MATTER  comes before the Court on pro se  Plaintiff’s Civil Rights Complaint \nPursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (“ Complaint”), (Doc. 1), file d July 9, 2025, and Plaintiff’s \nApplication to Proceed in District Court Without Prepaying Fees or Costs (“Application”), (Doc. \n2), filed July 9, 2025. \nI. APPLICATION TO PROCEED IN FORMA PAUPERIS  \n The statute for proceedings in forma pauperis , 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a), provides that the Court \nmay authorize the commencement of any suit without  prepayment of fees by a person who submits \nan affidavit that includes a stat ement of all assets the person posse sses and that the person is unable \nto pay such fees.  \nWhen a district court receives an applica tion for leave to proceed  in forma pauperis, \nit should examine the papers and determine if the requirements of [28 U.S.C.] § 1915(a) are satisfied. If they are, leave should be granted. Thereafter, \nif the court finds that the allegations of  poverty are untrue or that the action is \nfrivolous or malicious, it  may dismiss the case[.] \n \nMenefee v. Werholtz , 368 Fed.Appx. 879, 884 (10th Cir. 2010) (citing Ragan v. Cox , 305 F.2d 58, \n60 (10th Cir. 1962). “The statute [allowing a litig ant to proceed in form a pauperis] was intended Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 1 of 62 \n for the benefit of those too poor to pay or give security for costs....” Adkins v. E.I. DuPont de \nNemours & Co.,  335 U.S. 331, 344 (1948). While a litigant n eed not be “absolutely destitute,” “an \naffidavit is sufficient which states that one canno t because of his poverty pa y or give security for \nthe costs and still be able to provide himsel f and dependents with th e necessities of life.” Id. at \n339.   The Court grants Plaintiff’s Application to Proceed in District Court Without Prepaying \nFees or Costs. Plaintiff signed an affidavit st ating she is unable to pay the costs of these \nproceedings and provided the following information:  (i) Plaintiff’s average monthly income during \nthe past 12 months is $2,600.00; (i i) Plaintiff has $600.00 in a bank acc ount; (iii) Plaintiff has three \nsons who rely on her for support; and (iv) Plaintiff states: “I have limited income temporary support \nto survive.”\n1 The Court finds that Plaintiff is unable to  pay the costs of this proceeding because \nPlaintiff signed an affidavit stating she is unable to pay the costs of these proceedings and Plaintiff \nhas three sons who re ly on her for support. \nII. ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \n Plaintiff filed her Complaint using the form “Civil Rights Complaint Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.” Where the Complaint form prompt s plaintiffs to indica te whether defendants \nwere acting under color of state la w, Plaintiff marked the “Yes” box. See Complaint at 1, 3. Plaintiff \nalleges Defendants have opened an account on the online gaming platform “Steam” using her \nname, stalk her using a fl ying aircraft, have used robots and artificial intelligence to exploit \nPlaintiff, and sold Plaintiff’s identity to the dark web. See Complaint at 2-12.  \nThe Complaint fails to state claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. “The two elements of a \nSection 1983 claim are (1) depriv ation of a federally protected right by (2) an actor acting under \n \n1 Plaintiff states her monthly expenses include $300.00 for rent and $300.00 for a rental car but did not state her \nmonthly amounts for utilities, food, clothing, medical and dental or other expenses. Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 2 of 63 \n color of state law.” Schaffer v. Salt Lake City Corp. , 814 F.3d 1151, 1155 (10th Cir. 2016). Plaintiff \nhas not alleged any facts showing that Defenda nts were acting under color of state law.  \n Plaintiff states she has begun other lawsuits in the Third Judicial District Court dealing \nwith the same facts in volved in this action. See Complaint at 13. It appe ars the Court may lack \njurisdiction over this case pursuant to the Younger  abstention doctrine and/or the Rooker-Feldman  \ndoctrine due to the st ate court proceedings. \nThe Younger  abstention doctrine “dictate s that federal courts not interfere with state court \nproceedings . . . when such relief could adeq uately be sought before the state court.” Rienhardt v. \nKelly , 164 F.3d 1296, 1302 (10th Cir. 1999); D.L. v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 497 , 392 F.3d 1223, \n1228 (10th Cir. 2004) (“ Younger  abstention is jurisdictional”) (citing Steel Co. v. Citizens for a \nBetter Env. , 523 U.S. 83, 100 n.3 (1998)). In determining whether Younger  abstention is \nappropriate, the Court considers whether: \n(1) there is an ongoing state . . . civil . . . proceeding, (2) the state court provides an \nadequate forum to hear the claims raised in the federal complaint, and (3) the state \nproceedings involve important state intere sts, matters which traditionally look to \nstate law for their resolution or implicate separately articulated state policies. Younger  abstention is non-discretionary; it  must be invoked once the three \nconditions are met, absent ex traordinary circumstances.  \n \nAmanatullah v. Colo. Bd. of Med. Exam’rs , 187 F.3d 1160, 1163 (10th Cir. 1999) (citations \nomitted).  \nThe Rooker-Feldman  doctrine:  \nbars federal district cour ts from hearing cases “br ought by state-co urt losers \ncomplaining of injuries caused by state-c ourt judgments rendered before the district \ncourt proceedings commenced and inviting di strict court review and rejection of \nthose judgments.” Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp. , 544 U.S. 280, \n284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). Wh ere the relief requested would \nnecessarily undo the stat e court’s judgment, Rooker-Feldman  deprives the district \ncourt of jurisdiction. Mo’s Express, 441 F.3d at 1237.  Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 3 of 64 \n Velasquez v. Utah , 775 Fed.Appx. 420, 422 (10th Cir. 2019);  Knox v. Bland , 632 F.3d 1290, 1292 \n(10th Cir. 2011) (“Under [the Rooker-Feldman ] doctrine, ‘a party losing in state court is barred \nfrom seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a United States \ndistrict court, based on the losi ng party’s claim that the state j udgment itself violates the loser’s \nfederal rights’“) (quoting Johnson v. De Grandy , 512 U.S. 997, 1005-06 (1994)). \nAs the party seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of  this Court, Plaintiff bears the burden of \nalleging facts that s upport jurisdiction. See Dutcher v. Matheson , 733 F.3d 980, 985 (10th Cir. \n2013) (“Since federal courts are courts of limite d jurisdiction, we presume no jurisdiction exists \nabsent an adequate showing by the party invoking federal jurisdiction”); Evitt v. Durland , 243 F.3d \n388, at *2 (10th Cir. 2000) (“even if  the parties do not raise the que stion themselves, it is our duty \nto address the apparent lack of  jurisdiction sua sponte”) (quoting Tuck v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n,  \n859 F.2d 842, 843 (10th Cir.1988).    The Court orders Plaintiff to show cause  why the Court should not dismiss this case \npursuant to Younger  and/or Rooker-Feldman and for failure to state a claim pursuant to \n42 U.S.C. § 1983. If Plaintiff asserts the Court should not dismiss this case, Pl aintiff must file an \namended complaint that states a claim upon which re lief can be granted and that shows that this \ncase is not barred by Younger  and/or Rooker-Feldman . Plaintiff must identify each case in state \ncourt dealing with the same facts involved in this  action including the name of the courts and the \ncase numbers. Plaintiff must also indicate whethe r the state court proceeding is ongoing, has been \ndismissed and whether Plaintiff has appealed any final judgment in the st ate court proceeding. The \namended complaint must comply with the Federa l and Local Rules of Civil Procedure and must \nstate a claim over which th e Court has jurisdiction. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(b) (“A party must state \nits claims or defenses in numbered paragraphs”); Nasious v. Two Unknown B.I.C.E. Agents, at Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 4 of 65 \n Arapahoe Cnty.

III. NOTICE OF CASE MANAGEMENT \nGenerally, pro se  litigants are held to the same standards of professional \nresponsibility as traine d attorneys. It is a pro se  litigant’s responsibility to become \nfamiliar with and to comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure  and the Local \nRules of the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico  (the “Local \nRules”).  \nGuide for Pro Se Litigants at 4, United States Di strict Court, District of New Mexico (October \n2022). The Local Rules, the Guide for Pro Se Litig ants and a link to the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure are available on the Court’s website: http://www.nmd.uscourts.gov . \nFailure to comply with Court Orders and the Federal and Local Rules of Civil Procedure \ninterferes with the judi cial process and may result in mo netary and non-monetary sanctions \nincluding filing restrictions and dismissal of this case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) (“If the plaintiff \nfails to prosecute or to comply with these rules or a court order, a defendant may move to dismiss \nthe action”); Gustafson v. Luke , 696 Fed.Appx. 352, 354 (10th Cir. 2017) (“Although the language \nof Rule 41(b) requires that th e defendant file a motion to di smiss, the Rule  has long been \ninterpreted to permit cour ts to dismiss actions sua  sponte for a plaintiff’s failure to prosecute or \ncomply with the rules of civil proc edure or court’s orders.”) (quoting Olsen v. Mapes , 333 F.3d \n1199, 1204 n.3 (10th Cir. 2003)). IV. COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 11  \nThe Court reminds Plaintiff of her obligations pu rsuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure. See Yang v. Archuleta , 525 F.3d 925, 927 n. 1 (10th Cir. 2008) (“ Pro se  status Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 5     Filed 08/07/25     Page 5 of 66 \n does not excuse the obligation of any litigant to comply with the fundament al requirements of the \nFederal Rules of Civil and Appellate Procedure.”). Rule 11(b) provides: \nRepresentations to the Court.  By presenting to the court a pleading, written \nmotion, or other paper--whether by signi ng, filing, submitting, or later advocating \nit--an attorney or unrepresent ed party certifies that to  the best of the person’s \nknowledge, information, and belief, formed  after an inquiry reasonable under the \ncircumstances:  (1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause \nunnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;  (2) the claims, defenses, and other legal c ontentions are warranted by existing law \nor by a nonfrivolous argument for extendi ng, modifying, or reversing existing law \nor for establishing new law;  (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, \nwill likely have evidentiary support afte r a reasonable opportunity for further \ninvestigation or discovery; and  (4) the denials of factual contentions ar e warranted on the evidence or, if \nspecifically so identified, are reasonably ba sed on belief or a la ck of information. \n \nFed. R. Civ. P. 11(b). Failure to comply with th e requirements of Rule 11 may subject Plaintiff to \nsanctions, including monetary pena lties and nonmonetary directives. See Fed. R. Civ.

    "summary": "1. Summary: In the case, Clarence Risher filed a class-action lawsuit against Adecco, Inc. and Locutus, Inc., claiming they violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) by sending unsolicited text messages using an AI-operated chatbot named Mya. The court dismissed Risher's claims about an autodialer and the metaphorical use of \"voice\" for text messages, aligning with the Supreme Court’s decision limiting the scope of autodialers and defining texts as not falling within the TCPA’s provision on artificial or prerecorded voice.\n\n2. Key Legal Issue: Whether the unsolicited text messages sent by the AI chatbot Mya fall under the TCPA's prohibition on calls made using an \"artificial or prerecorded voice.\"\n\n3.

INTRODUCTION  \n In this putative class action, plaintiff Clarence Risher alleges defendants Adecco, Inc. and \nLocutus, Inc. (formerly Mya Systems, Inc. ) violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 \nU.S.C. § 227 (“TCPA”) by sending text messages to his cell phone, soliciting him for possible \nemployment through Adecco, which operates a job placement service. The operative fourth \namended complaint adva nces three claims for relief. The first claim  alleges defendants utilized an \nautomatic telephone dialing syste m. Risher concedes, however, that in light of the Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid , 141 S. Ct. 1163 (2021), which applied a more \nrestrictive construction of “autodialer,” his first claim for relief is not tenable and may be \ndismissed.  \n Defendants’ present motion does not challenge the second claim for relief, which asserts \ndefendants sent the text messages notwithstanding the fact that Risher’s telephone number was \nlisted on the National Do Not Call Registry.  The only question presented by the motion to dismiss, Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 1 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  therefore, is whether text messages fall within the provisions of the TCPA  prohibiting unsolicited \ncalls made using an “artificial or prerecorded voice.”    \n Risher also challenges a discovery order entered by the assigned magistra te judge. For the \nreasons below, the motion to dismiss will be granted, and the objection to the discovery ruling will \nbe overruled.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND  \n Risher alleges that in 2008  he submitted information to Adecco’s job placement services \nseeking employmen t in either a “data entry” position or as a “desktop support technician.” He was \nnot hired for either of those positions, and had no further contact with Adecco. Nearly 11 years \nlater,  however,  in 2019, Risher received a text message stating , “Hello Claren ce, this is Mya from \nAdecco. We’re hiring for Refurbisher roles, and I thought you might be interested. Do you have a \nminute to chat via text? You can also reply ‘no more texts’.” Risher ignored the message. Some \nhours later he received a further text mess age asking, “Hi Clarence! It’s Mya again. Are you free \nto chat for a few minutes?”  \n “Mya,” was not a human being, but a “chatbot” —a computer program  utilizing so -called \nartificial intelligence to  recognize a consumer’s responses and  lead a conversation wi th an \nindividual in natural language by mimicking a human.  Mya was developed and operated by \nLocutus, under a contractual relationship with Adecco.   \n \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD S \nA complaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the  \npleader is entitled to reli ef.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2).  While “detailed factual allegations” are not \nrequired, a complaint must have sufficient factual allegations to state a claim that is “plausible on \nits face.”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 ( 2009) (citing Bell Atl. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, \n555, 570 (2007)). A claim is facially plausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that \nallows the court to  draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 2 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  alleged.”  Id. (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556). This standard asks for “more than a sheer \npossibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.” Id. The determination is a context -specific task \nrequiring the court “to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.” Id. at 679.   \n A motion to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure tests the legal sufficiency of the cl aims alleged in the complaint. See Conservation \nForce v. Salazar , 646 F.3d 1240, 1241 -42 (9th Cir. 2011). Dismiss al under Rule 12(b)(6) may be \nbased on either the “lack of a cognizable legal theory” or on “the absence of sufficient facts \nalleged under a cognizable legal theory.”  Id. at 1242 (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). When evaluating such a moti on, the court must accept all material allegations in the \ncomplaint as true and construe them in the light most favorable to the non -moving party. In re \nQuality Sys., Inc. Sec. Litig. , 865 F.3d 1130, 1140 (9th Cir. 2017).  \n As to Risher’s objection to the d iscovery order, a district court may modify a magistrate \njudge ’s ruling on a non -dispositive matter only if the order is “clearly erroneous” or “contrary to \nlaw.” 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A); Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a); Bahn v. NME Hospitals, Inc ., 929 F.2d 1404, \n1414 (9th Cir.1991).  \n \nIV.  DISCUSSION  \n A.  Motion to dismiss  \n In the absence of express consent, section 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii) of the TCPA, and \nits implementing regulations at 47 CFR § 64.1200(a)(2), prohibit non -emergency calls to cell \nphone s that are made  “using any automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded \nvoice .” As noted, Risher agrees that his claim that defendants used an “automatic telephone \ndialing system” cannot go forward. Risher also acknowledges that the t ext messages sent to him \nwere not  a “voice” in the sense of audibl e, spoken , words. Risher contends, however, that the \nmessages had a “voice” in a metaphorical sense —indeed that the very intent of the Mya chatbot is \nto create the impression of an interacti ve human “voice,” responding conversationally. Risher \nfurther argues that the texts, although silent, represent the very type of automated, mass messaging Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 3 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n4 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that TCPA was intended to prevent.  \n Risher’s position is not frivolous. As one court observed, “ the p olicy of protecting \ntelephone privacy might be advanced by a prohibition on unwanted text messages . . . .” Mina v. \nRed Robin International, Inc ., Case No. 20 -cv-00612 -RM-KLM (August 18, 2022, D. Col.). As \nthe Mina  court went on to hold, however, “that is not what the TCPA currently does.” Rather, “in \ncommon parlance, text messages simply are not considered ‘voices,’” and the statute should be \nunderstood by the ordinary meaning of its words. Id.; see also , Soliman v. Subway Franchisee \nAdvertising Fund Trust , Ltd., Case No. 3:19 -cv-592 (July 18, 2022, D. Conn.) (“To be sure . . . \n‘voice’ can also be used metaphorically . . . [b]ut this use is less common and is typically used in \npoetic or literary settings . . . . In normal English, an advertiser’s text messa ge is not its ‘voice.’ ”) \n Soliman  further observed that interpreting “voice” metaphorically “is even less plausible \ngiven that the Act bans ‘prerecorded voices.’ To ‘record’ is ‘[t]o convert (sound or visual scenes, \nesp. television pictures) into permanent  form.’ Record (def. 9c), Oxford English Dictionary. This \ndefinition matches perfectly with the sound sense of ‘voice,’ but not with the metaphorical one.”  \n Risher’s third claim for relief, therefore, fails. Because this dismissal turns on the legal \nconcl usion that the text messages do not fall within the statutory language, it is not a pleading \ndefect  that can be cured by amending to state additional or other facts . Risher has not suggested \notherwise. Accordingly, no leave to amend will be granted.  \n  \n B.  Objection to discovery ruling  \n Risher contends that the magistrate judge has erroneously limited his ability to obtain \ncertain documents from defendants —(1) a representative sample of the dialing lists/logs showing \ntext recipients who may be class members, (2) data and records related to any consent defense, and \n(3) documents showing differences in the text messages. The crux of the dispute appears to be that  \ndefendants have produced only  information  “specific to the text message campaign through which \nPlaintiff received a text message,” whereas Risher wishes to represent “all individuals who were \nsent text messages through Mya’s chat bot promoting Adecco’s jo b placements,” which he insists Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 4 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n5 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  requires discovery into other “campaigns” or candidate lists.  \n The magistrate judge, however, has not permanently closed the door on Risher’s ability to \nobtain further discovery. Rather, in the order Risher challenges, the magistrate judge ruled that \ndefendants had adequately complied with her prior order, Risher’s assertions to the contrary  \nnotwithstanding. The judge then expressly ordered the parties to engage in further meet and confer \ndiscussions regarding, among other things, Risher’s “request for the total number of text \nrecipients.”  \n The order observed that th e parties had failed to “tet her their arguments to the Fourth \nAmended Complaint, ” and that those arguments provided “ no context that identifies the problem \nor suggests a solution. ” Risher’s objection to the ruling insists the magistrate judge failed to \ncond uct any analysis under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26. The record is clear, however, that the magistrate \njudge was appropriately focused on the questions of burden and relevance  as directed by that rule \nboth at the time of the order Risher challenges, and when issuing the  underlying prior order. \nIndeed, the magistrate judge was careful to avoid deciding issues where the parties had not \nprovided sufficient information and clarity to permit a proper Rule 26 analysis. In directing further \nmeet and confer negotiations, the ord er noted, “[i]t is not the court’s job to guess at relevance or \nburden.”  \n In short, Risher has failed to show that the magistrate judge’s ruling was clearly erroneous \nor contrary to law.  His objection is overruled.  \n \n  \n  \n  Case 3:19-cv-05602-RS     Document 177     Filed 11/18/22     Page 5 of 6 \n \nCASE NO.  19-cv-05602 -RS \n6 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  V.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Clearview AI, Inc. Consumer Privacy Litigation, plaintiffs allege that Clearview AI violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by secretly collecting billions of facial images from the internet and using AI algorithms to create a biometric database. Macy’s is accused of using this database to identify individuals in surveillance footage without proper consent as required by BIPA. The court denied Macy’s motion to certify an interlocutory appeal challenging its previous ruling, finding that plaintiffs adequately alleged violations of their biometric privacy rights under BIPA, and that Macy's use of the database was potentially for profit, thus fitting within the claims under BIPA.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the actions of Macy’s in using Clearview AI’s biometric database without proper consent violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) and whether Macy’s had standing to appeal the district court's ruling on the alleged violations.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that there was no contestable question of law to appeal and found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged concrete harm regarding their BIPA claims. Consequently, the court denied Macy's motion for an interlocutory appeal, as it did not meet the requirements under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine a company called Clearview collected photos from all over the internet to create a kind of facial recognition database using AI. Macy's, a retail store, used this database to identify people caught on their security cameras, but without asking those people for permission first. The court said this might be against the law that protects your private biometric information, like your facial features, unless you give permission. Macy's wanted to challenge this in court, but the judge said there's no good reason to let them appeal at this point because the original arguments that the people made were pretty solid according to previous cases. So, the court decided it's not worth an early appeal and will keep the case moving forward.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN DIVISION  \n \n       )   \nIn re Clearview AI, Inc. Consumer Privacy Litig.,  ) Case No. 21- cv-0135 \n       )   \n       ) Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman   \n       ) \n      \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \n \nPlaintiffs brought a first amended consolidated class action complaint in this multi -district \nlitigation alleging claims against defendant retailer Macy’s Retail Holdings, LLC (“Macy’s”) under the \nIllinois Biometric Information Privacy A ct, 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”), along with claims under \nCalifornia and New York law.   On January 27, 2022, the Court granted in part and denied in part \nMacy’s motion to dismiss brought pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) .  \nBefore the Court is Macy’s  motion to certify an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) \nchallenging certain aspects of the  Court’s J anuary 27  ruling.   For the following reasons, the Court , in its \ndiscretion,  denies Macy’s motion.  \nBackgroun d \nThe Court presumes familiarity with its prior rulings in this multi -district litigation , especially \nthe Court’s January 27, 2022 ruling .  Plaintiffs allege that the Clearview defendants covertly scraped \nbillions of photographs of facial images from the int ernet and then used artificial intelligence algorithms \nto scan the face geometry of each individual depicted in the photographs to harvest the individuals’ unique biometric identifiers and corresponding biometric information.  The Clearview defendants then created a searchable database containing plaintiffs’ biometrics that allowed users to identify unknown \nindividuals  by uploading a photograph to the database.   \nDefendant Macy’s is a private corporation that purchased access to the Clearview database and \nthe biometrics contained therein to identify people whose images appeared in surveillance camera Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 1 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n footage from Macy’s retail stores.   Plaintiffs allege that Macy’s is part of the Clearview Client Class, \nwhich they defined as follows:  \nAll non- governmental, pr ivate entities – including publicly -traded companies – who \npurchased access to, or otherwise obtained, the Biometric Database and then utilized \nthe database to run biometric searches at a time when the Biometrics of one or more of \nthe named Plaintiffs had already been captured, collected or obtained, and subsequently \nstored, by the Clearview Defendants . \n \nPlaintiffs contend that there are at least 200 companies in the Clearview Client Class.  \n \nIn their first amended consolidated complaint, plaintiffs bring a BIPA claim against Macy’s \nunder 740 ILCS 14/15(b), which prohibits private entities from collecting, capturing, purchasing, \nreceiving through trade, or otherwise obtaining a person’s biometric identifiers or information without first providing notice and consent.  P laintiffs also bring a BIPA claim under 740 ILCS 14/15(c), which \nprohibits private entities from selling, leasing, trading, or profiting from a person’s biometric identifiers or information.  Further, plaintiffs alle ged statutory and common law claims against Macy’s under \nCalifornia and New York law.  \nLegal Standard  \nThere are four statutory criteria the Court must consider  in order to grant  a § 1292(b) motion: \n(1) there must be a question of law; (2) the question of law must be controlling ; (3) the question of law \nmust be c ontestable ; and (4)  immediate appeal would materially advance the litigation .  Kenosha Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ. v. Whitaker,  841 F.3d 730, 732 ( 7th Cir. 2016) ; Ahrenholz v. Board of Trs. of \nUniv. of Ill., 219 F.3d 674, 675 (7th Cir. 2000) .  “Question of law ” in the context of § 1292(b) goes to \nthe “ meaning of a statutory or constitutional provision, regulation, or common law doctrine .”  \nAhrenholz, 219 F.3d at 676.    Section 1292(b) gives district courts discretion when considering whether \nto certify an interlocutory appeal.   See Breuder v. Board of Trs. of Cmty. College Dist. No. 502, 888 F.3d 266, \n271 (7th Cir. 2018).  In the end, § 1292(b) requests for interlocutory appeal are for exceptional circumstances .  Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis , 519 U.S. 61, 74, 117 S.Ct. 467, 136 L.Ed.2d 437 (1996) . \n Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 2 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n Discussion  \n In the present §  1292(b) motion, Macy’s asks the Court to certify three questions, the first one \nconcerning Article III standing:  “ Whether, in light of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in \nTransUnion , allegations of bare statutory violations of Illinois’ Biometric Inform ation Privacy Act, \nunaccompanied by allegations of actual harm, confer Article III standing .”  There are several reasons \nwhy Macy’s  first question for interlocutory appeal  does not meet §  1292(b)’s  standards , as discussed \ndirectly below.  \n In the  January 2022 ruling, the  Court concluded that “ plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that \ndefendant’s use of their private information without the opportunity to give their consent as required \nunder BIPA 15(b) caused them the concrete harm of violating thei r privacy interests in their biometric \ndata.”  In short, the Court concluded that there were sufficient allegations of actual harm, unlike Macy’s  \ninterlocutory question that there was no actual harm.   Macy’s first question thus distorts the Court’s \napplica tion of the law to the facts.    \nMeanwhile, in concluding plaintiffs sufficiently alleged actual harm  for their BIPA 15(b) claim , \nthe Court relied on the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Bryant v. Compass Group USA, Inc. , 958 F.3d 617, \n627 ( 7th Cir. 2020) .  In Bryant , the Seventh Circuit concluded that the plaintiff had Article III standing \nfor h er BIPA 15(b) claim based on the disclosure of her private information without her consent, and \nthus defendant “ inflicted  the concrete injury BIPA intended to protect against,  i.e. a consumer ’s loss of \nthe power and ability to make informed decisions about the collection, storage, and use of her \nbiometric information.”   Id. at 627.  The Supreme Court’s deci sion in TransUnion , LLC v. Ramirez , 141 \nS.Ct. 2190, 2200 (2021) , bolsters the Bryant  holding  when it held,  “[v]arious intangible harms can also be \nconcrete” including “reputational harms, disclosure of private information, and intrusion upon \nseclusion.”  Id.  at 2204.   \nNevertheless, Macy’s argues that T ransUnion  stands for the proposition that a victim of a privacy \nharm can only suffer an injury -in-fact for Article III standing  if the  victim’s  information is disseminated Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 3 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n to a third -party .  The TransUnion  decision does not support this proposition.  Instead, in the  context of \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), the TransUnion  Court concluded that  certain  class members \nwhose credit reports were not disseminated to third parties did not suffer a concrete injury -in-fact, \nkeeping in mind that “history and tradition offer a meaningful guide to the types of cases that Article \nIII empowers federal courts to consider.”   Id. at 2204.  As the TransUnion  Court clarified , “with respect \nto the concrete -harm requirement in particular, this Court ’s opinion in Spokeo v. Robins  indicated that \ncourts should assess whether the alleged injury to the plaintiff has a ‘close relationship’ to a harm \n‘traditionally’ recognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts” and that  this “inquiry \nasks whether plaintiffs have identified a close  historical  or common- law analogue for their asserted \ninjury.”  Id .  In TransUnion , the Supreme Court analogized the FCRA violations to the tort of \ndefamation , which requires that the defamatory statement be published to a third party.  Id . at 2209.  \nThus, the plaintiffs whose reports were not disseminated to third parties did not allege a concrete \ninjury -in-fact under the FCRA.  \nHere, the Seventh Circuit analogized  BIPA violations to common law privacy torts, which are \ndifferent common law torts than  defamation .  See Fox v. Dakkota Integrated Sys ., LLC,  980 F.3d 1146, \n1153 ( 7th Cir. 2020) ; Bryant , 958 F.3d at 627.  As the Bryant  court held:  “ Bryant was asserting a \nviolation of her own rights —her fingerprints, her private information—and that this is enough to show \ninjury -in-fact without further tangible consequences.   This was no bare procedural violation; it was an \ninvasion of her private domain, much like an act of trespass would be.  Id . at 624.  Accordingly, t he \nSupreme Court’s FCRA ruling in TransUnion  does not change the Seventh Circuit ’s BIPA  precedent.  \nIn the end, there is no contestable question of law  to appeal because under Seventh Circuit \nprecedent , a plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a BIPA 15(b) claim based on the harm associated with the \ninvasion of plaintiff’s private information.  See Bryant , 958 F.3d at 619 (“ a failure to follow section 15(b) \nof the law leads to an  invasion of personal rights that is both concrete  and particularized.” ).  Therefore, \nthe Court denies Macy’s motion in this respect.  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 4 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n Next, Macy’s seeks to certify the following question for interlocutory appeal:  “ Whether, as a \nmatter of law, a company’s use of a biometric database for loss prevention suffices to allege ‘ profit ’ \nunder Section 15(c) of BIPA. ”  To recap, a violation of BIPA 15(c) occurs when private entit ies “sell, \nlease, trade, or otherwise profit from a person ’s or a customer ’s biometric identifier or biometric \ninformation.”   Macy’s second question does not involve a question of law as required under §  1292(b) \nbecause the Court did not construe the statu tory meaning of “ profit ” under BIPA 15(c), which would \nhave amounted to a question of law for §  1292(b) purposes.  See Ahrenholz, 219 F.3d at 676; see, e.g., \nDrnek v. City of Chicago , 205 F.Supp.2d 894, 900 (N.D. Ill. 2002) (Bucklo, J.) .  Rather , the Court  \naddressed the parties’ arguments w hether plaintiffs  had plausibly alleged Macy’s profit ed from plaintiffs’ \nbiometric information.   \nTo explain, in the January 2022 ruling, the Cour t concluded that plaintiffs  plausibly alleged that  \nMacy’s used their biometric information for its own  business purposes and profited from its use .  From \nthese allegations, the Court stated that  “it is reasonable to infer that plaintiffs’ biometric information \nwas necessary to Macy ’s loss prevention business model and that this biometric information generated \nprofits by reducing the number of stolen goods. ”  Macy’s disagreement with how the Court applied the \nfacts as alleged to BIPA 15(c) is not grounds for an interlocutory appeal.  See 880 S. Rohlwing Road, LLC \nv. T&C Gymnastics, LLC , No. 16- cv-7650, 2017 WL 264504, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 19, 2017) (St. Eve, J.) \n(“If a mere disagreement in how the law is applied to the facts of a particular case was all that was \nneeded for an interlocutory appeal,” … “every single denial of a motion to dismiss would present \ngrounds for interlocutory appeal.”)  (citation omitted) .  The Court denies Macy’s motion in this respect.  \nLast, Macy’s asks the Court to certify a question in relation to plai ntiffs’ California and New \nYork claims, namely, “w hether California and New York statutes and common law protect the same set \nof rights secured by BIPA. ”  Specifically, Macy’s contends plaintiffs are trying to extend BIPA to other \nstates.  In making this argument, Macy’s ignores the Cour t’s consideration of the alleged facts in the \ncontext of the California’s Unfair Competition Law, California’s commercial misappropriation of Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n \nlikeness statute , the California common law right to publicity , and the righ t to privacy under the \nCalifornia Constitution.  Also, the Court consider ed the well -pleaded all egations in the context of New \nYork’s Civil Rights Act § 51.   \nAt no point did the Court consider or conclude that plaintiffs’ California and New York claims \nprotected the same set of  rights secured by BIPA —nor did plaintiffs make this argument in their briefs .  \nAs such, Macy’s contention that plaintiffs’ New York and California claims are really BIPA claims  \nincognito is not a question of law for interlocutory appeal.  See Lukis v. Whitepages Inc. , 542 F.Supp.3d \n831, 844 (N.D. Ill. 2020) (Feinerman, J.) (“ the question of law must be a ‘pure’ question of law, \n‘something the court of appeals could decide quickly and cleanly without having to study the record. ’”) \n(citation omitted).  \nConclusion  \n For the foregoing reasons,  the Court , in its discretion, denies Macy’s motion to certify an \ninterlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) [ 283]. \nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \nDate:  3/18/2022   \n      Entered: _____________________________ \n         SHARON JOHNSON COLEMAN \n         United States District Judge  Case: 1:21-cv-00135 Document #: 314 Filed: 03/18/22 Page 6 of 6 PageID #:<pageID>",

R. 21 -1 ¶¶ 1, 16. The App uses artificial intelligence to extract a person’s face \nfrom a photo and transform it to look like a cartoon.  Id. ¶¶ 8, 34.  Plaintiffs are Illinois \ncitizens  who are users of the App . Id. ¶¶ 8, 14 –15. Plaintiffs allege that Wemagine \nviolates BIPA by collect ing, storing, and disclosing the facial geometry and biometric Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 1 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n data of Voila users  without their consent . Id. ¶¶ 8–10, 12– 13, 24, 33, 39, 43 –46, 51–\n53, 58– 60, 76 –78, 87 –88.  \nAfter this C ourt dismiss ed the original Complaint  for lack of personal \njurisdiction on January 26, 2022 (R. 19), it granted Plaintiffs ’ motion for leave to file \nan Amended Complaint  (R. 22). The Amended Complaint is di stinct  from the original  \nComplaint in two  notable  ways: first, it includes allegations regarding a second \nnamed plaintiff, Shannon Ross, who downloaded Voila  in Illinois and paid $29.99 for \nan annual Voila Pro subscription.  R. 21 -1 ¶¶  28–29, 32– 33, 55– 56. Second, the \nAmen ded Complaint alleges the App derive s substantial revenue from nearly 5,000 \nIllinois -based users due to subscription fees and its  display of third- party  advertising  \nto “free”  users.  Id. ¶¶ 18, 26–27, 31, 33, 50. Wemagine filed a  motion to dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ Amended Complaint, arguing again  that this Court lacks  personal  \njurisdiction over Wemagine  and that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim . R. 24.  \nAnalysis  \n Plaintiffs’ additions  to the Amended Complaint  do not  salvage their claims, \nand the  Amended Complaint must again be dismissed for  many of the same reasons \nthis Court identified  in its Opinion granting Wemagine’s first motion to dismiss . See \nR. 19.  Courts may assert specific jurisdiction where (1) the defendan t has \npurposefully directed [its] activities at the forum state or purposefully availed [itself] \nof the privilege of conducting business in that state, and (2) the alleged injury arises \nout of the defendant's forum -related activities.” N. Grain Mktg., LLC v. Greving , 743 Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 2 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n F.3d 487, 492 (7th Cir. 2014) (citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, \n472 (1985)).  \nHere, Plaintiffs first argue that this Court has specific personal jurisdiction \nover Wemagine because, in addition to down loading and using Voila  in Illinois,  \nPlaintiff Gutierrez and other Illinois users of the free version are subject to  third -\nparty  advertising during their  use of the App . This, Plaintiffs contend,  generates  \nrevenue for Wemagine in Illinois . However , “advert isements or solicitation of \nbusiness is not enough to sustain personal jurisdiction in Illinois .” Linehan v. Golden \nNugget , 2008 WL 4181743, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 5, 2008) (citing Crum & Forster \nSpecialty  Ins. Co. v. Extended Stay America, Inc. , 873 N.E.2d 964 (Ill. App. Ct. 1st. \n2007)) ; see also Congdon v. Cheapcarribbean.com, Inc. , 2017 WL 5069960, at *7 (N.D. \nIll. Nov. 3, 2017) (no personal jurisdiction whe re solicitation, advertising, and  sales \nwere not conducted with any specificity to Illinois).  Like Congdon, here there is no \nevidence that Wemagine  purposefully directed any of its conduct toward Illinois, did \nany Illinois -specific shipping, marketing or advertising, or sought out the Illinois \nmarket in any way. Plaintiffs also do not  allege that  the advertisements shown to free \nusers in Illinois wer e for Illinois companies  or for Wemagine itself .  \nFurther, Plaintiffs do not allege that their injur ies arose out of the  third- party \nadvertis ements . Plaintiffs’ extensive citation of Keiken v. Music Corp, of America, \nInc., 1993 WL 280818 (N.D. Ill. July 26, 1993),  is erroneous because the court there \nlater overruled the  holding on which Plaintiff relies.  1994 WL 11617, at *2 (N.D. Ill. \nJan. 3, 1994) . On reconsideration, the Keiken court found that the plaintiff’s injury at  Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 3 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n a Florida theme park did not “arise out of ” the defendant’s Illinois advertisements \nbecause the plaintiff never saw the advertisements. Id. This holding conformed to  the \nsubstantial jurisprudence in Illinois  that advertisements  without a causal nexus to \nthe injury can not provide a basis for  personal jurisdiction. Id.1 In this case, too, \nWemagine’s alleged violation of BIPA did not arise out of  the third -party \nadvertisements  in question, which  only appear ed to users after the Ap p had already \nbeen downloaded, and were  not designed to encourage users  to download or use the \nApp.  Instead,  the alleged harm was occasioned by Gutierrez’s own conduct of \ndownloading and using the App.  As this Court has discussed, courts “should be \ncareful  in resolving questions about personal jurisdiction involving online contacts to \nensure that a defendant is not haled into court simply because the defendant owns or \noperates [an interactive] website that is accessible in the forum state.” Matlin v. Spin \nMaster Corp. , 921 F.3d 701, 706 (7th Cir. 2019) (quoting Illinois v. Hemi Group  LLC, \n622 F.3d 754, 760 (7th C ir. 2010)). The refore, Plaintiff Gutierrez’s alleged basis of \nasserting personal jurisdiction via third party advertisement revenue fails.  \n \n1 Plaintiffs’ other authorities on this point are distinguishable for the same \nreasons. That is , the defendants in those cases specifically targeted  their marketing \nactivities to the forum states . See, e.g. , Doffing v. Meta Platforms, Inc. , Case No. 1:22 -\ncv-00100- CL, 2022 WL 3357698 , at * 4–5 (D. Or. July 20, 2022) ( court had personal \njurisdiction over app designer where it entered contracts with forum residents, sent \nthousands of communications to forum users, tracked and broadcasted user  locations, \nand provided location -based recommendations) ; Boone v. Sulphur Creek Resort, Inc. , \n749 F. Supp. 195, 199– 200 (S.D. Ind. 1990) (“Of primary importance . . . is the \nevidence that the Resort made the residents of [the forum state] specific targets  of \nthe Resort’s advertising . . .”) . Additionally, the advertisements had some sort of \ncausal connect ion to the purported claims. See, e.g. , Walker v. Carnival Cruise Lines, \nInc., 681 F. Supp. 470, 474 (N.D. Ill. 1987) (passenger’s injury on cruise ship arose \nout of cruise company’s advertising activities where passenger asserted that the company’s marketing  in the forum cause d her to book the cruise) . Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 4 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n  Neither does the allegation that  Plaintiff Ross paid for the Pro version of the \nApp in Illinois  establish  specific personal jurisdiction . The plaintiff cannot be the sole \nlink between a defendant and the forum. Kosar v. Columbia Sussex Management, \nLLC, 2021 WL 5356753, *6 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 16, 2021) (quoting Rogers v. City of Hobart , \n996 F.3d 812, 819 (7th Cir. 2021)). Again , the alleged injury must arise from the \ndefendant’s contacts with Illinois. See Kosar, 2021 WL 5356753 at *6.  \nIn be2 LLC v. Ivanov , Illinois residents accessed and created profiles on an \nonline dating site, but there was no evidence that the site targeted the Illinois market. \n642 F.3d 555, 559 (7th  Cir. 2011) (“ If the defendant merely operates a website, even \na ‘highly interactive ’ website, that is accessible from, but does not target, the forum \nstate, then the defendant may not be haled into court in that state without offending the Constitution. ”). Similarly, though Plaintiff Ross downloaded and paid for the Pro \nversion of Voila in Illinois, there is no evidence that Wemagine purposefully direct ed \nthe subscription toward Illinois  in a way that Wemagine availed itself of the privilege \nof doing business in the state. Id.  Like an interactive website, a ny alleged harm here \nwas occasioned by Plaintiff Ross’s own interaction with Voila —downloading and \naccessing  the App and then uploading his photo —rather than the Defendant’s specific \nactions in this jurisdiction. Matlin , 921 F.3d at  706; see also Breschia v. Paradise \nVacation Cl ub, Inc. , 2003 WL 22872128, at *3 (N.D.  Ill. Dec.4, 2003)  (dismissing for \nlack of personal jurisdiction where the only connection to the forum was that the \nplaintiff accessed the defendant ’s website to make and pay for a hotel reservation in \nthe forum ).   Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 5 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n Plaintiffs cite Huston v. Hearst Communications, Inc.  to support their claim \nthat subscriptions purchased in Illinois are enough to support personal jurisdiction; \nhowever, the court in Huston established that “personal jurisdiction also exists over \n[the defendant]  because it conducts subs tantial business within Illinois and has \nsignificant, continuous, and pervasive contacts in Illinois,” through the sale  and \nshipping  of physical products  to Illinois customers . 2022 WL 385176, at *1 (C.D. Ill. \nFeb. 7, 2022).  That is not true in this case . Plaintiffs’ other authorities are inapposite \nfor the same reason. See, e.g.,  King v. PeopleNet Corp., No. 21 CV 2774, 2021 WL \n5006692, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2021) ( defendan t shipped devices to Illinois  \ncustomers  for storage of biomet ric data ); Monster Energy Co. v. Wensheng , 136 F. \nSupp. 3d 897, 905 (N.D. Ill. 2015)  (defendants affirmatively creat ed a shipping option  \non their  website  to ship counterfeit  goods to Illinois); Trio v. Turing Video, Inc. , Case \nNo. 1:21- cv-04409, 2022 WL 4466050 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 26, 2022) (defendant executed \nnumerous “purchase orders with Illinois customers for sale and shipment of [COVID -\n19 screening equipment].”) .2 \nEven as replead, the Amended Complaint still fails to establish this Court’s \njurisdiction over Wemagine  as to Plaintiffs’ BIPA claims . The Amended Complaint \nmust be dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction. Thus, the  Court need not consider \nwhether Plaintiffs failed to state  a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) .  \n \n2 Plaintiffs cite to Ronquillo v. Doctor’s Assocs., LLC , 2022 WL 1016600  (N.D. Ill. \n2022)  in their supplemental authority. But that case considered a different question : \nwhether BIPA could be applied to residents outside Illinois, or whether the claims \nwere barred by the extraterritoriality doctrine. Id. at *4. Even so, there, the plaintiff’s \nbiometric data was collected and stored on -site in Illinois. Id. Case: 1:21-cv-05702 Document #: 32 Filed: 10/07/22 Page 6 of 7 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n \nConclusion  \n For the reasons set forth above, Wemagine’s motion to dismiss the Amended \nComplaint for lack of personal jurisdiction, R. 24, is granted. This dismissal will be  \nwith out prejudice  as to any forum where personal jurisdiction  actually  exists .  \n       \n \n      ENTERED:  \n \n \n       __________________________________ \n      Honorable Thomas M.

    "summary": "1. **Summary:**\n   In the court case of Sandra Trio vs. Turing Video, Inc., the plaintiff, Sandra Trio, individually and on behalf of others, alleges that Turing Video violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting, storing, and disseminating biometric data without proper consent. The case involves the use of Turing Shield, an AI-integrated kiosk, which scans users' facial geometry and performs temperature screenings. The Court denied Turing’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, allowing the case to proceed.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:**\n   The central legal issue is whether Turing Video, Inc. violated BIPA by collecting, storing, and disseminating biometric information without obtaining informed written consent from users, including the plaintiff, and whether such actions warrant legal action.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:**\n   The Court held that the plaintiff’s claims can proceed, as Turing Video's arguments for dismissal, including jurisdictional challenges and defenses related to federal preemption by the Labor Management Relations Act and the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, were not sufficient to warrant dismissal at this stage. The plaintiff adequately alleged violations under BIPA, and the Court found that it had specific personal jurisdiction over Turing Video.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:**\n   Imagine you work at a store that uses a machine to check your temperature and see if you're wearing a mask. That machine also takes a picture of your face and stores it without telling you or asking for permission. Sandra, who worked at a store using this machine, is upset because she believes the company didn't follow the rules about protecting her personal biometric data. She took the company to court to stop them from using her data without permission. The judge said Sandra's concern is serious enough to go to trial, telling the company they have to face the lawsuit and respond to Sandra's claims.",
    "full_text": "1 IN THE  UNITED  STATES  DISTRICT  COURT  FOR  THE  \nNORTHERN  DISTRICT  OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN  DIVISION  \n \n \nSANDRA TRIO , individually and on behalf  ) \nof all others similarly situated,    ) \n     ) Plaintiff,     ) Case No. 1:21 -cv-04409  \n) \nv.      )  Judge John Robert Blakey  \n) \nTURING VIDEO, INC.,    ) \n  ) \nDefendant.     ) \n  \nMEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER  \nPlaintiff Sandra Trio filed this putative class action lawsuit in state court \nalleging that Defendant Turing Video, Inc. (“Turing”) violated the Illinois Biometric \nInformation Privacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 ILCS 14/1 et seq.  when it collected, stored, and \ndisseminated Plaintiff’s bi ometric information.  [1 -1].  Invoking  jurisdiction under the \nClass Action Fairness Act (“CAFA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d), [1], Turing removed the \nlawsuit to this Court and now seeks dismissal of Plaintiff’s complaint pursuant to \nRules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), and 12(b)(6) , [27].  For the reasons explained below, the Court \ndenies Turing’s motion  [27].   \nI. Facts  \nThe following facts are taken from Plaintiff’s complaint, [ 1-1], and are assumed \nto be true for purposes of Turing’s amended  motion to dismiss , [27] .   \nDefendant Turing Video, Inc. , a California corporation with its principal place \nof business in California,  sells products integrated with artificial intelligence , which Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 1 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>2 provide security and health solutions to companies across an array of industries.  Id.  \n¶¶ 1, 25.  Specific to this lawsuit , Turing produces and sells various technologies  that \nallow business es to safeguard their employees and customers and assist them in \ncomplying with COVID -19 restrictions.  Id. ¶ 2.  Chief among these products is the \nTuring Shield, a kiosk that allows Turing’s customers to screen their employees for \nCOVID -19.  Id. ¶¶ 3, 42.    \nThe Turing Shield works by scanning the biometric data of its u sers.  Id. ¶ 42.  \nFirst, t he Turing Shield prompts a user to complete a health questionnaire on the \nuser’s phone.  Id. ¶ 4.  Once the user completes the questionnaire, a QR code appears \non the user’s phone that the Turing Shield  then scans to initiate a te mperature \nscreening.  Id.   To collect a temperature screening , users stand in front of the Turing \nShield’s camera , which  collects the user’s facial geometry and signals an alert when \nthe Turing Shield’s “artificial intelligence algorithm” recognizes the user .  Id. ¶ 5.  \nFrom there, the algorithm locates the user’s forehead and signals the Turing Shield’s built -in thermal se nsor to collect the user’s forehead temperature.  Id.   The Turing \nShield’s facial recognition software can  also detect whether the user is wearing a \nmask.  Id.  The Turing Shield then stores the data collected from the COVID -19 \nscreening in the Turing data base,  which can store up to  20 million “faces.”  Id.  ¶ 6.   \nAfter the  Turning Shield collects and stores a user’s  data in its  database, it \nanalyzes the data it collected to determine if the user passed the COVID -19 screening \nprocess .  Id. ¶ 7.  If the user  provided satisfactory results for the health questionnaire, \ntemperature screening, and mask detection, then the Turing Shield prints a badge Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 2 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>3 that indicates the user is cleared to enter the work environment.  Id.   For a negative \nscreening result , the Turing Shield print s a badge indicating the user has failed the \nscreening.  Id.    \nTuring’s databases store t he individuals’ facial geometry scans, along with the \nusers ’ temperature, health questionnaire responses, and face mask detection results, \nto track and report individuals who may have been exposed to COVID -19.  Id.  ¶ 43.  \nTuring’s customers can access the data collected by the Turing Shield by subscribing \nto Turing’s Data Access Management Platform, a software program that provides \nTuring’s cus tomers with centralized monitoring and reporting to identify users of the \nTuring Shield who may have been exposed to COVID -19.  Id.  ¶ 8.  The software \nprogram is cloud- based, which means data collected and obtained from the Turing \nShield is transmitted to  Turing ’s servers and other third parties who host that data \nsuch as  Amazon Web Services.  Id.  ¶ 44.  Turing  accesses its servers for various \npurposes , including support services for its customers .  Id.  ¶ 45.   \nFrom  April 2019 to June 2021, Plaintiff worked  as a cake decorator for New \nAlbertson’s, Inc. d/b/a Jewel -Osco at a location  in Algonquin, Illinois.  Id.  ¶ 53.   While \nemployed by Jewel -Osco, Plaintiff was required to use the Turing Shield each time \nshe began her workday  as part of the store’s COVID -19 screening process.  Id.  ¶¶ 54, \n56.  Turing stored the biometric data obtained from Plaintiff’s use of the Turing Shield \nin its databases , and later disseminated it to third  parties such as Amazon Web \nServices .  Id.  ¶¶ 55, 63.  Turing never inform ed Plaintiff of any limits on the purpose  \nof using such information or about any  limits  on the length of time for which Turing Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 3 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>4 would collect, store, use, and disseminate her biometric data.  Id. ¶ 57.  Plaintiff was \nnever provided wit h, nor did she ever sign, a written release authorizing  Turing to \ncollect, store, use, or disseminate her biometric data.  Id.  ¶ 58.  \nOn July 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit  in Illinois state court , alleging that \nTuring violated Section 15(b) of BIPA when it failed to obtain her informed written \nconsent and release prior to collecting her biometric identifiers and biometric \ninformation (Count I) and violated Section 15(d) of BIPA when it disseminated  her \nbiometric identif iers and biometric information to third  parties without first \nobtaining her consent (Count II) .  Id. ¶¶ 78 –87, 88– 96.  Plaintiff, individually and on \nbehalf of a class of all other individuals in Illinois who had their biometric data \ncollected, stored, use d, and disseminated by Turing, seek  declaratory and equitable \nrelief, statutory damages, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and other expenses provided \nfor under BIPA.  Id.  ¶¶ 68, 87, 96.   \nAfter timely removing this lawsuit to this Court o n August 18, 2021, [ 1], Turing  \nmoves to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1), 12(b)(2), and 12(b)(6) \nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, [27].  \nII. Legal Standard  \nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) challenges the Court’s subject matter \njurisdiction.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  If a defendant challenges the  facial  sufficiency \nof the allegations regarding subject matter jurisdiction , the Court must accept as true \nall well- pled factual allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in the p laintiff’s \nfavor.  Apex Digital, Inc. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co. , 572 F.3d 440, 443- 44 (7th Cir. 2009).  Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 4 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>5 But where the complaint is “facially sufficient but external facts call the court’s \njurisdiction into question, we ‘may properly look beyond the jurisdict ional allegations \nof the complaint and view whatever evidence has been submitted on the issue to \ndetermine whether in fact subject matter jurisdiction exists.’”  Taylor v. McCament , \n875 F.3d 849, 853 (7th Cir. 2017) (quoting Apex Digital, Inc. , 572 F.3d at  444)).   \nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) challenges the Court’s personal \njurisdiction over a defendant.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  Under Rule 12(b)(2), a  \ncomplaint need not include facts alleging personal jurisdiction ; but once the \ndefendant moves to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(2), the plaintiff bears the \nburden of demonstrating the existence of jurisdiction.  Purdue Research Found. v. \nSanofi -Synthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, 782 ( 7th Cir. 2003).  Where, as here, the Court  \nrules on a Rule 12(b)(2) motion with out an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff need \nonly establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction.  Curry v. Revolution Labs., \nLLC, 949 F.3d 385, 392- 93 (7th Cir. 2020) ; GCIU -Employer Ret. Fund v. Goldfarb \nCorp. , 565 F.3d 1018, 1023 (7th Cir. 2009).  Where  the defendant  “has submitted \naffidavits or other evidence in opposition to the exercise of jurisdiction,” however, “the plaintiff must go beyond the pleadings and submit affirmative evidence supporting \nthe exer cise of jurisdiction.”  Purdue  Research Found. , 338 F.3d at 783.  T he Court \naccepts as true any facts in affidavits that do not conflict with the complaint or the plaintiff’s submissions,  Curry , 949 F.3d at 393, but the Court must resolve any \ndisputes concerning the relevant facts in the plaintiff’s favor.  Purdue  Research \nFound. , 338 F.3d at 782– 83.   Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 5 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>6 A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) challenges the sufficiency of the \ncomplaint.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must allege  \n“sufficient factual matter” to “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  \nAshcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007) ).  A claim has facial plausibility “when the pleaded factual \ncontent allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable \nfor the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (citing Twombly , 550 U.S. at 556).  \nIn evaluating the c omplaint, this Court draws all reasonable inferences in the \nplaintiff’s favor and accepts  as true  all well- pled allegations; the Court need not, \nhowever, accept legal conclusions or conclusory allegations.  McCauley v. City of Chi ., \n671 F.3d 611, 616 (7th Cir. 2011) ( citing  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 681).  Unlike motions to \ndismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(2), however, the Court may not consider \nmatters outside of the pleadings.  See Geinosky v. City of Chi. , 675 F.3d 743, 746 n.1 \n(7th Cir. 2012) (“A motion u nder Rule 12(b)(6) can be based only on the complaint \nitself, documents attached to the complaint, documents that are critical to the \ncomplaint and referred to in it, and information that is subject to proper judicial \nnotice.”).   \nIII. Analysis  \nTuring move s to dismiss Plaintiff’s complaint : under Rule 12(b)(1), arguing \nthat her claims  are preempted under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations \nAct (“LMRA”) , [28] at 8– 12; under Rule 12(b)(2), arguing that the Court lacks \npersonal jurisdiction over it ; and under Rule 12(b)(6) on the basis that Plaintiff’s Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 6 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>7 claims are barred by Illinois’ extraterritoriality doctrine and the federal Public \nReadiness and Emergency Preparedness Act , and that the  complaint fails to state a \nclaim under BIP A, id. at 5–19.  As “a federal court has leeway ‘to choose among \nthreshold grounds for denying audience to a case on the merits,’” Sinochem Intern. \nCo. Ltd. v. Malaysia Intern. Shipping Corp. , 549 U.S. 422, 431 (2007) (quoting \nRuhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil. C o., 526 U.S. 574, 585 (1999), the  Court first considers \nits personal jurisdiction over Turing and then turns to the issue of subject -matter \njurisdiction .      \nA. Personal Jurisdiction  \n \nA federal court sitting in diversity may exercise personal jurisdiction over a \ndefendant if authorized by the forum state’s long -arm statute and the United States \nConstitution.  Felland v. Clifton , 682 F.3d 665, 672 (7th Cir. 2012).  Illinois’ long arm \nstatute provides that a court may also exercise jurisdiction “ on any basis now or \nhereafter permitted by the Illinois Constitution and the Constitution of the United \nStates.”  735 ILCS 5/2- 209(c).  Because the Seventh Circuit has found no “operative \ndifference” between the two constitutional limits, this Court will limit its analysis to whether exercising jurisdiction over Turing comports with the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  Illinois v. Hemi Group LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 756– 57 (7th \nCir. 2010).    \nUnder well -established law, the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over \nnonresidents only when they have “minimum contacts” with Illinois such that \nlitigating the case here “does not offend traditional notions of fair play and Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 7 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>8 substantial justice. ”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. Washington , 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945).  There \nare two types of personal jurisdiction, general jurisdiction and specific jurisdiction.   \nGeneral jurisdiction exists when the defendant’s affiliations with the forum \nstate “are so constant and pervasive as to render [it] essentially at home” there.  \nDaimler AG v. Bauman , 571 U.S. 117, 122 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nFor a corporation, this encompasses the state of its incorporation or the state where \nit maintains its principa l place of business.  Id. at 139.  Here, Plaintiff has not shown  \nthat this Court may exercise general jurisdiction over Turing  because the complaint \nalleges that Turing’s place of incorporation and principal place of business is in \nCalifornia, [1 -1] ¶ 25, and Turing’s unrebutted evidence demonstrates that Turing \nlacks the “continuous and systematic contacts as to render it essentially home” in \nIllinois , Daimler AG, 571 U.S. at 139 (cleaned up);  see also [28-1].1  Thus, the Court \ncannot exercise general personal jurisdiction  over Turing  based upon the record \nbefore it.       \nThe next type of personal jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction, depends upon the \nfacts of the case and exists when a  defendant has “purposefully directed his activities \nat residents of the forum” and “the litigation results from alleged injuries that arise \nout of or relate to those activities.”  Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, \n472–73 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted) ; see also Bristol -Myers Squibb Co. \nv. Sup erior Ct. of California , 137 S. Ct. 1773, 1781 (2017) .  (“[T]here must be ‘an \n \n1 The parties submitted extrinsic evidence relevant  to the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction over Turing, \nwhich the Court considers solely for Turing’s Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss.  See Purdue  Research \nFound. , 338 F.3d at 782 ; Curry , 949 F.3d at 393.   Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 8 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>9 affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, an activity \nor an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the \nState’ s regulation.”) (quoting Goodyear  Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown , 564 \nU.S. 915, 919 (2011)).   A c ourt’s  specific jurisdiction inquiry  must focus  on the \n“’relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation, ’—the ‘‘essential \nfoundation’  of specific jurisdiction.”  Ford Motor Co. v. Montana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct. , \n141 S. Ct. 1017, 1028 (2021) ( quoting  Helicopteros Nacionales de Columbia, S.A. v. \nHall, 466 U.S. 408, 414 (1984)).  As part of this process , the Court first determine s \nwhether  the evidence demonstrates Turing has sufficient contacts with Illinois  and \nwhether those contacts “arise out of or relate to” Plaintiff’s claims.  See Walden v. \nFiore, 571 U.S. 277, 286 (2014) (“Due process requires that a defendant be haled into  \ncourt in a forum State based on his own affiliation with the State.”).    \nAs an initial matter, Turing argues that this Court does not have specific \njurisdiction because Turing, a non- forum resident, sold the Turing Shields that relate \nto Plaintiff’s injuries to Albertsons, Plaintiff’s employer (and a non -forum resident), \nand that Albertsons brought the Turing Shi elds it purchased from Turing into Illinois \nwithout discussion or prior notification to Turing.  [28] at 12.  In support of its Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss, Turing submits the declaration of Xing Zhong, Turing’s \nCo-Founder and Chief Operating Officer, [28-1].  Zhong states that Albertsons is one \nof Turing’s customers, and the two  entered into a contractual relationship on April 4, \n2020,  whereby Albertson bought Turing ’s Turing Shield k iosks to mitigate the spread \nof COVID -19 at Albertsons’  stores .  Id.  ¶ 13.  Turing does not  otherwise have a Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 9 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>10 contractual relationship with Jewel -Osco.  Id.  Zhong also avers  that Turing is not \nregistered to do business in Illinois, does not maintain offices, property, or bank \naccounts in Illinois, did not purposely target Illinois in the marketing and sales of \nTuring’s products, and that of its 121 employees, 82 are based in California and only \ntwo are in Illinois, both of whom were hired after  Plaintiff fi led this  lawsuit.  Id.  ¶¶ \n13–14.  With respect to Albertsons, Zhong states that Albertsons  only communicated  \nwith Turing ’s California -based  employees, that Turing sold Albertsons the Turing \nShield outside of Illinois, and that the two companies never met or developed a \nbusiness relationship in Illinois, had no specific agreement about deploying or \nservicing the Turing Shield in Illinois, and had no discussions about whether  \nAlbertsons would use  the Turing Shields in Illinois.  Id.  ¶ 15.   \nIn opposition to T uring’s Rule 12(b)(2) motion, Plaintiff submits Turing’s \nresponses to Plaintiff’s Interrogatories, [ 35-3], and dozens of purchase orders  \ninvolving the sale or shipment of  Turing Shields to customers  in Illinois , [37-2].  Both \nparties also submit excerpts of a transcript from Zhong’s deposition taken on the issue \nof personal jurisdiction.  [37 -1]; [43 -1].  The evidence demonstrates that, since Spring \n2020,  Turing ha d at least 30 customers in Illinois during the relevant period and that \nthe purchase  orders confirm it sold and shipped Turing Shields to customers in \nIllinois  on various occasions .  [35 -3] at 7–8; [37-1] at 42:10– 24, 58:12 –15, 104:12– 21; \n[37-2]; [43 -1] at  42:10– 24, 58:12– 15, 104:12 –21, 104:16 –105:2 .  In fact, one purchase \norder indicates  that Turing may have sold 106 Turing Shields to an Illinois -based Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 10 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>11 customer for nearly $366,000.00 and the 106 Turing Shields were  to be shipped to an \nIllinois address.  [37 -2] at 7 –8.   \nOverall, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s proffered evidence demonstrates that \nTuring has the requisite minimum contacts with Illinois for purposes of specific \npersonal jurisdiction.2  While Turing insists that the Court cannot assert jurisdiction \nover it because Turing has no  physica l presence in the state,   see [28] at 11; [43] at 9 , \n“physical presence is not necessary for a defendant to have sufficient minimum \ncontacts with a forum state ,” Curry , 949 F.3d at 398.  Rather, the existence of \nminimum  contacts with the forum state turns on whether the defendant has \n“purposefully directed his activities”  to the forum.   Id. (quoting Burger King , 471 U.S. \nat 476).  In other words, t he “inquiry boils down to this: has [Turing] purposely \nexploited the Illinois market?”  be2 LLC v. Ivanov , 642 F.3d 555, 558 ( 7th Cir. 2011).  \nThe record here demonstrates that Turing has  done so.  Turing  has at least 30 \ncustomers in Illinois and executed purchase orders with Illinois customers for the \n \n2  The parties quibble over the relevance of certai n facts that occurred after  Plaintiff brought suit, such \nas Turing’s hiring of two Illinois -based employees and Turing sending its employees to conferences \nhosted in Illinois.  The Seventh Circuit has not addressed whether a court should consider  a \ndefendant’s contacts with the forum state that occurred after the filing of the lawsuit , but several \ndistrict courts have reasoned that post -filing conduct cannot provide defendants with the “fair \nwarning” required under the due process analysis for spe cific jurisdiction.  See, e.g., United \nPhosphorus, Ltd. v . Angus Chemical Co. , 43 F. Supp.2d 904, 911 (N.D. Ill. 1999) (“While pre -suit \nactivities may rise to the level of a ‘fair warning’ that a defendant may be haled into a court in the \nforum state, post -suit activities cannot serve to warn the defendant of an event that has already \noccurred.”); Haggerty Enterprises, Inc. v. Lipan Indus. Co. , No. 00 C 766, 2001 WL 968592, at *4 (N.D. \nIll. Aug. 23, 2001) (declining to consider facts that occurred after the  filing of the complaint “because \njurisdiction is generally determined by facts existing at the case filing.”); NTE LLC v. Kenny \nConstruction Company , No. 14 C 9558, 2015 WL 6407532, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 15, 2015)  (“[P]ost -filing \ncontacts cannot serve the  Due Process purpose of the minimum contacts doctrine —that is, they cannot \ngive the defendant fair warning that he could be ‘haled into court in the forum state’ before the lawsuit is filed.”).  The Court need not decide this issue now  because  Turing has s ufficient pre -suit contacts \nwith Illinois notwithstanding any contacts it may have had with the state after  Plaintiff filed her \nlawsuit.  Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 11 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>12 sale and shipment of Turing Shields.  Thus, Turing’s contacts with Illinois are  not \nthe result of “random, fortuitous, or attenuated”  circumstances  or due to the \n“unilateral activity of another party or third person,” Curry , 949 F.3d at 396, but \nindicate  Turing engaged in commercial activity purposefully directed at  Illinois \nsufficient  to hale it  into Illinois  courts.  See id. at 398 (“[S]uch  ‘purposeful direction’ \nmay be shown by evidence that the defendant’s actions, even if initiated outside of \nthe forum state, nevertheless were directed at the forum state.  For example, a \ndefendant may cause its product to be distributed in the forum state .”); Logan Prods ., \nInc. v. Optibase, Inc. , 103 F.3d 49, 53 ( 7th Cir. 1996) (“For no matter which party got \nthe ball rolling, if Optibase intentionally served the Wisconsin market, Optibase \npurposefully established sufficient minimum contacts to subject it to personal \njurisdiction in Wisconsin.”); Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , 471 U.S. 462, 475 (1985) \n(“So long as a commercial actor’s efforts are ‘purposefully directed’ toward residents \nof another State, we have consistently rejected the notion that an abs ence of physical \ncontacts can defeat personal jurisdiction there.”).   And although Turing argues that \nit had a nationwide marketing strategy for its Turing Shield and did not specifically \ntarget Illinois , [43] at 8, “[t]here is no per se requirement that t he defendant \nespecially target the forum in its business activity ,” Curry , 949 F.3d at 399.  In any \nevent,  the Seventh Circuit has found similar arguments unpersuasive especially \nwhere, as here, the evidence indicates that Turing derived revenue from its s ale of \nthe Turing Shield to dozens of Illinois customers.  See, e.g.  uBID, Inc. v. GoDaddy \nGrp., Inc. , 623 F.3d 421, 428– 29 (7th Cir. 2010) (“[I]t is easy to infer that GoDaddy’s Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 12 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>13 national marketing campaign is intended to reach as large an audience as possible, \nincluding the 13 million potential customers in the nation’s fifth most populous \nstate.”); Illinois v. Hemi Group LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 758 ( 7th Cir. 2010) (finding \nsufficient contacts with Illinois where defendant’s website stated it does business \nwith the residents of forty -nine states and  evidence demonstrated that it  “knowingly \ndid do business with Illinois residents.”).   \nThe cases cited by Turing in support of its argument  all involve facts where \nthe defendant lacked any contacts with the relevant forum state  or that the contacts \nwith the forum  state did not demonstrate that defendant had “purposefully availed” \nor otherwise targeted residents of the forum state.  See Salkau skaite v. Sephora USA, \nInc., No. 18 -cv-08507, 2020 WL 2796122, at *4– 5 (N.D. Ill. May 30, 2020) (finding no \npersonal jurisdiction where evidence showed defendant had not provided its \ntechnology to Illinois customers and where its only Illinois -related cont act was a \nsocial media post discussing the use of its technology at a customer’s Illinois location); Stein v. Clarifai, Inc. , 526 F. Supp.  3d 339, 345 (N.D. Ill. 2021) (finding no personal \njurisdiction where defendant derived only 7 cents in revenue from two Illinois customers who interacted with defendant through a website); Gullen v. \nFacebook.com, Inc. , No. 15 C 7681, 2016 WL 245910, at *2– 3 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 21, 2016) \n(finding no personal jurisdiction where complaint’s only allegation of defendant’s forum -related contact was that defendant operated a website accessible to Illinois \nresidents); Bray v. Lathem Time Co. , No. 19 -3157, 2020 WL 1492742, at *4 (C.D. Ill. \nMar. 20, 2020) (finding no personal jurisdiction where unrebutted evidence Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 13 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>14 demonstrated that defendant’s only Illinois -related contact was the operation of a \nwebsite accessible to its Illinois customers); McGoveran v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc., \n488 F. Supp.  3d 714, 722 (S.D. Ill. 2020) ( “[T]here is no indication that either of these \ncompanies purposefully directed their activities at Illinois residents. ”); Roiser v. \nCascade Mountain, Inc. , 855 N.E.2d 243, 248 (Ill. App. Ct. 2006) ( “The R osiers’ \nlawsuit is not based on any activity within Illinois; therefore, specific jurisdiction \nprinciples are not relevant to their appeal.”).  In contrast to the cases cited by \nDefendant, the evidence here demonstrates that Turing  specifically targeted Il linois \nand its residents in the sale of its products.   \nIn addition to establishing the existence of sufficient minimum contacts, \nPlaintiff must demonstrate that the contacts “arise out of or relate to” the litigation.  \nTuring argues that its contacts with Illinois are “non -suit related business \noperations” and that its Illinois contacts have no causal connection to Plaintiff’s \nclaims.  [43] at 8.  But this is precisely the sort of argument the Supreme Court \nrejected in Ford Motor Co.  v. Montana Eight Judic ial District Ct. , where the Court  \nheld that  it has “never framed the specific jurisdiction inquiry as always requiring \nproof of causation —i.e. , proof that the plaintiff’s claims came about because of the \ndefendant’s in -state conduct.”   141 S. Ct. at 1026.  Rather, the inquiry requires that \na plaintiff’s lawsuit “arise out of or  relate to” the defendant’s contacts with the forum \nstate , which  “contemplates that some relationships will support jurisdiction without \na causal showing.”  Id.     Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 14 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>15 Ford Motor Co.  involved two product liability lawsuits  brought  in Montana and \nMinnesota state  courts against the manufacturer of a vehicle that caused the \nplaintiffs injuries in the forum states.  Id.  at 1022.  The d efendant  argued that its \ncontacts with the forum states —limited to advertising, maintaining car dealerships, \nand providing parts and services for it s products in the forum states —had no causal \nrelationship to plaintiffs’ claims because it designed, manufactured and sold the \nvehicl es that caused their injuries outside of the forum states , and because plaintiffs  \nhad obtained  the specific vehicles involved in their injuries through later resales.  Id. \nat 1023.  The Supreme Court disagreed, noting that although there are “real limits” \nto this inquiry, a “strong relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the \nlitigation” exists because defendant’s contacts  indicated that it “had systematically \nserved a market in [the forum states] for the very vehicles that the plaint iffs allege \nmalfunctioned and injured them in those states.”  Id.  at 1029.   \nHere, Turing’s contacts with Illinois , like the defendant in Ford Motor Co. , \n“relate to” Plaintiff’s claims because Turing’s contacts  with Illinois  involve sales  of \nthe very same Turing Shields that led to  Plaintiff’s alleged  injury.  Like the plaintiffs \nin Ford , Plaintiff  here is a resident  of the forum state , and used the same Turing \nShield that Turing has sold and shipped to other Illinois customers .  And because \nPlaintiff’s injuries arise from her use of the Turing Shield in Illinois without the protections afforded to her under Illinois law, she brought  this law suit “in the most \nnatural state —based on an ‘affiliation between the forum and the under lying Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 15 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>16 controversy, principally, an activity or an occurrence that took place there.”  Id.  \n(quoting Bristol -Myers, 137 S. Ct., at 1179– 80).   \nFinally, the Court must determine whether asserting jurisdiction over a \ndefendant “offend s traditional notions of f air play and substantial justice.”  Int’l Shoe \nCo., 326 U.S. at 316.  To do so, the Court considers  “the burden on the defendant, the \nforum State ’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff ’s interest in obtaining \nconvenient and effective relief, the interstate judicial system ’s interest in obtaining \nthe most efficient resolution of [the underlying dispute], and the shared interest of \nthe several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies .”  Purdue  \nResearch Found ., 338 F.3d at 781 (internal quotation omitted).  As the Seventh \nCircuit has noted, “as long as the plaintiff has made a threshold showing of minimum \ncontacts, that showing is generally defeated only where the defendant presents ‘a compelling case that the  presence of some other considerations would render \njurisdiction unreasonable.’”  Curry , 949 F.3d at 402 ( quoting  Burger King , 471 U.S. \nat 477).  Here, T uring simply argues that  “it would be unfair to subject a California \nentity with no contacts to Illinoi s to this Court’s jurisdiction.”  [43] at 1 5–16.  But, as \ndiscussed above, Turing has sufficient contacts with Illinois that relate  to the claims \nbrought by Plaintiff , and it points to no other reason that would render jurisdiction \notherwise unreasonable or unfair .  See Curry , 949 F.3d at 402 (“There is no unfairness \nin requiring a defendant to defend a lawsuit in the courts of the state where, through the very activity giving rise to the suit, it continues to gain so much.”) ; Hemi , 622 \nF.3d at 760 (finding that jurisdiction in Illinois was fair where defendant had Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 16 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>17 established an “expansive, sophisticated commercial venture online,” held itself out \nto conduct business nationwide, and succeeded in reaching customers across the \ncountr y.”).  In any event , the Court finds  Illinois has a strong interest in providing a \nforum for individuals who wish to seek redress for BIPA violations even if a non -\nforum resident inflicted the alleged harms and Plaintiff here seeks to represent a \nclass of all individuals in Illinois who had their biometric data collected by Turing.  \nSee [1-1] ¶ 68.  Accordingly, the Court denies Turing’s Rule 12(b)(2) m otion to dismiss.   \nB. Subject -Matter Jurisdiction:  Preemption Under the LMRA  \nTuring next argues that this Court lacks  subject -matter jurisdiction over \nPlaintiff’s claims because they are preempted by Section 301 of the Labor \nManagement Relations Act (“LMRA”), 29 U.S.C. § 185 .     \nSection 301 of the LMRA establishes federal jurisdiction over “suits for \nviolations of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing \nemployees in an industry affecting commerce” without respect to the amount in controversy or citizens hip of the parties.  29 U.S.C. § 185(a).  T he Supreme Court has \ninterpreted this provision as one that  “express es a federal policy that federal courts \nshould enforce these agreements on behalf of or against labor organizations.”  Textile \nWorkers Union of America v. Lincoln Mills of Ala. , 353 U.S. 448, 455 (1957).  This \nfederal policy would be thwarted, however, if the resolution of Section 301 claims \ninvolved conflicting applications of state and federal law.  See Local 174, Teamsters, \nChauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of Am . v. Lucas Flour , 369 U.S. 95, 103 \n(1962) (“The possibility that individual contract terms might have different meanings Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 17 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>28 they are intended to be used for a medical purpose  but in an effort to expand these \nsystems’ availability during the COVID -19 public health emergency, the FDA intends \nto “not object” to their use for medical purposes provided the y comply with the \nEnforcement Policy’s recommendations, such as  adding labels on the systems that \nhelp users understand the device and caution the device is not FDA -cleared or \napproved.  Enforcement Policy at 4.  Yet, e ven if the Turing Shield might meet the \nFDA’s recommendations outlined in the Enforcement Policy (which the Court canno t \ndetermine based solely on the pleadings), the Enforcement Policy does not give \ntelethermographic systems “de facto ” clearance  in accordance with the FDCA’s \ncomplex statutory and regulatory scheme.  See, e.g. , 21 U.S.C. § 360c et seq .; Riegel v. \nMedtronic, Inc. , 552 U.S. 312 (2008) (discussing the premarket approval process for \ndevices under the FDCA, which the court describes as a “rigorous process,” and the \napproval process for devices under Section 510(k) of the FDCA).  To the contrary , the \nEnforcement Policy states the general rule that telethermographic systems intended \nfor medical purposes must receive approval from the FDA under the FDCA.  See \nEnforcement Policy at 7  (“In general, manufacturers of telethermographic systems \nintended for adjunctive dia gnostic screening are required to submit premarket \nnotification pursuant to section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and 21 \nCFR 807.81 to FDA and receive FDA clearance prior to marketing these devices in the United States, as well as comply with p ostmarketing requirements.”).  \nFurther more , the Policy states that the FDA will “not object” to the use of \ntelethermographic systems for medical purposes for the duration of the COVID -19 Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 28 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>29 public health emergency  if, among other things, manufacturers include labels \ncaution ing that the devices are not FDA -cleared or approved.6  \n In short, t he PREP Act’s definition of “covered countermeasures” is clear and \nunambiguous.  It provides immunity only for “claims for los s” that “arise or relate to” \nthe use of a covered countermeasure.  Because there is nothing in the record to \nindicate that the Turing Shield meets the requirements of the PREP Act’s definition \nof a “covered countermeasure,” the PREP Act’s immunity provisions do not apply  to \nPlaintiff’s BIPA claims.  Accordingly, the Court denies Turing’s motion to dismiss  on \nthis basis.7   \nc. Sufficiency of Plaintiff’s BIPA  Claims  \nFinally, Turing argu es that the Complaint  fails to allege that Turing collected, \ncaptured or possessed any “biometric identifiers” or “biometric information” as \ndefined under BIPA.  [28] at 21.  Turing insists that the data it collected from \nPlaintiff’s face does not qualify as a “scan of facial geometr y” under BIPA  because a \n \n6 Moreover, even if the Enforcement Policy constituted a “ de facto ” FDA clearance, the non -binding \nnature of the Enforcement Policy means it is not entitled to deference under Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. \nNational Resources Defense Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  The Enforcement Policy plainly states \nthat “[t]his guidance  represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration [] on this \ntopic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.”  \nEnforcement Policy at 1; s ee also  21 C.F.R. § 10.115(d)(1) (“Guidance documen ts do not establish \nlegally enforceable rights or responsibilities.”).  As the Seventh Circuit has noted, the court remains \n“extraordinarily reluctant to follow unofficial interpretations which the agency itself does not view as \nbinding.”  Echevarria v. Ch i. Title & Trust Co. , 256 F.3d 623, 629 (7th Cir. 2001); see also  Christensen \nv. Harris Cnty. , 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (“Interpretations such as those in opinion letters —like \ninterpretations contained in policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines, all of which lack the force of law —do not warrant Chevron -style deference.”).   \n \n7 Plaintiff also argues that her injuries have no causal connection to her use of the Turing Shield as \nan alleged “countermeasure”  because her claims involve Turin g’s failure to provide her with required \ndisclosures and obtain her written consent prior to collecting her biometric information, [37] at 24.  The Court need not address this argument given its finding  that the Turing Shield does not qualify as  \na covered countermeasure under the PREP Act.   \n Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 29 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>30 scan of a face geometry only encompasses “a ‘scan’ by ‘facial recognition software’ that \n‘extracts a highly detailed map or template for each face based on its unique points \nand contours.’”  [28] at 15 (quoting Monroy , 2017 WL 40998 46, at *1) .  Here, Turing \nrelies  upon a definition of “scan of face geometry” that does  not come  from BIPA itself \nbut rather from another court’s recitation of what the plaintiff in another BIPA case \nalleged the defendant’s technology did.  See Monroy , 2017 WL 4099846, at *1 \n(“Shutterfly’s facial recognition software scans the image, locates each of the faces in \nthe image, and extracts a highly detailed ‘map’ or ‘template’ for each face based on its \nunique points and contours.”).  BIPA ’s operative legal tex t, however, defines  \n“biometric identifier” as a “retina or iris scan, fingerprint, voiceprint, or scan of hand \nor face geometry” and defines “biometric information” as “any information, regardless \nof how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.”  740 ILCS 14/10.   Thus, t he real issue here \nis whether Plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to allow for a plausible inference that \nthe Turing Shield collected Plaintiff’s “biometric identifier” or stored her “biometric \ninformation” as those terms are defined under the plain language of BIPA.  \n The Court concludes that she has  done so.  In her complaint, Plain tiff alleges \nthat the Turing Shield utilizes an “artificial intelligence algorithm” to detect a user’s \nforehead in order to take the user’s temperature and also uses “facial recognition \nsoftware” to detect whether the user is wearing a face mask.  [1 -1] ¶ 5.  In addition to \ntemperature screenings and face mask detection, the Turing Shield also allegedly  \n“recognize s the user” by using its camera to “collect[] the user’s facial geometry” and Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 30 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>31 analyzes  the data through the use of an  algorithm , id., and then stores the data \ncollected from the screening in Turing’s database(s), which can identify up to 20 \nmillion faces.  Id.  ¶ 6.  These allegations allow for a  plausible inference that the \nTuring Shield’s temperature screening, face mask detection, and facial recog nition \nfunctions require  a scan of Plaintiff’s face , which amounts to a “scan of . . . face \ngeometry” within BIPA’s definition s of biometric identifier and biometric \ninformation.  Plaintiff also alleges that Turing collected and disseminated this data \nto third parties without providing her with the disclosures required by BIPA or \nreceiving her written consent.  Id. ¶¶ 57– 58, 63.  Thus, Plaintiff  also alleg es a \nplausible claim against Turing for violations of Section 15(b) and (d) of BIPA.  See 740 \nILCS 14/15(b), (d).  \nFinally, Turing’s last argument —that Plaintiff failed to allege how the Turing \nShield identifies employees based on the temperature screening or face mask \ndetection function —cannot be resolved on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  [28] at \n22; [41] at 18.  At the pleading stage, a plaintiff need not allege “detailed factual \nallegations,” but must allege “enough factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim \nto relief that is plausible on its face.”  Iqbal , 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly , 550 \nU.S. at 570)).  As discussed above, Plaintiff has alleged that the Turing Shield’s “artificial intelligence algorithms” analyze a user’s face scan to not only screen a user’s temperature and detect for face masks, but also recognize a user against a \ndatabase that can store up to 20 million faces.  [1- 1] at ¶¶ 5, 6.  Further discovery Case: 1:21-cv-04409 Document #: 46 Filed: 09/26/22 Page 31 of 32 PageID #:<pageID>32 \nmay shed light on exactly how the Turing Shield does this but, at the pleading stage, \nPlaintiff’s allegations suffice  to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.   \nIV.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case centers on a dispute between Aaron M. Ogletree and Cleveland State University over the university's practice of conducting room scans before remote examinations. Ogletree contended that these scans, which involved using a student's camera to check for impermissible aids during a remote test, violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. The court, analyzing the privacy expectations in a student's home and the absence of a sufficiently pressing need for such invasive measures, found in favor of Ogletree, ruling that room scans constitute an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the room scans conducted by Cleveland State University during remote examinations constitute an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that the room scans conducted by Cleveland State University are indeed searches under the Fourth Amendment and are unreasonable. Therefore, they violate the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you're taking a test at home, and your school wants to make sure you're not cheating by asking to look around your room using your webcam. The court decided that this is too much of an invasion of your privacy, like having a stranger peek into your private space without a good reason, and ruled that it wasn't okay under the law.",

OGLETREE , \n \nPlaintiff,  \n \nv. \n CLEVELAND STATE \nUNIVERSITY , \n \nDefendant.  \n ) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n) \n Case No. 1:21-cv-00500  \n Judge J. Philip Calabrese  \n \n \nOPINION AND O RDER \n Even before the Covid -19 pandemic, Cleveland State University offered \ncourses online and used various methods to ensure the integrity of remote tests.  One \nmethod involves using a student’s camera briefly to scan the test taker’s surroundings \nfor potential  impermissible study aids or notes.  Plaintiff Aaron Ogletree , a student \nat Cleveland State University, filed suit alleging that this practice or policy violated \nhis rights when a proctor asked him to conduct a room scan of his bedroom before \nstarting a re mote test.   \nPlaintiff and Defendant each move for summary judgment.  For the following \nreasons, the Court DENIES  Defendant’s motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 29)  \nand GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion  (ECF No. 30) . Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  1 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>2 STATEMENT OF FACTS  \n This case arises out of a scan Cleveland State University conducted of a \nstudent’s bedroom in connection with a remote test Mr. Ogletree took for one of his \nclasses .  The record contains the following facts, which are largely undisputed.   \nA. Cleveland State’s Remote  Testing Policies  \nCleveland State University offers some classes remotely.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 11, \nPageID #146; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 11, PageID #160.)  In May 2016, Cleveland State \npublished campus -wide guidelines for online classes in a document titled “ Required  \nProcedures & Recommended  Practices to Address Security and Quality of eLearning \nCourses.”   (ECF No. 25 -2, PageID #330.)   One of the purposes of the document was \nto ensure the integrity of remote tests.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #268.)  \nA required procedure mandates that students taking online classes have a \nphotograph in Cleveland State’s database  at the time of registration  so as “to \neliminate impersonation and to ensure that the same student enrolled in the course \nis attending the online lectures and taking  the exams.”  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID \n#273– 74; ECF No.  25-2, PageID #330.)  However, Cleveland State does not enforce \nthis procedure , and some students taking online classes do not have a photograph in \nthe database.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #272– 74.) \nIn addition to requir ed procedures, the University’s recommended practices \nleave testing “to the faculty member’s discretion to implement.”  (ECF No. 25 -2, \nPageID #331.)   Some recommended practices include randomiz ing the order of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  2 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>3 questions, us ing timed tests, and using  remote proctoring tools.  (Id., PageID \n#331– 32.)   \nAs remote proctoring tools, Cleveland State offers several programs  desig ned \nto enhance  “online test security and proctoring.”  ( Id., PageID #332.)  For instance, \nCleveland State’s  learning management system , Blackboard , offers a plagiarism \ndetection system  and generates  reports “that faculty can use to see more information \nabout student activity, including  the IP address from where they logged in, how much \ntime they spent in the exam .”  (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #262– 63 & 312.)  Cleveland \nState also uses the proctoring tools Rospondus  and Honorlock.  ( Id., PageID # 291.)   \nFor Respondus, Respondus LockDown Browser prevents students from accessing the \ninternet or using other computer programs during a remote test, while Rospondus \nMonitor records the student taking the exam and uses artificial  intelligence to flag \nsuspicious activ ity.  (Id., PageID # 305– 06 & 321.)  Similarly, Honorlock uses a \nstudent’s camera  and artificial intelligence monitoring.   (Id., PageID #299.)   Among \nthese remote proctoring tools, faculty members have discretion to choose which tool \nor combination of tools , if any, are necessary to preserve the integrity of the remote \nexam.  ( Id., PageID #275– 76 & 295.) \nB. Cleveland State ’s Use of Room Scans  \nCleveland State neither requires nor  recommends the use of a room scan  \npursuant to any written policy .  (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #277.)   In a non- proctored \nexam, there is no room scan.  ( Id., PageID #283.)   However, each of the online \nproctoring tools that Cleveland State  uses, Respondus and Honorlock, requires a Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  3 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>4 room scan as part of its prerecorded instructions.  ( Id., PageID #291– 93.)  In  in-person \nproctored exams , the test coordinator at Cleveland State University  Testing Services \ninformed Mr. Ogletree by email that it has a process of performing a “cursory review \nof [the student’s] immediate testing space,” and “[a]ll  students, regardless of the \ncourse or instructor, are asked to do this as part of the check -in process.”   (ECF No. \n26-7, PageID #413.)    \nWhen a student takes an o nline exam , it proceeds as follows.  First, at the \noutset of a  proctored online exam, whether  proctored through an electronic \napplication or an actual person, students must “show their ID next to their face so \nyou can clearly see and read the ID and be able to tell that that person is the same person that is on the ID.”  (ECF No.  25-1, PageID #282 ; ECF No. 24 -1\n, PageID #202.)   \nSecond , either the proctoring application or the proctor prompts  the student to \nconduct a room scan of his  environment.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #282; ECF No. 24 -1, \nPageID #211 .)  Other students taking the remote test can see the room scans of other \nstudents.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #212.)  \nThe proctor who performed the room scan at issue in this case testified that \nher supervisor , the Cleveland State Testing Services ’ test coordinato r, instructed her \nto perform the room scan.  ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #214.)  Further, the proctor \npresumed that a room scan was required unless the professor in the class instructed \notherwise.  ( Id., PageID #215.)  As to whether students may refuse to conduc t the \nroom scan, the proctor testified that she never had a student refuse , and she was not \naware of a Cleveland State policy addressing how to handle a student’s refusal.  ( Id., Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  4 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>5 PageID #213.)   The proctor testified that in the event of a refusal, she would allow \nthe student to take the test but notify the professor that the student refused to \nperform the room scan.  ( Id.) \nC. Mr. Ogletree’s Enrollment at Cleveland State  \n At the time of the events relevant to this action, Mr. Ogletree studied \nchemistry at Cleve land State University.  ( ECF No. 26- 1, PageID #352.)  For the \nspring 2021 semester , Mr. Ogletree enr olled in five classes.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 39,  \nPageID #1 49–50.)  Due to the Covi d-19 pandemic, most Cleveland State classes \nduring the spring 2021 semester were  conducted remotely.  ( ECF No. 1 , ¶ 40, PageID \n#150; ECF No.  19, ¶ 40, PageID #163.)    \nIn the complaint, Plaintiff alleges that during the spring 2021 semester, \nCleveland State required students to complete and pass a “Daily Health Assessment” \nto attend a class in -person  on campus .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 42,  PageID #150.)   Attending \nclasses in person was not an option for him, Plaintiff says, because of “various health issues that impact his immune system and put him at particular risk to the COVID pandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 45, PageID #150.)   Further, “[b]ecause of his health issues, \nOgletree does not pass the Daily Health Assessment” ; therefore , Cleveland State  \nwould not permit him to take his tests in -person on campus .  (Id., ¶¶ 46 & 47 , PageID \n#150.)   Plaintiff also alleged he has “family members who are at high -risk to the \npandemic.”  ( Id., ¶ 48, PageID #150.)  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  5 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>6 D. The Room Scan  \nIn January 2021, Mr. Ogletree disputed a policy contained in the syllabus for \nhis General Chemistry II class.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 49, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 49, \nPageID #164.)   The policy stated:   “The proctors and I reserve the right to ask any \nstudent, before, during, or after an exam to show their surroundings, screen, and/or \nwork area.  We will send you a private chat to ask you  to do this.  If you do not see \nthe chat message, I will use the microphone to ask you to check the chat.”  ( Id.)  Three \ndays later, the Professor removed the  policy  from the syllabus .  (ECF No. 17 , ¶ 50, \nPageID  #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 50, PageID #164.)   \n On February 17, 2021, Mr. Ogletree had a General Chemistry II remote test \nscheduled for 12:30 pm.  ( ECF No. 17 , ¶ 51, PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , ¶ 51, PageID \n#164.)  At the time, Mr. Ogletree lived with his mother an d two siblings, who were all \nhome when Mr. Ogletree took the chemistry exam.  ( ECF No. 26 -1, PageID #354– 55.)  \nCleveland State requires students to take remote tests in a location where they will \nbe alone and uninterrupted.  ( ECF No. 17 , PageID #151; ECF No. 19 , PageID #165.)  \nMr. Ogletree testified that his bedroom was the only suitable testing environment.  (\nECF No. 26 -1, PageID #366.)   \nThat morning, at 10:25 am, almost two hours before scheduled exam, \nCleveland State Testing Services emailed Mr. Ogletree to inform him the proctor \nwould be “checking your ID, your surroundings and your materials.”  ( ECF No. 26 -5, \nPageID #4 09.)  At 10:40 am, Mr. Ogletree replied to the email.  ( Id.)  Mr. Ogletree \nexplained that he “currently [had] confidential settlement do cuments in the form of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  6 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>7 late arriving 1099s scattered about [his] work area and there is not enough time to \nsecure them.”  ( Id.)  \n At the start of the exam, the proctor asked Mr. Ogletree to perform a room scan \nof his bedroom , and Mr. Ogletree complied .  (ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #226.)  The scan \nlasted less than a minute , and as little as ten to twenty seconds .  (Id., PageID #227 ; \nECF No. 26 -1, PageID #368.)  The proctor testified that she did not see any tax \ndocuments or medications.   (ECF No.  24-1, PageID #239 –40.) \n The room scan and the test were recorded,  and the video recording was \nretained by Cleveland State’s third -party  vendor.  ( ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301.)  \nCleveland State is not aware of any dat a breaches related to remote exam  recordings , \nand access to the video is strictly controlled.   (ECF No. 25 -1, PageID #301 ; ECF No. \n24-1, PageID #236– 37.) \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n Based on these facts, Plaintiff  alleges  that Defendant violated his rights under  \nthe Fourth Amendment and seeks injunctive and declaratory relief.  ( ECF No. 17 , \nPageID #152 –53.)  Both Plaintiff and Defendant move  for summary judgment.   (ECF \nNos. 29 & 30.)  \nANALYSIS \nPursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary \njudgment is appropriate “if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to \nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”  Fed.  R. \nCiv. P. 56(a).  On a motion for summary judgment, the Court must view evidence in Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  7 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>8 the light most favorable to the non -moving party.  Kirilenko -Ison v. Board of Educ. of \nDanville Indep. Schs., 974 F.3d 652, 660 (6th Cir. 2020) (citing Matsushita Elec. \nIndus. Co., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp ., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)).  Ultimately, the \nCourt mu st determine whether “one party must prevail as a matter of law.”  Anderson \nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc ., 477 U.S. 242, 251 (1986) .   \nI. Fourth Amendment  Searches  \nThe Fourth Amendment protects “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.”  \nU.S. Const. amend. IV; United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400, 404 (2012).  Plaintiff \ncontends t hat Cleveland State’s policy of conducting warrantless room scans of \nstudents’ homes violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable \nsearches as it applies to the State of Ohio through the Fourteenth Amendment.  ( ECF \nNo. 17 , PageID #153.)   \n At the outset, the parties contest whether the remote virtual room scans at \nissue qualify as searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  Specifically, \nthey debate whether the Fourth Amendment applies under Wyman v. James, 400 \nU.S. 309 (1971), and its progeny.   \nI.A. General  Principles \n A Fourth Amendment search “occurs when the government violates a \nsubjective expectation of privacy that society recognizes as reasonable.”  Kyllo v. \nUnited States , 533 U.S. 27, 33 (2001) (citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 361 \n(1967) ).  Even in the expressly  protected location of a house, which receives Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  8 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>9 heightened protection under the Fourth Amendment, a  search within the meaning of \nthe Constitution does not occur unless “the individual manifested a subje ctive \nexpectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search,” and society is “willing \nto recognize that expectation as reasonable.”  Id.  (citing California v. Ciraolo , 47 U.S. \n207, 211 (1986)).  \nPlaintiff contends  that the  remote  room  scans at issue are Fourth Amendment \nsearches because students have a subjective expectation of privacy in their houses , \nand especially in their bedrooms, and society recognizes that expectation as \nreasonable.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #499.)  In response, Defendant maintains  that \nPlaintiff’s subjective expectation of privacy was not objectively reasonable.   (ECF \nNo. 34, PageID #512.)   Defendant points to evidence showing that room  scans are \n“standard industry wide practice” and that students frequently acquiesce in  their use.  \n(ECF No. 34 , PageID #512– 14.)   \nAlthough the record shows that no student, other than Mr. Ogletree, ever \nobjected to the scans ( ECF No. 24 -1, PageID #213), the facts  also implicate the core \nplaces where society, to the extent it can agree on much  these days , recognizes \nreasonable and legitimate privacy interests —namely, the home.  Though schools may \nroutinely employ remote technology to peer into houses without objection from some, \nmost, or nearly  all students, it does not follow that others might  not object to the \nvirtual intrusion into their homes or that the routine use of a practice such as room scans does not violate a privacy interest that society recognizes  as reasonable, both \nfactually and legally.  Therefore, the Court determines that Mr. Ogletree’s subjective Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  9 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>10 expectation of privacy at issue is one that society views as reasonable and that lies at \nthe core of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against governmental intrusion.  \nTo support the argument that the expectation of privacy Plaintiff claims is \nobjectively unreasonable, Defendant relies on several  cases.  First , Defendant argues \nthat the room  scans are  not searches because they are  routine .  For this proposition, \nDefendant cites California v. Ciraolo , 476 U.S. 207, 215 (1986) , in which the Supreme \nCourt held that it was unreasonable to expect that marijuana plants were \nconstitutionally protected from being observed from an altitude of 1,000 feet “in an age where private and commercial  flight in the public airways is routine.”   See also \nFlorida v. Riley , 488 U.S. 445, 449– 50 (1989) (same).  In Ciraolo and Riley , due to  \nmodern  flight  technology and its routine use, the marijuana plants were  openly  \nobservable.   These cases build on the traditional notion that governmental officials,  \nlawfully in a public place, do not conduct unlawful searches simply by  observ ing \nthings  in plain view.  But the room scans peer behind walls and make visible places \noutside the ambit of cases such as Ciraolo and Riley .  Rooms scans go where people \notherwise would not, at least not without a warrant or an invitation.  \nNor does it follow that room  scans are not searches because the technolog y is \n“in general public use.”  Defendant cites Kyllo , 533 U.S. at 34– 40, in which the \nSupreme Court held that law enforcement’s use of thermal imaging technology  not \n“in general public use” to explore the interior of the home constituted a Fourth \nAmendment search .  But t he Supreme Court did not  hold the inverse —that the use \nof a technology “in gene ral public use”  could not be a Fourth Amendment search.   To Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  10 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>11 the contrary, Katz  held, as relevant here, that the procedural antecedents to a search \nthat the Constitution requires apply even where new technologies make accessible \nplaces and information not o therwise obtainable without a physical intrusion.   389 \nU.S. at 359.   While cameras  might  be generally available and now commonly used , \nmembers of the  public cannot use  them  to see into a n office, house, or other place not \npublicly visible without the owner’s consent.   \nFinally, Defendant cites  City of Ontario, California v. Quon , 560 U.S. 746  \n(2010), in which the Supreme Court considered the privacy  expectations of \ngovernmental employees in communications made on electronic equipment  that the \nemployer  owns .  T here, t he Court observed that rapid changes related to \ncommunications were evident in both the technology and “what society accepts as \nproper behavior” and noted that the “operational realities of the workplace” might \nbear on the reason ableness of employees’ expectation of privacy.   Id. at 756– 59.  But \nQuon arose within the  particular context of the employment relationship .  Although \nthe truism that technological change affects the degree of privacy that society accepts \nas reasonable has  broader application, Quon  and the cases that followed it have not \nextended this principle beyond the employment context.  Any decision to do so \nproperly lies with another court , particularly if doing so pares back constitutional \nprotections across differe nt areas of the law .   \nFollowing Katz , Fourth Amendment jurisprudence examines an individual’s \nexpectation of privacy in a particular place .  The ubiquity  of a particular  technolog y \nor its application s does not directly bear on that analysis .  Here, the room  scan Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  11 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>12 occurred in Plaintiff’s house, in his bedroom, in fact .  At the Fourth Amendment’s \n“very core” lies “ the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from \nunreasonable governmental intrusion.”  Florida v. Jardines, 569 U.S. 1, 6 (2013) \n(citing Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511 (1961) ).  Consistent with \nestablished precedent, the Court determines that Plaintiff  had an objectively \nreasonable expectation of privacy in his home—and one that society recognizes as \nreasonable .  \nI.B. Searches Under Wyman  v. James  \nAdditionally , Defendant  contends that the room  scans are not “searches” \nbecause they are limited in scope, conducted for a regulatory or administrative \npurpose, and not coerced.   (ECF No. 29 , PageID #46 2–66.)  In support of the \nproposition that these attributes remove the room  scans from the ambit of the Fourth \nAmendment, Defendant relies on Wyman v. James , 400 U.S. 309 (1971) , and its \nprogeny.  \n In Wyman , the Supreme C ourt considered whether a welfare beneficiary may \nrefuse a home visit by her  caseworker without risking the termination of benefits.  \n400 U.S. at 310.   The Wyman Court specifically considered the heightened  protection \nthe Fourth Amendment affords to the privacy of the home  and noted that “one’s  \nFourth Amendment protection subsists apart from his being suspected of criminal \nbehavior .”  Id. at 316 (citing Camara v. Municipal Ct ., 387 U.S. 523, 528– 30 (1967)) .  \nNonetheless, t he Court held  that this “protective  attitude” in the law was not a factor \nin the case because the home visit was not a search in the Fourth Amendment sense .  Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  12 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>13 Id. at 318.  Though  State law made the visit mandatory for continu ing benefits  and \nthe visit served both rehabilitative and investiga tive purposes , the Court concluded  \nthat the visit could not be equated with a search in the traditional criminal law \ncontext.  Id.   Indeed , the visit was not forced or compelled, the beneficiary’s denial of \npermission was not a criminal ac t, and if the beneficiary did  not consent then the \nvisitation did not occur and the aid “merely cease [d].”  Id. \n The other cases Defendant cites stem from Wyman .  In S.L. v. Whitburn, 67 \nF.3d 1299, 1307 (7th Cir. 1995) , and Sanchez v. C ity of San Diego , 464 F.3d 916, \n920– 23 (9th Cir. 2006) , the Seventh and Ninth Circuit s noted  that they were bound \nby Wyman  and held  that home visits made pursuant to the administration of welfare \nbenefits  were not searches under the Fourth Amendment.   See also  Schmid v. City of \nSonoma , No. 19 -cv-00883, 2021 WL 1118077, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 24, 2021)  \n(upholding denial of an exemption for refusal to consent to a permit -related inspection \non the grounds that the inspections were not Fourth Amendment searches unde r \nWyman ).  Similarly, in Marcavage v. Borough of Lansdowne, P ennsylvania , 493 F. \nApp’x 301 (3d Cir. 2012) , the court upheld an ordinance  authorizing denial of a rental \nlicense if the property owner refused to consent to an inspection .  The Third Circuit \nreasoned that the ordinance “requires a limited search by the city official for the \nspecific purpose of receiving a benefit under the law,”  which is constitutional under \nWyman .  Id.  at 306.  \n Based on Wyman ’s differentiation between investigations and Fourth \nAmendment searches, Defendant advances several reasons why its room  scans of Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  13 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>14 students’ homes are not searches.  First, Defendant conducted the scan for the \nregulatory purpose of protecting exam integrity , not for any purpose related to \ncriminality.  ( ECF No. 29 , PageID #463.)  Second, the scan was not coerced because \nPlaintiff was free to object to the scan or refuse to perform it.  ( Id.)  A student who \nrefused to conduct the exam could still take the tes t, and e ven if failure to conduct \nthe scan resulted in not getting credit for the exam, that consequence is  less severe \nthan the loss of  welfare benefits in Wyman .  (Id., PageID #464– 65.)  Third, the scan \nwas limited in scope because it was brief , only rev ealed items in plain view , and the \nstudent controlled the inspection to the extent that the student chose where in the \nhouse to take the exam and where in the room to direct the camera  during the scan.  \n(Id., PageID #463– 64.)  Defendant argues that the room  scan was less intrusive than \nthe home visits in Wyman  because no State officer physically entered Plaintiff’s home, \nDefendant told Plaintiff of the scan two hours in advance, and Plaintiff could choose the part of the home  to be inspected and remove any  private matters from plain view.  \n(Id., PageID #464. )   \n Plaintiff responds that Defendant overreads Wyman .  (ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#500.)   Plaintiff points to the Sixth Circuit’s holding in Andrews v. Hickman County, \nTennessee , 700 F.3d 845 (6th Cir. 2012).  There, the court considered whether social \nworkers who conducted a warrantless home visit in a child abuse investigation were \nentitled to qualified immunity.  The Sixth Circuit noted that the Fourth Amendment’s restrictions on  unreasonable searches extended to the “activities of civil as well as \ncriminal authorities.”  Id. at 858– 59 (citing New Jersey v. T.L.O ., 469 U.S. 325, 335 Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  14 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>15 (1985) ).  Describing case law from other circuits , the c ourt referenced a case in which \nthe Ninth Circuit declined to exempt social workers investigating allegations of child \nabuse from the Fourth Amendment by distinguishing Wyman as mak ing “receipt of \na requested welfare benefit contingent on the grant of entr y for a search intended to \nconfirm that the monies were being used in the recipient child ’s interest, where the \nentry under the state program was of a limited and consensual nature, and the \nrequirement applied to all recipients .”  Id.  at 859 (citing Calabretta v. Floyd , 189 F.3d \n808, 816 (9th Cir. 1999) ).  “Given the presumption that state actors are governed by \nthe Fourth Amendment and the sanctity of the home under the Fourth Amendment,” \nthe Sixth Circuit held  that social workers were governed by the Four th Amendment’s \nwarrant requirement.   700 F.3d at 859.  \n Plaintiff argues that Andrews shows that Wyman did not create a Fourth \nAmendment exception for civil authorities.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID #501.)   Rather, \nlongstanding  precedent establishes that the Fourt h Amendment applies to searches \nconducted for noncriminal purposes , especially in the home.  ( ECF No. 33 , PageID \n#501– 02.)  Further, Plaintiff maintains that it is well  establishe d that the Fourth \nAmendment applies to all intrusions into a private home, however limited.  ( Id., \nPageID #50 2–03.)  Defendant does not dispute that the Fourth Amendment  gives \nheightened protection to  the home or that the Fourth Amendment applies in \nnoncriminal matters.  ( ECF No. 35 , PageID #533.)   However, Defendant argues  that \nthe Wyman Court considered both of those points and , nonetheless , determined that \nno Fourth Amendment search occurred.  ( Id.) Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  15 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>16  Wyman  dates to 1971,  more than fifty years ago .  Since then, society, \ntechnology, and Fourth Ame ndment jurisprudence have changed markedly.  In the \ncases applying Wyman on which Defendant relies , courts applied Wyman in the \ncontext of upholding termination or denial of a benefit following the beneficiary’s \nrefusal to consent to an inspection, where r efusal triggered no penalties except the \ntermination or denial of benefits.  In this respect, the Sixth Circuit’s decision in \nAndrews, quoting Calabretta from the Ninth Circuit, accurately reads this line of \ncases as applying to a fairly distinct set of ci rcumstances materially different than \nthose at issue here :  making welfare benefits contingent, for all recipients, on a \nlimited and consensual search to confirm expenditure of the funds for the interest of a child.  In contrast , unlike Wyman  and its proge ny, this case involves the privilege \nof college admission and attendance and does not involve a benefit made available to \nall citizens as of right.  Additionally, the record here shows a variable policy —\nenforced , unevenl y, in the discretion of a combination of proctors and professors —of \nusing remote scans that make a student’s home visible , including to other students , \nwith uncertain consequences .   \n Finally, the Court addresses Plaintiff ’s argument that New Jersey v. T.L.O. , \n469 U.S. 325 (1985), provides the proper standard for  the constitutionality of searches \nthat school officials  conduct .  (ECF No. 33\n, PageID #503.)  In  T.L.O. , the Supreme \nCourt  held that the Fourth Amendment applies to searches by school officials , with \nsome accommodation to respond to the needs of the educational environment and \nassess the legality of those searches .  Id.  at 341– 42.  But T.L.O. does not speak to the Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  16 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>17 threshold question of when a school official’s actions constitute a search within the \nmeaning of the Fourth Amendment.   Accordingly, the Court need  not address T.L.O.  \non this question.    \n* * * \n For these reasons, the Court concludes that the Fourth Amendment applies to \nthe virtual room scans Cleveland State uses.  Holding otherwise, as Defenda nt \nargues, raises even more difficult questions about what legal standard, if any, governs \nthe scans and the potential consequences of such a ruling in other areas of life  and \nthe law  that technology touches.  \nII.  Fourth Amendment Reasonableness \n The Fourt h Amendment proscribes only those searches that are unreasonable.  \nHaving held  that the room  scans are searches for purposes of  the Fourth Amendment, \nthe Court turns to whether the scans a re reasonable.   Whether a particular search \nmeets the reasonableness standard “is judged by balancing its intrusion on the \nindividual's Fourth Amendment interests against its promotion of legitimate \ngovernmental interests.”  Skinner v. Railway Labor Execs. ’ Ass’n , 489 U.S . 602, 619 \n(1989) (quoting Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648,  654 (1979) ).  Alt hough the Fourth \nAmendment mandates that no warrant may issue except on a showing of probable \ncause, that requirement is not absolute.   A warrant is not required in every case.   \nNational Treasury Emps. Union v. Von Raab , 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989) .  As the text \nof the Fourth Amendment makes clear, the Constitution protects against \nunreasonable  searches and seizures, making reasonableness the ultimate touchstone Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  17 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>20 829–30 (citing Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J , 515 U.S. at 656).  In this context, \nreasonableness under t he Fourth Amendment is informed by the status of students \nas “unemancipated minors” who “have been committed to the temporary custody of \nthe State as schoolm aster.”  Id.  at 654.  In short, under this line of cases, minor \nstudents subject to compulsory school attendance have a lesser privacy interest.  \nIn contrast, Mr. Ogletree was an adult at the time of the search at issue and \nenrolled at Cleveland State by ch oice.  Although this setting might affect the nature \nof the privacy interest at stake to some degree, it is difficult to see how enrollment in \na higher educational institution would limit the core protections of the home under \nthe Fourth Amendment on the f acts and circumstances of this case.   \nII.B.  Character of the Intrusion  \n On the record presented, this analysis encompasses several considerations.  \nFirst, by enrolling in classes at Cleveland State, Mr. Ogletree necessarily traded away \nsome privacy for the privilege and for other goods , such as the opportunity to earn \neducational credentials or to interact with other students or faculty .  Of course, he \nretained his constitutional rights.  See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist ., \n393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969).  In normal times, a student might be able to choose another \ncollege or among classes with different options for tests and assessments.  A student \nwho valued privacy more might opt for courses with in -person tests, while another \nwho prefers conven ience might tolerate an intrusion of the sort at issue here.  \nCleveland State’s policies and practices make such choices and tradeoffs opaque, at \nbest.  Faculty members have discretion on how to implement remote testing.   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  20 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>21 Moreover, b ecause of the pandemic , such choices were not available.  The \nrecord establishes that Mr. Ogletree  did not have the option of attending in -person \nclasses at the time of the room scan.  In other words, enrollment in online courses \nwas Plaintiff’s only option to continue to pursu e his education at Cleveland State.   \nMoreover, in Mr. Ogletree’s case, the professor changed the policy shortly after the start of the course.   As a result, Plaintiff reasonably believed he would not be subject \nto a room scan until approximately two hours before the time of his test.  \nBut the room scan at issue was minimally intrusive.  It is undisputed that the \nscan occurred over an exceedingly short period of time, and Plaintiff had discretion \nover where to direct the camera  in his room , as well as some warning to take steps to \nprotect his priva cy and ensure that the confidential materials he had were not readily \nin view .  On the other hand, other students can see the room scans.  Further, the \n“Fourth Amendment’s protection of the home has never been tied to measurement of \nthe quality or quantity of information obtained.”  Kyllo , 533 U.S. at 35.  Although the \nintrusion at issue might not strike a person  as especially problematic , particularly in \nthe nascent Zoom era, the core protection afforded to the home, the lack of options, \ninconsistency in application of the policy, and short notice of the scan weigh in \nPlaintiff’s favor.  “ It may be that it is the obnoxious thing in its mildest and least \nrepulsive form; but illegitimate and unconstitutional pract ices get their first footing \nin that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of \nprocedure. ”  Silverman , 365 U.S. at 512 (quoting Boyd v. United States , 116 U.S. 616, \n635 (1886) ).   Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  21 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>22 II.C.  Government al Interests  \n Defendant ar gues that the room scams facilitate proctoring of tests and ensure \nacademic fairness and integrity.  ( ECF No. 29 , PageID #467.)   These practices help \ndetect other people or unauthorized study aids present in the room  which might  \nimproperly assist the exami nee and deter examinees  from availing themselves of \nthese and other forms of  unauthorized assistance .  (Id., PageID #460; ECF No. 34 , \nPageID #51 8.)  On this point, Plaintiff acknowledges that Defendant has a legitimate \npurpose in preserving the integrity of its test s.  (ECF No. 30 , PageID #490; ECF \nNo. 36, PageID #545 .)  The se considerations weigh in favor of Defendant.  \nII.D.  Efficacy of Means  \n Plaintiff argues that room scans are not necessary to preserve test integrity.  \n(ECF No. 30 , PageID #490.)   Plaintiff points to other procedural safeguards at \nDefendant’s disposal to guard against cheating  and ensure academic integrity .  \nSpecifically, these safeguards include employing proctors to monitor for suspicious \nmovement or  using proctoring programs  that perform functions like preventing \nstudents from accessing the internet or other programs during the test, recording \nstudents during tests , and using artificial intelligence to detect suspicious movement  \nor plagiarism.   (Id., PageID #491– 92.)  \nFurthe r, Plaintiff argues that room scans have  minimal value for preserving \ntest integrity  because there are numerous ways students could cheat that they would \nnot catch .  (Id. , PageID #492.)  For instance, students could access their cell phones \nor notes in another room, since Defendant does not require students to remain on camera for the duration of the test.  (Id., PageID #493 .)  Also, Plaintiff notes  that Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  22 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>23 Defendant does not require a room s can; rather, the decision is left to individual \nfaculty in their discretion —a policy that acknowledges that such means are not \nstrictly necessary , but one available option among many .  (Id. , PageID #490– 91.)   \nDefendant counters that Plaintiff’s proposed a lternatives would not fulfill the \ndetecti on and deterrent functions that room scans  do.  (ECF No. 34 , PageID #519.)   \nRegarding proctoring programs, Defendant argues that they are not  effective at \nachieving these purposes and that sometime s they are inappro priate for students \nwith disabilities.  ( Id.; see ECF No. 34 -1, PageID #523– 24.) \nThough reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment does not require \nemployin g the least intrusive means,  Earls, 536 U.S. at 837, the efficacy of the means \nDefendant has chosen to advance its purpose is a factor in determining \nreasonable ness.  Without question, other procedural safeguards would advance the \nsame purpose s—indeed, Cleveland State employs some of them.  Also, pedagogica l \nalternatives  to tests for assessing students , for instance, a final project or paper , \nmight minimize or eliminate the need for remote scans .  Plaintiff points to several \nways in which students may cheat regardless of the use of room scans .  Besides \npoint ing to the potential deterrent effect, Defendant does not offer much argument or \nevidence to support the efficacy of room scans.   Perhaps experience with room scans \nis too recent or not extensive enough to offer much in this regard.  Whatever the case, a record of s poradic and discretionary use of room scans does not permit a finding \nthat rooms scans are truly, and uniquely, effective at preserving test integrity.   \nAccordingly, this factor weighs in Plaintiff’s favor  too. Case: 1:21-cv-00500-JPC  Doc #: 37  Filed:  08/22/22  23 of 24.  PageID #: <pageID>24 * * * \n Based on consideration of these factors, individually and collectively, the Court \nconcludes that Mr. Ogletree’s privacy interest in his home outweighs Cleveland \nState’s interests in scanning his room.  Accordingly, the Court determines that \nCleveland State’s practice of conducting room scans is unreasonable under the Fourth \nAmendment.  \nCONCLUSION  \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES  Defendant’s motion for \nsummary judgment and GRANTS  Plaintiff’s motion.  The Court DIRECTS  counsel \nto confer on the appropriate next steps , including on the propriety of entering a \ndeclaratory judgment or injunction  and the proper scope for either,  and to submit a \nshort joint status report no later than September 12, 2022.  \n SO ORDERED.  \nDated:   August 22, 2022 \n  \nJ.

The court previously dismissed the claim due to insufficient facts but has allowed Mantha to amend his complaint following new evidence that QuoteWizard used an AI-driven service by Drips LLC to send automated messages.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether QuoteWizard violated the TCPA by using an Automatic Telephone Dialing System (ATDS) without the plaintiff's prior consent to send text messages.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court allowed the plaintiff to amend the complaint to include new allegations based on information that the messages were sent using an AI-driven automated texting service. The amended complaint plausibly states a claim under the TCPA which should be explored further through discovery.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone is mad because they got a robot-typed text message they didn't ask for, saying it was sent illegally. The court wasn't sure at first if a robot really sent it, but new info shows that fancy tech, like a super-smart robot, was likely used.

Doc. No. 1 .1  On March 16, 2020, the Court dismissed Count I of Plaintiff’s \ncomplaint, which  had alleged a violation of the TCPA’s automated calling provisions , for failing  \nto allege sufficient facts from which such a  violation could plausibly be inferred with respect to \nthe two text messages at issue in this case.  Doc. No. 30 .  Following the Rule 16 conference  on \nApril 7, 2020 , the Court ordered that the initial phase of discovery in this case would be limited  to \nthe gating issue of whether Plaintiff had in fact consented to be conta cted by QuoteWizard.   See \nDoc.  No. 47.  \n \n1 Citations to “Doc. No. __” reference documents appearing on the court’s electronic docketing \nsystem; pincites are to the page numbers in the ECF header.  Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 1 of 122 \n Now pending before the Court are : (a) Plaintiff’s motion to amend the complaint to re -\nplead a violation of the TCPA’s automa ted calling provisions based on new fact s discovered  only \nafter the Court’s order dismissing that claim (Doc. No. 45 ); (b) several discovery disputes relating \nto the proposed amende d complaint and to the scope of discovery permitte d in the present phase \n(Doc. Nos. 51- 53, 70 ); and (c)  a motion to extend the deadline to complete fact discovery during \nthis first phase of the proceedings ( Doc. No. 71 ), with an accompanying motion for leave to file a \nreply ( Doc. No. 74 ).  The Court addresses each i n turn.    \nI. DISCUSSION  \n \nA. Plaintiff’s Motion to Amend the Complaint  (Doc. No. 45 ) \nPursuant to Rule 15(a)(2), Plaintiff moves  to amend his complaint to re-plead  that the text \nmessage s at issue in this case were generated and sent to him by means of an automatic telepho ne \ndialing system (ATDS) in violation of the TCPA.  Doc. No. 45 .  The Supreme Court has made it \nclear that the standard for allowing amendments under Rule 15(a) is liberal:  \nRule 15(a) declares that leave to amend “ shall be freely given when justice so \nrequires ”; this mandate is to be heeded. . . . If the underlying facts or circumstances \nrelied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded \nan opportunity to test his claim on the merits.   In the absence of any apparent or \ndeclared reason —such as undue delay, bad faith or dil atory motive on the part of \nthe movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously \nallowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the \namendment, futility of amendment, etc. —the leave sought should, as the rules  \nrequire, be “ freely given. ” \n \nFoman v. Davis , 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)  (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)).  \nThe parties’ arguments with respect to  the motion to amend ( Doc.  No. 45 ) address  a single \nquestion: whether Plaintiff’s  proposed amended complaint alleges sufficient facts from which an \nATDS violation may plausibly be inferred.  The TCPA makes it unlawful “to make any call (other \nthan a call made for emergency purposes or made wit h the prior express consent of the called Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 2 of 123 \n party) using an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial or prerecorded voice . . . to any \ntelephone number assigned to a . . . cellular telephone service.”  47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)(iii).  The \nstatute d efines an automatic telephone dialing system (ATDS) as “equipment which has the \ncapacity —(A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential \nnumber generator; and (B) to dial such numbers.”  47 U.S.C. § 227(a)(1).2   \nAs the Court stated previously when dismissing the ATDS claim in the initial complaint, \nPlaintiff must plausibly  allege that defendant (1)  used an ATDS (2)  to call (or text) a cellular \ntelephone number.  Doc. No. 30 at 1- 2.  The Court dismissed the ATDS claim after determining \nthat the complaint failed to plausibly allege the use of an ATDS.  Id. at 2-3.   \nAfter the Court dismissed Plaintiff’ s original ATDS claim, Plaintiff learned through \nDefendant’s initial disclosures that the entity that sent the text messages at issue in this case is \nDrips LLC, a company that, according to its website, provides automated text telemarketing \nservices to businesses by using artificial intelligen ce and computer bots to interact with consumers \nvia text message in a way that is designed to mimic a human interaction.  Doc. No. 46 at 4 .  \nReflecting this info rmation, Plaintiff’s proposed amended complaint alleges in pertinent part that \n(a) QuoteWizard engaged Drips to send consumers automated texts by means of technology that \nuses artificial intelligence and computer bots ; (b) Drips’s technology allows a computer to \nautomatically interact with consumers  via text message in a way that appears to be personalized \nand that mimics human in teraction; (c)  the entire text exchange is automated, allowing a computer \nto interact with and respond to  the text recipient without human intervention; (d)  consumers who \n \n2 Defendant does not contest that the ATDS prohibition applies to text messages.  In any event, \nthe FCC said in 2003 that the TCPA’s restrictions on “ mak[ing] any call” using an ATDS \nencompass the sending of text messages.  See In re Rules and Regulations Implementing the \nTelephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (2003 Order), 18 FCC Rcd. 14014, 14115, 2003 FCC \nLEXIS 3673 ¶ 165 (2003).   Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 3 of 124 \n receive automated texts from Drips are not interacting with a human being but  are ins tead \ninteracting  with a bot designed to appear to be  a human being; (e)  Drips uses the \ntelecommunications systems and technology of Ytel Dialer; and (f)  the Ytel Dialer has the capacity \nto store or produce telephone numbers to be called, either using a random or sequential number \ngenerator or by generating  the telephone numbers from a list or database of numbers, and to dial \nsuch numbers without human intervention.  See Doc. No. 46- 1 ¶¶ 26-29, 35- 37.   \nThe proposed Amended Complaint plausibly alleges that QuoteWizard  employs third \nparties who provide text messaging services that rely on the use of an automated system to send \ntext messages to cell phone s.  Id.  ¶¶  35-37.  Whether that allegation, standing alone, suffices to \nallege plausibly the use of an ATDS raises at least two questions : first, whether an ATDS is \nimplicated only when calling numbers generated by a random or sequential number generator , as \nsuggested by the Thi rd and District of Columbia Circuits,  see Dominguez v. Yahoo, Inc. , 894 F.3d \n116, 121 (3d. Cir. 2018), ACA Int’l v. FCC, 885 F.3d 687 (D.C. Cir. 2018), or merely by the \nautomated calling of stored numbers , as held by the Second and Ninth Circuits,  see Duran v. \nLa Boom Disco, 955 F.3d 279, 284- 85 (2d Cir. 2020);  Duguid v. Facebook, Inc. , 926 F.3d 1146, \n1151 (9th Cir. 2019) , cert. granted sub nom. Facebook, Inc. v. Duguid, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 3559  \n(2020) .  See also  Gonzalez v. Hosopo Corp. , 371 F. Supp. 3d 26, 31 -34 (D. Mass. 2019) (Saylor, \nJ.) (discussing circuit split and “conclud[ ing] that the phrase ‘using a random or sequential number \ngenerator ’ modifies only the verb ‘produce’  and not the verb ‘store. ’  Therefore, to qualify as an \nATDS under the TCPA, a device need only have the capacity to do one of the following: either \n(1) ‘store . . . telephone numbers to be called’  and ‘dial such numbers, ’ or (2)  ‘produce telephone \nnumbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator ’ and ‘dial such numbers. ’”).  Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 4 of 125 \n Whatever the resolution of the first question, the use of an ATDS also raises the question \nof whether the additional allegations set forth in the proposed complaint suffice .3  The Court rejects \nDefendant ’s contentions  that (a)  allegations Defendant asserts are wrong or incorrect ought not be \nconsidered and (b) allegations deriving from internet research cannot form the basis of non-\nconclusory factual allegations to support a claim.  See Doc. No. 63 at 7- 10.   \nUnder the totality of the circumstances  as well as the uncertainty regarding the \ninterpretation of the statute , the Court concludes that the proposed amended complaint plausibly \nstates a claim in Court I (the only dis puted count) and that the potentially complicated legal issues \nraised by the pleading are best resolved on the complete factual record developed in the course of \ndiscovery.   The Court  therefore  ALLOWS  Plaintiff’s motion to amend the complaint ( Doc. \nNo. 45).   \nB. The Parties’ Discovery Disputes (Doc. Nos. 51- 53, 70 ) \nPreviously, at the urging of D efendant, the Court bifurcated discovery in this case with the \nfirst phase culminating in an anticipated motion  (or cross -motions) for summary judgment solely \non the question of consent with a subsequent second phase addressing all other issues.  After \ncareful consideration of the various submissions by the parties regarding their myriad disputes, the \nCourt now concludes that Phase I of discovery should address all issues related to Plaintiff’s \nindividual claims  and that class discovery occur in Phase II.  The Court addresses the discovery \ndisputes in light of this ruling.  \n \n3 The Court notes that if the TCPA  requires dialing  numbers generated by a random or sequential \nnumber generator,  and not  merely  the automatic dialing  of stored numbers,  then the proposed \namended complaint  likely falls shor t in light of the specific allegations that the two texts at issue \naddress the Plaintiff by his first name “Joe .”  See Doc. No. 46- 1 ¶ 51. Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 5 of 126 \n 1. Dispute regarding s ubpoena  to third party Drips ( Doc. No. 51 ) \nRequest Nos. 5- 15 relate to Plaintiff’s ATDS claim ; the objection that the requests concern \na dismissed claim is now moot.  To the extent  disputes remain over the scope of these  requests or \nwhether they fall within Phase I or Phase II of these proceedings , the parties may raise those \ndisputes to the Court in the course of discovery.  \nRequest No. 1  is ALLOWED  IN PART because the information sought  is relevant given \nDefendant’s discl osure that the text messages at issue were generated and sent by Drips, but is \noverly broad to the extent it is not related to the two text messages at issue in this case .  The request \nis ALLOWED to the extent it is limited to the two text messages at issu e here.   \nRequest No. 2 is ALLOWED  IN PART to the same extent as Request No. 1 .  \nRequest No. 3 is ALLOWED  . \nRequest No. 4 is ALLOWED  IN PART to the same extent as Request No. 1 . \nRequest No. 16  is DENIED  WITHOUT PREJUDICE as Plaintiff has not explained the \npurpose or basis for the request.  \n2. Dispute concerning the scope of discovery permitted in the present phase  \n(Doc.  No. 52 ) \n \nDefendant seeks to take discovery re garding: “ (1) whether Plaintiff’s cell phone qualifies \nas a ‘ residential ’ line for the purposes of a do- not-call claim;  (2) whether the texts were ‘telephone \nsolicitations ’; and (3)  whether the conversational exchange between Plaintiff and QuoteWizard is \nwithin the ambit of the TCPA. ”  Doc. No. 52  at 2.  In light of the Court’s expansion of the scope \nof Phase I, these requests are ALLOW ED. \n3. Dispute concerning P laintiff’s discovery responses  (Doc. No. 53 ) \n \nThe parties’ “General Dispute No. 1” merely repeats the dispute at issue in their preceding \njoint status report  and has been resolved above in this Order.   Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 6 of 127 \n The parties’ “General Dispute No. 2” concerns  whether Defendant is permitted to seek \ndiscovery regarding Plaintiff’s attorney’s knowledge of or involvement in the events giving rise to \nthis litigation.  Defendant  may obtain reasonable discovery, subject to privilege, as to the role, if \nany, of Plaintiff’s counsel in the giving of consent or the two text messages alleged in the \nComplaint and forming the basis of this lawsuit.    \nThe parties’ “General Dispute No. 3” concerns  “[w]hether Plaintiff is required to \n(1) produce documents evidencing his brow ser and search history, and/or (2)  produce his \nelectronic devices that he owned or used at the relevant time periods for inspection by \nQuoteWizard.”  Doc. No. 53 at 6 .  The Court ALLOWS  the first request to the extent that Plaintiff \nshall produce responsive entries from both his browser history (all browsers) and his search history \n(same) to the extent these histories exist in the ordinary course.  Plaintiff is not required t o retrieve \nthem from deleted space, backups , etc.  The Court DENIES the second request as there is no basis \nto require the production of electronic devices ; nothing in this ruling precludes D efendant from \nseeking discovery from these devices.   However, not hing in this ruling permits Plaintiff to \nwithhold information or documents extracted from any of his devices in the course of this case \nunless protected by privilege.  Further, if Plaintiff relies upon an expert evaluation of the devices, \nDefendant will be  afforded a reasonable opportunity for its expert, if it elects to retain one, to \ninspect the devices.  \nThe parties’ “General Dispute No. 4” concerns “[w]hether Plaintiff is required to identify \nthe IP addresses for his electronic devices owned or used at t he relevant time periods.”  Doc. No.  53 \nat 11 .  As this topic  is relevant to Plaintiff’s individual claim, the Court ALLOWS the  requested \ndiscovery during this phase of the proceedings . Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 7 of 128 \n The parties’ “General Dispute No. 5” concerns “[w]hether  Plaintiff is required to identify \nwhether he has withheld c ertain information and documents on privilege grounds and, if so, \nproduce a privilege log.”   Doc. No. 53 at 12 .  Plaintiff asserts that “[c]onsistent with the Parties[’ ] \njoint understanding that c orrespondence between counsel and third parties in relation to subpoenas \nare [sic] not discoverable, Plaintiff’s counsel represents that no documents are being withheld on \nthe basis of privilege. ”  Id.  Defendant denies that the parties have an understanding that  \ncorrespondence between counsel and third parties in relation to subpoenas is not discoverable  and \nseeks to compel such correspondence.  Id.   Because the requested discovery pertains  to Plaintiff’s \nindividual claim,  the Court ALLOWS  Defen dant’s request during this phase of the proceedings.    \nThe parties’ “General Dispute No. 6” appears to be resolved.  Plaintiff shall serve \nsupplemental answers to the applicable interrogatories in accordance with his stated posi tion.  See  \nDoc. No. 53 at 13 . \nDefendant ’s Interrogatory No. 21  asks that Plaintiff “ describe any and all information you \nor anyone on your behalf has  concerning your allegation that the consent provided on \nwww.snappyautoinsurance.com on August 5, 2019 using your personal information is fraudulent .”  \nDoc. No. 53 at 13 .  Plaintiff responds that “[o] ther than attesting to under oath, which he has done \nalready r epeatedly —that he did not visit www.snappyautoinsurace.com and consent to receive \nspam  texts from QuoteWizar d, the Plaintiff is personally unaware of other facts supporting  \ncounsel’s claim that the consent evidence relied on by QuoteWizard is fraudulent .”  Plaintiff shall \nserve a supplemental answer to the interrogatory in accordance with his stated position.  S ee Doc. \nNo. 53 at 14 .   \nAs for disclosing any information “anyone acting on [Plaintiff’s] behalf has concerning” \nthe consent issue, Plaintiff responds: “ Without  waiving privilege, the factual basis for the assertion Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 8 of 129 \n by plaintiff’s counsel’s that the consent  claim is a fraud is aptly described above. ”  Id.   To the \nextent Plaintiff is relying on information  that anyone acting on Plaintiff’s behalf may have to \nsupport Plaintiff’s allegation that Plaintiff’s consent was fraudulent, Plaintiff shall disclose that \ninformation in his supplemental answer to Interrogatory No. 21.  Plaintiff shall also produce the \nrelevant documents as ordered below .  \n4. Dispute regarding Plaintiff’s discovery responses ( Doc. No. 70 ) \n \nThe parties’ “General Disputes Nos. 1 and  2” in their Joint Status Report, Doc. No. 70  at 2, \nrepeat their “General Disputes Nos. 3 and 4” presented in their Joint Status Report, Doc. No. 53 at \n6-12, which are addressed above,  so no further ruling is required.    \nThe parties ’ “General Dispute No. 3 ” concerns “[w] hether Plaintiff is required to disclose \nthe basis for his allegation that his consent was fraudulent (as opposed to legally \ninoperative/insufficient) .”  Doc. No. 70 at 2 .  This dispute is resolve d by the Court’s Orders \nregarding Defendant’s  Interrogatory No. 21 noted above.   \nIn Request for Production No. 31, Defendant sought  search and browser history from \nPlaintiff’s various electronic devices and , after receiving no responsive documents , now seeks \nfollow -up information regarding whether Plaintiff conducted any searches , etc., on the dates in \nquestion (June 25- 27, 2019 ), and whether the Plaintiff deleted such information or failed to \npreserve it.  Plaintiff declines to provide the requested information  on the grounds  that the meet \nand confer process “is not an appropriate manner to pursue new discovery requests .”  Doc. No. 70 \nat 3.  Of course, no rule empowers a lawyer to require  the other side to provide further information \nin the course of the meet and confer process.  Nonetheless , there are many good reasons to do so \nand in the Court’s experience , lawyers do so regularly.  See generally  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  \nNonetheless, counsel will be able to obtain the answers to these questions in Plaintiff’s deposition, Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 9 of 1210 \n thus, nothing further is  ordered on this request at this time.   To the extent Plaintiff’s answers to \nthese questions in his deposition reasonably result  in supplemental interrogatories or document \nrequests, Defendant may propound such requests  within thirty days after obtaining the final \ntranscript of the deposition.    \nIn Request for Production No. 32, Defendant seeks “ [a]ny and all documents evidencing \nthe vehicle(s) you owned or drove, or anyone else in your household owned or drove, as of June \n25, 2019 through August 5, 2019 .”  Doc. No. 70 at 3 .  The focus of this request is a 2005 Chevrolet \nTrailblazer listed on certain documentation.  After a lengthy objection regarding the meaning of \nconsent that does not address the issue of connecting an existing consent to a particular person \nwhen challenged, Plaintiff’s counsel represents that neither Plaintiff nor his family members \nowned a “ 2004  Chevrolet Trailb lazer.”  Doc. No. 70 at 5 .   This is insufficient.  Plaintiff shall \nadmit or deny under oath whether as of June 25, 2019 through August 5, 2019, or any part of that \nperiod, Plaintiff or someone in his household owned or drove a Chevrolet Trailblazer.  If P laintiff \nadmits that assertion , then Plaintiff shall identify the year, plate number (with state ) and VIN of \nthe vehicle.  The Request is otherwise DENIED.  \nIn Request for Production No. 33 , Defendant seeks  “[a]ny and all documents showing, \nevidencing, or referencing the IP address for any and all computers, cell phones, or other electronic \ndevices used by you on June 25, 26, and 27, 2019.”  Doc. No. 70 at 5 .  The Court  addressed this \ndispute above and it is ALLOWE D as described therein.  \nIn Request for Production No. 35, Defendant seeks “[a]ny and all documents concerning, \nevidencing, or relating to an assertion that consent provided by Joseph Mantha on \nwww.snappyautoinsurance.com on June 26, 2019 was fraudulent. ”  Doc. No. 70 at 5 .  The Court \nALLOWS this requested discovery and for the reasons given above.  Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 10 of 1211 \n In Request for Production No. 36 , Defendant seeks “[a]ny and all documents showing, \nevidencing, relating to, or concerning the name of your home internet service provider (ISP) in \nJune through August, 2019.”  Doc. No. 70 at 5 .  The Court ALLOWS this requested discovery as \nit is relevant to Plaintiff’s individual claim .   \nIn Request for Production No. 38 , Defendant seeks “[a]ny  and all documents showing, \nevidencing, relating to, or concerning the IP address associated with your home internet service in \nJune through August, 2019. ”  Doc. No. 70 at 6 .  For the reasons already given above, the Court \nALLOWS this requested discovery.  \n5. Defendant’s  Motion to Extend the Scheduling Order ( Doc. No. 71 ) and for Leave \nto Reply ( Doc. No. 74 ) \n \nThe motion to extend the scheduling order ( Doc. No. 71 ) is ALLOWED  with the fact \ndiscovery period in Phase I extended to September 15, 2020.  The Court has enlarged the scope of \nPhase I , the parties have raised substantial discovery disputes and have additional discovery to \nundertake.   Defendant’s motion for leave to reply to Plainti ff’s opposition to Defendant’s motion \nto extend the  scheduling order  (Doc. No. 74 ) is ALLOWED.  \n6. Other  \n \nThe Court refers this ca se to Chief Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley for all purposes \nincluding revising the governing schedule,  resolution of all non- dispositive motions, \nrecommending appropriate resolutions of all dispositive motions and managing all pretrial ma tters.  \nAt various points, Plaintiff has raised concerns regarding the preservation of certain class \ndiscovery.  To the extent not resolve d by the parties, nothing in the bifurcation of discovery \nprecludes Chief Judge Kelley from ensuring any appropriate resolution.   Case 1:19-cv-12235-LTS   Document 75   Filed 07/30/20   Page 11 of 1212 \n II. CONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff’s motion to amend the Complaint  (Doc. No. 45 ) is \nALLOWED; Defendant’s motion for leave to file a reply ( Doc. No. 74 ) is ALLOWED ; the parties ’ \nvarious discovery disputes (Doc. Nos. 51- 53, 70) are resolved as ordered above; and the case is \nreferred to Chief Magistrate Judge M. Page Kelley  for all purposes.  \n \nSO ORDERED.  \n \n \n         /s/ Leo T.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Cody Clark filed a class action lawsuit against Microsoft Corporation, alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The lawsuit concerns the use of Brainshark's AI-driven video coaching software, which employs Microsoft's Azure cloud services and Azure Cognitive Services to analyze facial expressions, allegedly involving biometric data. The court granted in part Microsoft's motion to dismiss, allowing Clark's claim regarding possession of biometric data under BIPA's section 15(a) to proceed, while dismissing other claims with leave to amend.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Microsoft is liable under BIPA for actively obtaining, possessing, profiting from, or disseminating biometric data allegedly processed through its services.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed Clark's claims under sections 15(b) and 15(d) of BIPA due to insufficient allegations that Microsoft took active steps to obtain or disseminate biometric data. The section 15(c) claim was dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, as Clark failed to demonstrate personal harm from the alleged profiting. However, the court allowed the section 15(a) claim to proceed, finding plausible allegations regarding Microsoft's possession and control over biometric data.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Cody Clark sued Microsoft because a software tool he used for work, which helps evaluate his sales pitches, might have used his face data incorrectly. He claimed Microsoft did things like making money from his face data without his permission. The judge said Clark didn't show enough to prove all his claims, like Microsoft actively trying to get or share his face data. But, one claim can continue because it's possible that Microsoft had control over the data, which might mean they have some responsibility. Clark can try to fix his complaints and bring them back to court.",

Comp. Stat. 14/1 et seq. Microsoft \nnow moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss \neach of Clark’s claims. I have subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d). For the following reasons, the motion is granted in part and denied in part. \nI. \n According to the complaint, while Clark worked as a salesperson for CONMED, he used “video-based coaching” software Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 1 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n provided by Brainshark, Inc. (“Brainshark”). Compl., ECF 1-1 ¶¶ 8, \n45. That software allows a salesperson to record a video of himself and upload it to Brainshark’s platform, which then automatically generates feedback about his “elevator pitch.” Id. ¶ 9. To provide \nthis feedback, Brainshark’s software analyzes facial expressions \nusing facial geometry scans from the uploaded video. Id. ¶¶ 9–10.\n1 \n Brainshark’s software allegedly “interfaces with and/or integrates” two Microsoft products: its Azure cloud services (“Azure”) and Azure Cognitive Services applications (“ACS”). Id. \n¶ 8. “Public cloud[s]” like Azure “allow[] users to, inter alia , \nbuild and deploy applications; store data; deliver software on demand; and analyze data using machine learning and artificial \nintelligence.” Id. ¶ 7. ACS “help[s] developers build cognitive \nsolutions (that can see, hear, speak, and analyze) into their applications.” Id. \n In addition to the allegations in the complaint, Microsoft requests that I take judicial notice of its Products and Services Data Protection Addendum (“DPA”), ECF 16-1, which it says applies to Azure and ACS. Clark does not oppose consideration of this document, and in fact uses it in some of his arguments. Because \nthe document is publicly available, it is a “matter of public \n \n1 A BIPA case against Brainshark in this district was recently \ndismissed by stipulation of the parties. See Wilk v. Brainshark, \nInc., No. 1:21-cv-4794 (N.D. Ill. July 26, 2023), ECF 57. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 2 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n record,” and I will take judicial notice of it for purposes of \nthis motion to dismiss. See U.S. ex rel. Suarez v. AbbVie, Inc. , \n503 F. Supp. 3d 711, 721–22 (N.D. Ill. 2020) (citing Cause of \nAction v. Chi. Transit Auth. , 815 F.3d 267, 277 n.13 (7th Cir. \n2016)). \nII. \n“To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain \nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 \nU.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. \n544, 570 (2007)). “A claim is facially plausible ‘when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the \nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the \nmisconduct alleged.’” Law Offs. of David Freydin, P.C. v. Chamara , \n24 F.4th 1122, 1128 (7th Cir. 2022) (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at \n678). I accept well-pleaded facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiff’s favor, but I am “not bound to accept legal conclusions as true.” Burger v. County of Macon , 942 F.3d \n372, 374 (7th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted). \nA. \n Section 15(b) regulates entities that “collect, capture, \npurchase, receive through trade, or otherwise obtain” biometric Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 3 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n data.2 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(b). Microsoft maintains that \nClark’s section 15(b) claim should be dismissed because he failed to plausibly allege that Microsoft took an “active step” to obtain his biometric data. In response, Clark focuses only on whether \nMicrosoft “receive[d] through trade” or “otherwise obtain[ed]” the \ndata, and argues that section 15(b) does not require an active step and that, in any event, he has plausibly alleged one.  I agree with Microsoft and the weight of authority in this district that section 15(b) liability requires an active step in obtaining biometrics. See, e.g. , Jones v. Microsoft Corp. , No. 22-\ncv-3437, 2023 WL 130495, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 9, 2023) (applying “active step” requirement to section 15(b) claim); Patterson v. \nRespondus, Inc. , 593 F. Supp. 3d 783, 824 (N.D. Ill. 2022) (same); \nKing v. PeopleNet Corp. , No. 21 CV 2774, 2021 WL 5006692, at *8 \n(N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2021) (same); Jacobs v. Hanwha Techwin Am., \nInc., No. 21 C 866, 2021 WL 3172967, at *2 (N.D. Ill. July 21, \n2021) (same). The Illinois legislature premised BIPA sections 15(a), (c), (d), and (e) on “possession” of biometrics, but chose not to use that term in section 15(b). That choice matters. See \nChi. Teachers Union, Local No. 1 v. Bd. of Educ. of the City of \n \n2 Though BIPA defines “biome tric identifier” and “biometric \ninformation” independently, see 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/10, I use \nthem interchangeably in this opinion, along with the terms \n“biometric data” or “biometrics.” The terms’ distinctions make no \ndifference for present purposes. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 4 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n Chi., 963 N.E.2d 918, 925 (Ill. 2012) (“When the legislature \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same statute, courts presume that the legislature acted intentionally and purposely in the inclusion or \nexclusion, and that the legislature intended different meanings \nand results.” (citations omitted)).  \nThe term “otherwise obtain” is also best construed as \nrequiring something beyond passive possession or receipt. The \nparties put forth dueling dictionary definitions of the word “obtain”--Microsoft’s preferred definition makes the verb active, while Clark’s makes it passive. See Obtain , Black’s Law Dictionary  \n(11th ed. 2019) (“[t]o bring into one’s own possession; to procure, \nesp. through effort”); Vance v. Microsoft Corp. , 525 F. Supp. 3d \n1287, 1297 (W.D. Wash. 2021) (“‘[t]o come into the possession of,’ or ‘to get, acquire, or secure’” (quoting Obtain, Oxford English \nDictionary , https://www.oed.com/dictionary/obtain_v (last visited \nAugust 21, 2023))). But because “otherwise obtain” comes at the end of a list of active verbs,\n3 the more active definition is the \nbetter one here. See Pooh-Bah Enters., Inc. v. County of Cook , 905 \nN.E.2d 781, 799 (Ill. 2009) (“[W]hen a statutory clause \nspecifically describes several classes of persons or things and \n \n3 “Receive” alone need not be active, but to “receive through \ntrade” requires the active step of engaging in trade with some \nother entity. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 5 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n then includes ‘other persons or things,’ the word ‘other’ is \ninterpreted to mean ‘other such like.’” (citation omitted)).4 \nClark cautions that applying an active step requirement to \nsection 15(b) is tantamount to “rewrit[ing] [BIPA] to create new \nelements or limitations not included by the legislature,” in \ncontravention of Illinois Supreme Court caselaw. Cothron v. White \nCastle Sys., Inc. , -- N.E.3d --, 2023 WL 4567389, at *7 (Ill. Feb. \n17, 2023). Indeed, according to Clark,  the federal courts that had \npreviously observed such a requirement can no longer be considered good law after Cothron. But Cothron merely reiterated rules of \nstatutory construction that have been around for many years, and certainly since BIPA has been enacted. While true that section \n15(b) nowhere says the words “active step,” the statutory \nconstruction offered above shows that, “[u]nder a commonsense \nreading,” “the private entity must undertake some effort to collect or obtain biometric identifiers or information.” Jones, 2023 WL \n130495, at *3; see id.  (“[T]his concept simply describes the \nunifying characteristic among the verbs in the statute.”).  The complaint does not sufficiently allege that Microsoft took an active step in obtaining Clark’s biometric data. There are \n \n4 As for Clark’s argument that Microsoft receives his biometrics \nthrough trade, the complaint lacks allegations of a “transaction \nor swap” by which Microsoft received biometrics. See Trade, Black’s \nLaw Dictionary  (11th ed. 2019). Instead, I agree with Microsoft \nthat the allegations suggest it provided its technology in exchange \nfor payment by Brainshark. See Compl. ¶¶ 33–34. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 6 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n repeated allegations that, for Brainshark to conduct its analysis \nof sales employees, it “(1) collects, captures, and/or otherwise obtains; (2) stores; and/or (3) makes use of such individuals’ biometric identifiers (namely, scans of facial geometry) and \nbiometric information.” Compl. ¶¶ 10, 40; see also id.  ¶ 46 \n(similar). From there, Clark alleges that because “Brainshark’s software interfaces with and/or integrates Azure and/or ACS, Defendant Microsoft also (1) collects, captures, and/or otherwise obtains; (2) stores; and/or (3) makes use of such individuals’ biometric identifiers and biometric information.” Id. ¶¶ 11, 41; \nsee also  id. ¶¶ 13, 43, 47 (similar). That alone is a conclusory \njump, and the complaint does not elsewhere allege facts sufficient \nto draw the inference that Microsoft actively obtained Clark’s \nbiometrics. Indeed, the complaint makes clear that Microsoft provides technology to Brainshark and that Brainshark allegedly uses that technology to collect Clark’s biometrics. See, e.g. , id. \n¶ 7 (alleging that Azure is “a public cloud” that “allow[s] users \nto” perform various tasks (emphasis added)); id. ¶ 29 (describing \nACS as “cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services that help developers  build cognitive intelligence into applications” \nand “easily add cognitive features into their applications with \ncognitive solutions that can see, hear, speak, and analyze” (emphasis added) (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted)); see also  id. ¶¶ 28, 30–32. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 7 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n  Rivera v. Amazon Web Services  offers a helpful contrast. No. \n2:22-cv-00269, 2023 WL 4761481 (W.D. Wash. July 26, 2023). There, the court found sufficient for section 15(b) purposes the plaintiff’s allegations that the defe ndant could “access” and \n“extract” biometric data uploaded by an intermediary, and that it \nwas “involve[d] in the data collection process . . . beyond simply providing the technology to” another entity. Id. at *5; see also \nMayhall ex rel. D.M. v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc. , No. 2:21-cv-\n01473-TL, 2023 WL 2728292, at *1, *3 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 31, 2023) (finding active step where defendant “use[d] its computing power . . . to collect facial features vectors from face-scan data,” “construct[ed] a 3D face geometry of the user,” and “transmit[ted] \nthe [f]ace [g]eometry to [video game] players’ [g]aming \n[p]latforms”). Clark’s other cases are similarly distinguishable because in those cases, the defendants allegedly played active roles in obtaining biometrics. For example, in Johnson v. NCR \nCorp., the court upheld a section 15(b) claim where the plaintiff \nalleged the defendant actively managed, maintained, and stored biometric data and that defendant’s system itself captured the biometrics in the first place and used them to create templates \nthat could be employed for identification purposes. No. 22 C 3061, \n2023 WL 1779774, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 6, 2023). Here, as far as I can tell from the complaint, Microsoft provided technology to Brainshark, plus storage. That is not an active step. See Jones , Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 8 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n 2023 WL 130495, at *4 (finding providing storage did not constitute \n“active step”); Jacobs, 2021 WL 3172967, at *3 (finding provision \nof technology did not constitute “active step”); Namuwonge v. \nKronos, Inc. , 418 F. Supp. 3d 279, 286 (N.D. Ill. 2019) (same).5 \n Nor does the DPA help. Many of the portions Clark cites \ndescribe what Microsoft does with data in its possession, but as explained above, possessing data does not suffice for a section 15(b) claim. And though the DPA at one point references how “Personal Data processed by Microsoft in connection with providing the Products and Services is obtained,” DPA at 8, the DPA goes on to indicate that some such data is “sent to” Microsoft, id., which \nwould not constitute an active step. In any event, the complaint \nis silent on whether Microsoft “processes” the alleged biometric \ndata at issue here. Additionally, as used in the DPA, “obtained” could assume its passive, rather than active, meaning. I would need to make more than one speculative leap to infer that Microsoft took an active step to obtain Clark’s data based on the DPA.  \n \n5 In his response brief, Clark argues that Brainshark “has to \nprovide the relevant videos to Microsoft, from which Microsoft \nextracts biometric data using” Azure and ACS “before returning the \nbiometric data to Brainshark.” Resp., ECF 24 at 10 (citing Compl. \n¶¶ 13, 28, 33, 37–43). I do not understand the cited paragraphs of \nthe complaint to support that contention. To the extent he has a \ngood faith basis to allege that is what actually happens--that is, \nthat Brainshark sends the videos to Microsoft, Microsoft extracts \nbiometric data, and then sends the biometric data back to \nBrainshark--he should so allege in any amended complaint. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 9 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n B. \n Clark’s remaining claims, under sections 15(a), (c), and (d), each require that Microsoft was “in possession of” Clark’s biometrics. 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(a), (c), (d). The parties \nagree that the ordinary meaning of “possession” applies here, which \nis “‘the act or condition of having in or taking into one’s control or holding at one’s disposal.’” People v. Ward , 830 N.E.2d 556, \n560 (Ill. 2005) (quoting Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 1770 (1986)). \nConsidering the DPA, it is plausible that Microsoft was “in \npossession” of Clark’s biometric data. The DPA states that Microsoft “control[s] access to Customer Data and Professional \nServices Data (including any Personal Data therein).” DPA at 9.\n6 \nIn its reply brief, Microsoft does not address this portion of the DPA. And because the complaint alleges that Brainshark is hosted on Azure’s servers, see Compl. ¶ 35, I can reasonably infer that \nthe biometric data allegedly collected by Brainshark was on Microsoft’s servers and that, once there, Microsoft exercised some degree of control over access to that data. While data storage alone may be insufficient, storage of data together with the \n \n6 The DPA defines “Customer Data” to include “video” or “image \nfiles” “that are provided to Microsoft by” customers. DPA at 5. \n“Personal Data” includes information “specific to the physical \n[or] physiological . . . identity” of a natural person. Id. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 10 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n ability to control access to that data adequately pleads \npossession. \nC. \n Microsoft independently attacks Clark’s section 15(c) claim, \nasserting the complaint does not sufficiently allege that \nMicrosoft “sell[s], “lease[s], trade[s], or otherwise profit[s] from” his biometrics. 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(c). According to the complaint, Microsoft profited from Clark’s data by using it to “further refine its technologies and/or provide services to its clients.” Compl. ¶ 73.  But Clark has not sufficiently alleged an injury-in-fact to confer Article III standing with respect to this claim. “Standing \nis an element of subject-matter jurisdiction in a federal civil \naction,” Moore v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. , 908 F.3d 1050, 1057 (7th \nCir. 2018), and though Microsoft does not argue for dismissal or remand of this claim on those grounds, courts “have an independent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even in the absence of a challenge from any party,” Arbaugh \nv. Y & H Corp. , 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006) (citation omitted). The \nSeventh Circuit has characterized section 15(c) as a “general \nregulatory rule” that “no one may profit in the specified ways \nfrom another person’s” biometric data, and that pleading a bare violation of this provision is not enough for standing purposes. Thornley v. Clearview AI, Inc. , 984 F.3d 1241, 1246–47 (7th Cir. Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 11 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n 2021). In Thornley , the Seventh Circuit held that a section 15(c) \nplaintiff must allege more than that the defendant profited from their data; they must allege how that conduct harmed them individually. Id. at 1247. The Seventh Circuit identified examples \nof allegations a plaintiff could allege to establish injury-in-\nfact, like, “for example, that by selling her data, the collector has deprived her of the opportunity to profit from her biometric information”; “that the act of selling her data amplified the invasion of her privacy that occurred when the data was first collected, by disseminating it to some unspecified number of other people”; or that defendant’s use of the biometric data “raise[d] the cost” of using some other product or service, like a social \nmedia website. Id. \nClark’s complaint fails to plausibly allege more than a bare \nstatutory violation of section 15(c). Indeed, courts in this district have found allegations like those in Clark’s complaint insufficient for standing. See, e.g. , Gorgas v. Amazon.com, Inc. , \nNo. 22 CV 5159, 2023 4173051, at *2 (N.D. Ill. June 23, 2023) (dismissing claim where allegation was that “Amazon profits . . . by using this biometric data to improve the Rekognition technology \nthat Amazon uses itself and also sells to [various \norganizations]”); Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. , No. 21 C 3169, 2022 \nWL 952763, at *7 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 30, 2022) (same where allegation was that Amazon “used the images uploaded to Amazon Photos to train Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 12 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n Rekognition, which it then sold to third parties”); Patterson , 593 \nF. Supp. 3d at 816 (same where allegation was that defendant profited from biometric data by marketing their product). Even if Microsoft used Clark’s data to improve Azure and ACS, which it \nsells to other entities, that does not explain how doing so harmed \nClark. \nD. \n Finally, Microsoft argues that Clark’s section 15(d) claim fails because the complaint does not support that Microsoft “disclose[d], redisclose[d], or otherwise disseminate[d]” Clark’s data. 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/15(d). I agree. In his brief, Clark characterizes the requisite conduct as “Microsoft’s disclosure or \ndissemination of the biometric data to Brainshark so that \nBrainshark could provide its services,” Resp. at 19, a statement for which he cites to complaint paragraphs 33–35 and 46–49. I take those allegations to mean that Microsoft provides its Azure and ACS technology to Brainshark and other customers, but nothing in those allegations indicates disclosure, redisclosure, or dissemination of biometric data from Microsoft to Brainshark. See \nJones, 2023 WL 130495, at *5 (dismissing section 15(d) claim where \nno allegation that defendant disseminated data to “any third-party \ndata centers or any tangible third parties whatsoever”). And the fact that the DPA states that “Microsoft may hire Subprocessors to Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 13 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf,” DPA \nat 11, does not bring this claim from speculative to plausible. \nIII. \n For the foregoing reasons, Microsoft’s motion is denied with \nrespect to Clark’s section 15(a) claim. Clark’s claims under \nsection 15(b) and (d) are dismissed without prejudice for failure to state a claim. See O’Brien v. Vill. of Lincolnshire , 955 F.3d \n616, 628 (7th Cir. 2020) (noting plaintiff should usually have at least one opportunity to amend). His claim under section 15(c) is dismissed without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See Lauderdale-El v. Ind. Parole Bd. , 35 F.4th 572, \n576 (7th Cir. 2022) (“Dismissals for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction are necessarily without prejudice.” (citation \nomitted)). To the extent Clark is able, consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, to remedy the issues I identify above, he may file an amended complaint within 30 days of entry of this memorandum opinion and order. If no amended complaint is filed by then, his claims under sections 15(b) and (d) will be dismissed with prejudice and the section 15(c) claim will be severed and remanded to state court. \n \n   Case: 1:23-cv-00695 Document #: 33 Filed: 08/21/23 Page 14 of 15 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n  ENTER ORDER:  \n \n \n_____________________________ \n     Elaine E.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In this case, plaintiff Jordan Stein filed a putative class action against Clarifai, Inc., alleging unauthorized use of her photographs from OKCupid for developing facial recognition technology, thus violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) and claims of unjust enrichment. The court dismissed the case due to lack of personal jurisdiction over Clarifai in Illinois, as the company's minimal connections to the state were insufficient to establish such jurisdiction. AI is central to the case as Clarifai used AI technologies to extract and utilize biometric information from photos for facial recognition purposes.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the Illinois court has personal jurisdiction over Clarifai, Inc. based on the company's alleged unauthorized use of biometric information from residents of Illinois in developing facial recognition technology.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it does not have personal jurisdiction over Clarifai, Inc. because the company's contacts with Illinois (such as sales of its demographic model to a small number of Illinois customers) were not sufficient to establish minimum contacts required for jurisdiction, leading to the dismissal of the complaint without prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine someone takes your picture from a social app without asking and uses it to teach computers to recognize faces. You want to sue the company doing this, but the court says you can't sue them here because they don't do enough business in your state to be brought to court there. This case got dropped because the company wasn't connected enough to your state, even though they took your picture without asking.",

Ellis   \nCLARIFAI, INC.,  ) \n )   \nDefendant.  ) \n \nOPINION AND ORDER \nAfter learning that Defendant Clarifai, Inc. (“Clarifai ”), a technology company based in \nNew York , collected photographs from her OKCupid profile and used her facial information for \nprofit without her consent, Plaintiff Jordan Stein filed this putative class action against Clarifai.  \nStein alleges that Clarifai violated  §§ 15(a), (b), and (c) of the Illinois Biometric Information \nPrivacy Act (“BIPA”) , 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 14/1 et seq.  She also brings a claim for unjust \nenrichment.  Clarifai now moves the Court to dismiss the complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction  under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2)  or, in the alternative, for failure to \nstate a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).  Bec ause Stein has not alleged sufficient contacts to show \nClarifai directly targeted Illinois , the Court does not have jurisdiction over it  and so dismisses \nStein’s complaint without prejudice .   \nBACKGROUND\n1 \n Clarifai , a technology company  incorporated in Delaware and  based in New York , \nspecializ es in artificial intelligence.  It created a face database (the “database”) to develop and \n                                                 \n1 In addressing Clarifai’s  motion to dismiss, the Court is not limited to the pleadings. See Purdue \nResearch Found. v. Sanofi -Synthelabo, S.A., 338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. 2003).  Therefore, the Court Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 1 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n train algorithms used in its facial recognition technology .  In doing so, Clarifai created thousands \nof uni que face templates by scanning biometric information contained in photographs housed in \nthe database and extracting the unique geometry of each face detected therein.  Clarifai also \nprovides pre -trained visual recognition models, including a demographic model, that can \nrecognize certain attributes in an image.  Since May 2018, Clarifai may have  sold fifty -eight \ndemographic models to two customers located in Illinois.  These sales brought in approximately seven cents in revenue, as Clarifai  bills its  custome rs at a rate of $1.20 per $1,000 operations.  \nOn July 13, 2019, the New York Time s published an article that revealed that Clarifai \nbuilt the database from  OKCupid profile pictures.  The article further revealed that Clarifai \nsigned an agreement with a larg e social media company to use its users’ images for training \nfacial recognition algorithms.  According to OKCupid, Clarifai contacted it  in 2014 in hopes of \ncollaborating on artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology.  Clarifai gained access  \nto OKCupid users ’ profile photographs from one of its investors, Corazon, a Chicago -based \nventure capital fund, and its principals, Sam Yagan and Max Krohn, who  founded OKCupid.  \nKrohn used his personal email account to provide the photographs  to Clarifai’s chief executive \nofficer, Matthew Zeiler .\n2   \n                                                 \ndraws  the facts from the complaint  and the additional documents  submitted by the parties.  The Court \nresolves all factual conflicts and draws all reasonable inferences in Stein’s  favor.  Id. at 782– 83. \n \n2 The parties filed their briefs and exhibits under seal , also providing redacted versions .  If the Court \nrefers to a sealed document,  it attempts to do so without revealing any information that could be \nreasonably deemed confidential.  Nonetheless, if the Court discusses confidential information, it has done \nso because it is necessary to explain the path of its reasoning.  See In re Spe cht, 622 F.3d 697, 701 (7th \nCir. 2010) (“Documents that affect the disposition of federal litigation are presumptively open to public \nview, even if the litigants strongly prefer secrecy, unless a statute, rule, or privilege justifies \nconfidentiality.”); Un ion Oil Co. of Cal. v. Leavell , 220 F.3d 562, 568 (7th Cir. 2000) (explaining that a \njudge ’s “opinions and orders belong in the public domain”).  Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 2 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n In 2013, Stein, an Illinois resident, signed up for an account on OKCupid and uploaded \nroughly five digital photographs of herself to create her user profile; to date, Stein still uses the \napplication.  Because Stein’s account was active at the time Clarifai obtained profile photographs to create its database, Clarifai has used Stein ’s profile photographs in its  database.  At no time \ndid Clarifai inform Stein of the use of her photographs to collect, ca pture, receive, store, or use \nher facial information.  Instead, Stein learned that Clarif ai had gained access to her OKCupid \nprofile photographs from  the New York Times profile of Clarifai .   \nClarifai asserts it has never developed a business relationship with OKCupid and has no \nknowledge of where OKCupid users are located.  Zeiler states that Clarifai operates a globally \naccessible website, and while the website is accessible in Illinois, Clarifai does not target its \nwebsite to residents in Illinois .  Clar ifai is not registered to do business in Illinois, has no offices \nor employees in Illinois, has never had property, employees or operations in Illinois, and does not maintain a place of business in Illinois.  Zeiler indicates that Clarifai does not target its \nmarketing, sales, or commercial activity towards Illinois, nor does it specifically develop or train facial recognition or artificial technology in Illinois.    \nLEGAL STANDARD  \n A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) challenges the Court’s jurisdiction over a party.  \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  When a defendant raises a Rule 12(b)(2) challenge, “the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating the existence of jurisdiction.”  Curry  v. Revolution Labs., LLC , 949 \nF.3d 385, 392 (7th Cir. 2020) (citation omitted).  If the Court rules on the Rule 12(b)(2) motion without an evidentiary hearing, the plaintiff need only establish a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction.  Id . at 392–93; N . Grain Mktg., LLC v. Greving, 743 F.3d 487, 491 (7th Cir. 2014).  \nIn resolving a Rule 12(b)(2) motion, the Court “accept[s] as true all well -pleaded facts alleged in Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 3 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n the complaint,” Felland v. Clifton , 682 F.3d 665, 672 (7th Cir. 2012), and “reads the complaint \nliberally with every inference drawn in favor of [the] plaintiff,” GCIU -Emp. Ret. Fund v. \nGoldfarb Corp., 565 F.3d 1018, 1020 n.1 (7th Cir. 2009).  However, if the defendant submits \n“evidence opposing the district court’s exercise of personal juris diction, the plaintiff must \nsimilarly submit affirmative evidence supporting the court’s exercise of jurisdiction.”  Matlin v. Spin Master Corp., 921 F.3d 701, 705 (7th Cir. 2019).  The Court “accept[s] as true any facts contained in the defendant’s affida vits that remain unrefuted by the plaintiff,” GCIU -Emp. Ret. \nFund, 565 F.3d at 1020 n.1, but resolves “any factual disputes in the [parties’] affidavits in favor of the plaintiff,” Felland, 682 F.3d at 672.   \nANALYSIS  \n Clarifai moves to dismiss Stein’s cla ims against it for four reasons: first, that the \ncomplaint lacks allegations sufficient to assert personal jurisdiction over it under Rule 12(b)( 2); \nsecond, if personal jurisdiction does exist , that BIPA does not have extraterritorial application; \nthird, t hat applying BIPA to Clarifai violates the Dormant Commerce Clause ; and finally, that \nStein’s unjust enrichment claim is duplicative  of the BIPA claims .  The Court need only address \nClarifai’s personal jurisdiction argument, as it is dispositive.   \n In diversity cases, the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant only if \npersonal jurisdiction would be proper in an Illinois court.  Hyatt Int’l Corp. v. Coco, 302 F.3d 707, 713 (7th Cir. 2002).  Illinois allows for personal jurisdiction to the full extent authorized by the Illinois and United States Constitutions.  KM Enters., Inc. v. Glob. Traffic Techs., Inc., 725 F.3d 718, 732 (7th Cir. 2013).  Although there may be theoretical differences between the federal and Illinois constitutiona l standards, the Seventh Circuit has observed that “no Illinois case has \nprovided a definitive explanation” of these differences.  Matlin , 921 F.3d at  705.  Moreover, both Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 4 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n constitutional standards essentially focus on whether exercising jurisdiction over a  defendant is \nfair and reasonable.  See  KM Enters. , 725 F.3d at 732.  Thus, a single inquiry into whether the \nUnited States Constitution permits jurisdiction suffices.  See, e.g., Curry , 949 F.3d at  393; \nIllinois v. Hemi Grp. LLC , 622 F.3d 754, 756–57 (7th Cir. 2010); see also Wesly  v. Nat’l  \nHemophilia Found., 2020 IL App (3d) 170569, ¶  16 (“ [I]t is generally true that, when federal due \nprocess concerns regarding personal jurisdiction are satisfied, so are Illinois due process \nconcerns.” (alteration in orig inal) (citation omitted)).  Jurisdiction is proper under the Due \nProcess Clause of the United States Constitution if the defendant has “certain minimum contacts \nwith [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’”  Int’l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (quoting Millikin v. Meyer , 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)).  Minimum contacts exist where “the \ndefendant’s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.”  World -Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. \n286, 297 (1980); Brook v. McCormley , 873 F.3d 549, 552 (7th Cir. 2017) . \nPersonal jurisdiction comes in two forms: general and specific .  uBI D, Inc. v. GoDaddy \nGrp., Inc., 623 F.3d 421, 425 (7th Cir. 2010) .  Stein  does not contend that this Court has general \njurisdiction over Clarifa i so the Court limits its analysis accordingly .  See  Doc. 52 at 5.  Specific \njurisdiction exists “when the defendant purposefully directs its activities at the forum state and the alleged injury arises out of those activities.”  Mobile Anesthesiologists Chicago, LLC v. \nAnesthesia Assocs. of Houston Metroplex, P.A., 623 F.3d 440, 444 (7th Cir. 2010).  The Court looks to the “defendant’s suit -related conduct” and its connection to the forum state; “a \ndefendant’s relationship with a plaintiff or third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.”  Walden v . Fiore , 571 U.S. 277, 283, 286 (2014); Philos Techs., Inc. v. Philos & D, Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 5 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n Inc., 802 F.3d 905, 915– 16 (7th Cir. 2015).  The Court considers “whether the conduct \nunderlying the claims was purposely directed at the forum state,” looking at whether Clarifai  \nengaged in “(1)  intentional conduct (or ‘intentional and allegedly tortious’ conduct); \n(2) expressly aimed at the forum state; (3) with the defendant’s knowledge that the effects would \nbe felt —that is, the plaintiff would be injured—in the forum state.”  Ta mburo  v. Dworkin , 601 \nF.3d 693, 702–03 (7th Cir. 2010) . \nStein argues that Clarifai has sufficient minimum contacts with Illinois because it \nobtained the profile photos from an Illinois -based company and it has market ed and s old the  \ndemographic model  to Illinois customers .  Clarifai  contends, however, that  while it has sold its \nproduct to a small number of Illinois customers, it merely runs an interactive website  that does \nnot specifically target Illinois residents  and has no other relevant ties to this state .  Instead, \naccording to Clarifai, the only connection to Illinois is the fact that Stein resides here.     \nHere, Stein alleges that  Clarifai committed a tortious act in Illinois by illegally obtaining \nimages of her and other Illinois OKCupid users  and subsequently us ing those photographs to \ntrain its facial recognition software in violation of BIPA.  The only alleged tie t o Illinois with \nrespect to Clarifai’s acquisition of the photographs is through Corazon, a Chicago- based venture \ncapital fund, and its principals, two of whom, Sam Yagan and Max Krohn, also founded OKCupid.  As jurisdictional discovery revealed, Zeiler, Cl arifai’s CEO, reached out to Krohn to \ninquire whether Clarifai could obtain access to OKCupid’s data, and eventually, Krohn provided this information to Zeiler from his personal email account.  Stein has not provided any basis to infer  that Krohn took this  action on behalf of Corazon or that Krohn otherwise has a connection \nto Illinois.\n3  And while Corazon invested in Clarifai, this relationship does not subject Clarifai to \n                                                 \n3 In fact, Clarifai states in its reply that Krohn is a resident of New York or New Jersey.  Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 6 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n jurisdiction in Illinois with respect to the claims at issue here; Clarifai’s contact s with Illinois \nmust come from its suit -related activity in the forum state, not from the activity of a third party , \nand so its  contractual relationship with Corazon, which does not appear to have any bearing on \nthe claims at issue here, is irrelevant to the specific jurisdiction analysis in this case .  See \nSalkauskaite v. Sephora USA, Inc., No. 18 -CV-08507, 2020 WL 2796122, at *4 (N.D. Ill. May \n30, 2020)  (a defendant’s “contacts also must come from the activity of the defendant, not from \nthe activity of the plaintiff or a third party ”); see also Purdue , 338 F.3d 773, 780 (7th Cir. 2003)  \n(“[I]t must be the activity of the defendant that makes it amenable to jurisdiction, not the \nunilateral activity of the plaintiff or some other entity. ” (citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz , \n471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985)) ).  Further, Stein has not rebutted Clarifai ’s representation that it does \nnot develop or train facial or artificial technology in Illinois  and has no knowledge of where the \nOKCupid users whose in formation it used reside .  See Gullen v. Facebook.com, Inc., No. 15 C \n7681, 2016 WL 245910, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 21, 2016)  (“Plaintiff alleges that Facebook uses \nfacial recognition technology on ‘ every user -uploaded photo,’  not just on photos uploaded in or \nby residents of Illinois .  Given this tacit admission that Facebook ’s alleged collection of \nbiometric information is not ta rgeted at Illinois residents, the [] ‘ contact ’ becomes simply that \nFacebook operates an interactive website available to Illinois residents. ” (citation omitted)).  \nTherefore, t he Court cannot find that Clarifai specifically targeted Illinois  in connection with its \nacquisition of OKCupid Illinois residents’ user profiles.    \nStein also argues  that Clarifai ’s sales of its demographic model  to two Illinois customers \ncreates the required minimum contacts with Illinois .  These two customers purchased access  to \nthe model  as many as fifty -eight  times  in the eighteen months before Stein filed suit , generating \napproximately  seven cents in revenue  for Clarifai .  Clarifai maintains that these purchases do not Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 7 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n show that Clarifai targeted its products, including the database, to Illinois customers and instead \nonly reflects that it operated an interactive website, which does not suffice to create jurisdiction in thi s state.   It also represents that it “does not target its marketing, sales, commercial activity, or \ndeploy its technology towards Illinois.”  Doc. 21 -1 ¶ 8.    \nThe Seventh Circuit has c autioned that courts “should be careful in resolving questions \nabout pe rsonal jurisdiction involving online contacts to ensure that a defendant is not haled into \ncourt simply because the defendant owns or operates a website that is accessible in the forum state.”  Hemi , 622 F.3d at 760; see also be2 LLC v. Ivanov , 642 F.3d 555, 558 (7th Cir. 2011) \n(“Beyond simply operating an interactive website that is accessible from the forum state, a defendant must in some way target the forum state ’s market.  If the defendant merely operates a \nwebsite, even a ‘highly interactive’ website,  that is accessible from, but does not target, the \nforum state, then the defendant may not be haled into court in that state without offending the Constitution.” (citations omitted) ).  Certainly , evidence of extensive sales from an interactive \nwebsite may  show that Clarifai has targeted Illinois so as to subject it to this Court’s jurisdiction .  \nSee Curry, 949 F.3d at 399 (7th Cir. 2020)  (court had j urisdiction  over  defendant who made sales \nto 767 customers  in the state  through multiple interactive websites).  But such evidence does not \nexist here.  While Stein relies on Hemi  in her personal jurisdiction argument, the facts of that \ncase make it distinguishable.  As opposed to the small amount of sales to two customers here, the defendant in Hemi  made an affirmative choice to allow sales in Illinois  by selling 300 packs of \ncigarettes, a heavily regulated product, to one Illinois resident while deliberately choosing not to sell cigarettes to residents of other states.  Hemi , 622 F.3d at 760.  Likewise in  Mutnick v. \nClearview AI, Inc. , not only did Clearview sell  biometric information to Illinois entiti es but it \nalso marketed its  user accounts  for its facial recognition database to the Illinois Secretary of State Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 8 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n and negotiated a contract with the Secretary of State.  No. 20- cv-0846, 2020 WL 4676667, at *2 \n(N.D.  Ill. Aug. 12, 2020) .  Stein has not presented any similar evidence.  Thus, the  miniscule \nnumber of transactions  at issue here, fifty -eight  sales to just two Illinois residents  that garnered \nClarifai only seven cents in revenue , without additional evidence  to show Clarifai targeted the \nforum state  cannot suffice  to subject Clarifai to  personal jurisdiction in this Court .  See Matlin , \n921 F.3d at 707 ( a single sale of a product without more evidence is not enough to assert \npersonal jurisdiction) ; Advanced Tactical  Ordnance Ss., LLC v. Real Action Paintball, Inc., 751 \nF.3d 796, 801 (7th Cir. 2014)  (“[I]t is unlikely that those few sales alone, w ithout some evidence \nlinking them to the allegedly tortious activity, would make jurisdiction proper.  To hold \notherwise would mean that a plaintiff could bring suit in literally any state where the defendant shipped at least one item.”  (citation omitted) ); be2, 642 F.3d at  559 (e vidence that twenty  Illinois \nresidents had opened accounts on the defendant’s interactive website . a “miniscule number of \nregistrants,”  did not create specific jurisdiction over the defendant, particularly where no \nevidence existed  that the defendant had targeted the state).   Because Stein has not demonstrated \nthat Clarifai  directed its suit- related actions at Illinois  so as to subject it to this Court’s \njurisdiction , even after engaging in jurisdictional discovery, the Court must dismiss her \ncomplaint for lack of jurisdiction .\n4   \n  \n                                                 \n4 Because the Court  concludes that it lacks personal jurisdiction over Clarifai, it does not address \nClarifai’s alternative arguments for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).  Case: 1:20-cv-01937 Document #: 66 Filed: 03/16/21 Page 9 of 10 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, the Court grants Clarifai’s  motion to dismiss [ 20].  The \nCourt dismisses Stein’s claims without prejudice for lack of personal jurisdiction and terminates \nthis case.  \n \nDated: March 16, 2021  ______________________ \n SARA L.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of *In re Google Assistant Privacy Litigation*, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted non-party Appen Butler Hill Inc.'s motion to file certain documents under seal. These documents included a Statement of Work and related submissions containing proprietary and competitively sensitive information about Appen's services and pricing offered to Google. This case involves AI since Appen provides tools and services to enhance Google's artificial intelligence products, which were considered sensitive and non-public business information.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the motion to seal documents containing confidential business and financial information should be granted given that the documents are only tangentially related to the merits of the case.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The Court granted Appen's motion to seal the documents, finding that there was \"good cause\" to keep the information confidential due to its proprietary nature and the competitive sensitivity of the content.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you've made a secret recipe for a kind of ice cream that no one else knows how to make, and it's the reason why people love your ice cream shop.

The judge decides it's okay to keep your recipe a secret because showing it could help others copy your business.

See Motion, ECF No. 237.   Appen seeks \nto seal in its entirety a July 1, 2016 Statement of  Work ( “Statement of Work ”) between Appen  and \nDefendants Google LLC and Alphabet, Inc. (collectivel y, “Google”).  Further, Appen se eks to seal \nportions of its Motion for R elief that quote from or summarize the Statement of Work.   No \nopposition to Appen ’s sealing motion has been filed.  \nBased on the below reasoning, the Court GRANTS the parties’ sealing motions.  \nI. LEGAL STANDARD  \n“Historically, courts have recognized a ‘general right to inspect and copy public records and \ndocuments, including judicial records and documents.’”  Kamakana v. C ity and Cnty. of Honolulu , \n447 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Nixon v. Warner Commc’ns, Inc. , 435 U.S. 589, \n597 & n.7 (1978)). Consequently, access to motions and their attachments that are “more than \ntangentially related to the merits of a case”  may be sealed only upon a showing of “compelling \nreasons” for sealing.  Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Chrysler Grp., LLC , 809 F.3d 1092, 1101 –102 (9th Cir. \n2016).  Filings that are only tangentially related to the merits may be sealed upon a lesser showing Case 5:19-cv-04286-BLF     Document 252     Filed 08/26/22     Page 1 of 3 \n2 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  of “good cause.”  Id. at 1097.  \nIn addition, in this district, all parties requesting sealing must comply with Civil Local \nRule  79-5.  That rule requires, inter alia, the moving party to provide “the reasons for keeping a \ndocument under seal, including an expl anation of: (i) the legitimate private or public interests that \nwarrant sealing; (ii) the injury that will result if sealing is denied; and (iii) why a less restrictive \nalternative to sealing is not sufficient.”  Civ. L.R. 79 -5(c)(1)(i).  Further, Civil Lo cal Rule 79 -5 \nrequires the moving party to provide “evidentiary support from declarations where necessary.”  \nCiv. L.R. 79-5(c)(1)(ii).  \nII. DISCUSSION  \nAppen ’s sealing mot ion pertains to filings related to non-party Appen ’s Motion for Relief .  \nSince that motion is only tangentially related  to the merits of the claims in  the above -captioned \nlawsuit , the filings at issue may be sealed upon a showing of “good cause. ”  See Ctr. for Auto Safety , \n809 F.3d at  1097.  \nAppen seeks to have  the Statement of Work and related portions of Motion for R elief sealed \nbecause they contain “extensive detail regarding Appen ’s proprietary tools and customized services \nperfo rmed for Google ” and “detailed pricing information regarding the services that Appen provided  \nto Google. ”  See Sealing Motion, ECF No. 237 at  2.  Appen provides a declaration from Director of \nClient Services Birkir Larusson indicati ng that such information  is “non-public and competitively \nsensitive ” to Appen, because it would give insight into Appen ’s “proprietary tools and cu stomized \nworkflo ws” as well as it s “price point ” in the “fierce ” new industry space of “providing tools to help \nclients improve their artificial intelligence products. ”  See Larusson Decl., ECF No. 237 -1 ¶ 3.  The \nCourt finds that Appen has met the  “good cause ” standard for sealing the information at issue.  See, \ne.g., In re Electronic Arts , 298  Fed.Appx.  568, 569 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding compelling reasons for \nsealing “ pricing terms, royalty rates, and guaranteed minimum payment terms ”); Nicolosi \nDistributing, Inc. v. Finishmaster, Inc. , No. 18 –cv–03587 –BLF, 2018  WL 10758114, at  *2 (N.D. \nCal. Aug. 28, 2018) (“[C] ompelling reasons exist [to seal three contracts] because they contain \nproprietary and confidential business information, includi ng potential trade secrets and business \npractices, such as product rates and purchase requirements. ”).  Accordingly, the Court rules as Case 5:19-cv-04286-BLF     Document 252     Filed 08/26/22     Page 2 of 3 \n3 1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  follow s on Appen ’s sealing requests : \n \nECF No.  Document  Portions t o Seal  Ruling  \n237-6 July 1, 2016 Statement \nof Work  between \nAppen and Google  Entirety of document  GRANT ED, as \nconfidential business \nand financial \ninformation  of Appen . \n236 Motion for Relief \nfrom Nondispositive \nPretrial Orde r of \nMagistrate Judge  Highlighted portions \nat: \n• 2:2–2:4 \n• 2:6–2:7 \n• 4:3–4:8 \n• 4:12 \n• 4:18–4:23 \n• 5:7–5:10 GRANT ED, as \nconfidential business \nand financial \ninformation  of Appen . \n \nIII.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: In the case of Melissa Thornley et al. v. Clearview AI, Inc., plaintiffs filed a class-action lawsuit against Clearview AI under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) for profiting from their biometric data without consent. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state court, as the federal court found it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under Article III, because the plaintiffs did not allege a concrete injury-in-fact. The case involves AI as Clearview used an AI-driven facial recognition application to scrape social media images for biometric data.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the plaintiffs had Article III standing due to an alleged injury-in-fact under BIPA when they did not claim any specific personal injury but only statutory damages and attorney’s fees for the sale of biometric information.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Clearview AI failed to establish that the plaintiffs suffered a concrete injury-in-fact required for Article III standing, thus granting the motion to remand the case back to state court where such Article III constraints do not apply.\n\n4. **ELI5 explanation**: The plaintiffs sued Clearview AI because they believe the company illegally made money by creating and using a facial recognition tool that collected their facial data without consent. The court decided they should take this case to a state court instead of federal court because they didn't show they were directly hurt in a way the federal court would recognize.

Before the Court is \nplaintiffs’ motion to remand pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1447(c).  For the reasons stated below, the \nCourt grants plaintiffs’ motion and remands this  lawsuit to the Circuit Court of Cook County. \nBackground  Plaintiffs bring a one-count putative cla ss action complaint under the Illinois Biometric \nInformation Privacy Act, 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. (“BIPA”), a consumer privacy statute.  In their \ncomplaint, plaintiffs allege that Clearview is an artificial intelligence compan y that secretly created a \ndatabase of over three billion facial scans.  Clea rview created a facial recognition application by \nscraping photographs posted on social medi a platforms, among other sources.  \n Unlike plaintiffs in other recent lawsuits against Clearview,\n1 the present plaintiffs do not seek \ndamages based on actual injury for violations of 74 0 ILCS 14/15(b).  Instead, plaintiffs bring their \nlawsuit under 740 ILCS 14/15(c) that provides: “No private entity in possession of a biometric \nidentifier or biometric information may sell, lease,  trade, or otherwise profit from a person’s or a \n \n1 See Mutnick v. Clearview AI, Inc., et al ., 20-cv-0512. Case: 1:20-cv-03843 Document #: 37 Filed: 10/23/20 Page 1 of 4 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n customer’s biometric identifier or biometric inform ation.”  More specifically, Plaintiffs do not base \ntheir lawsuit on Clearview scraping their photog raphs from public sources, converting their \nphotographs into biometric facial scans, and disclo sing biometric facial scans, which would have \nrequired certain disclosures and plaintiffs’ consen t under BIPA § 15(b).  Rather, they are seeking \nonly statutory damages and attorney’s fees for the sale of their biometric information. Discussion  In their motion to remand, plaintiffs argue that the Court does not have subject matter \njurisdiction over their lawsuit based on the lack of Article III standing.  As the proponent of subject \nmatter jurisdiction, Clearview must establish: (1) pl aintiffs suffered an actual or imminent, concrete \nand particularized injury-in-fact; (2) a causal c onnection between the injury and the challenged \nconduct; and (3) the likelihood the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.  Speech First, Inc. v. \nKilleen,  968 F.3d 628, 638 (7th Cir. 2020).  \n Plaintiffs argue that Clearview cannot establis h they suffered an injury-in-fact because “a \nbare procedural violation, divorced from any c oncrete harm,” does not “satisfy the injury-in-fact \nrequirement of Article III.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins , 136 S.Ct. 1540, 1549 (2016).  Plaintiffs point to a \nrecent Seventh Circuit decision discussing BIPA and Article III standing, see Bryant v. Compass Group \nUSA, Inc.,  958 F.3d 617, 621 (7th Cir. 2 020), to support their argument.   \n In Bryant , the Seventh Circuit considered whether the plaintiff had standing to bring claims \nunder §§ 15(a) and 15(b) of BIPA.  In doing so, the Bryant  court first held that the plaintiff had \nalleged sufficient factual details of a concrete, pa rticularized injury-in-fact satisfying Article III \nstanding concerning her § 15(b) claim based on defe ndant’s failure to make the required disclosures \nand failure to obtain plaintiff’s informed written consent before collecting her biometric data.  The \nSeventh Circuit concluded that by failing to comply with these requirements, defendant “inflicted \nthe concrete injury BIPA in tended to protect against, i.e. a consumer’s loss of the power and ability Case: 1:20-cv-03843 Document #: 37 Filed: 10/23/20 Page 2 of 4 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n to make informed decisions about the collection, storage, and use of her biometric information.” Id. \nat 627.  As to plaintiff’s allegations under BIPA § 15(a), namely, that defendant failed to publicize a \ndata-retention policy and guidelines for destroyi ng biometric information, the Seventh Circuit \nconcluded this duty is not owed to the plaintiff, but to the general public.  Id. at 626.  The Bryant  \npanel thus concluded that plaintiff did not suffer a concrete or particularized injury-in-fact under § \n15(a).  Id.   \n With this guidance in mind, the Court’s inquiry is whether the present plaintiffs alleged Clearview’s sale of their biometric information under BIPA § 15(c) caused them a concrete, particularized harm, which is a fact-specific analysis.  See Diedrich v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC , 839 \nF.3d 583, 588 (7th Cir. 2016).  In their compla int, plaintiffs purposely narrowed their claim by \nsetting a class period from January 1, 2016 to Januar y 17, 2020, specifically stating that that the class \nmembers did not suffer any injury under § 15(c) “other than statutory aggrievement.”  Class members are citizens of Illinois and seek only statutory damages and attorney’s fees – not actual damages.  Plaintiffs’ § 15(c) allegations fit under BI PA’s statutory scheme, especially in light of the \nIllinois Supreme Court’s holding that “an individual need not allege some actual injury or adverse \neffect, beyond violation of his or her rights under the Act, in order to qualify as an ‘aggrieved’ person.”  Rosenbach v. Six Flags Enter. Corp., 129 N.E.3d 1197, 1207, 432 Ill. Dec. 654, 664 (Ill. 2019).  \n Despite Clearview’s arguments that plaintiffs  are attempting to manipulate their claims, as \nwith all lawsuits, a plaintiff is the master of her own complaint.  Plaintiffs purposely narrowed their \nclaim to the general prohibition of Clearview selling and profiting from plaintiffs’ biometric data and \nfiled their lawsuit in state court where such actions  are allowed without the constraints of Article III \nstanding .  Protect Our Parks, Inc. v. Chicago Park Dist. , 971 F.3d 722, 731 (7th Cir. 2020) (“Article III \ndoes not apply to the states, so ‘state courts are not bound by the limit ations of a case or Case: 1:20-cv-03843 Document #: 37 Filed: 10/23/20 Page 3 of 4 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n \ncontroversy or other federal rules of  justiciability.’”) (citation omitted).  In the end, plaintiffs did not \nallege an injury-in-fact, and thus Clearview has failed to establish Article III standing. Conclusion  \n Based on the foregoing, the Court grants plaintiffs’ motion to remand to the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Divisi on.  [27]  Civil case terminated. \nIT IS SO ORDERED. \n Date: 10/23/2020        Entered: _____________________________          S H A R O N  J O H N S O N  C O L E M A N           United States District Judge \n   \n  Case: 1:20-cv-03843 Document #: 37 Filed: 10/23/20 Page 4 of 4 PageID #:<pageID>",

The case involves AI in the claims where the plaintiff accuses the defendants of utilizing AI for harassment and identity exploitation.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether the federal court has jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff's claims of civil rights violations given ongoing or decided state court proceedings and the lack of a sufficient claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction based on the Younger and Rooker-Feldman doctrines, as the matters could be or were being addressed in state court, and for failing to comply with a court order to address these jurisdictional issues. Additionally, the court considered imposing filing restrictions on the plaintiff due to repeated improper filings.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: This case is about someone who believed they were being harassed using high-tech methods and filed a lawsuit about it. However, the court said that they should actually be dealing with this at a different court (state court) and thus dismissed the case.

See Order to Show Cause at 3-4, Doc. 5, \nfiled August 7, 2025.  Judge Sweazea ordered Plaintiff to show cau se why the Court should not \ndismiss this case for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Younger  and/or Rooker-Feldman  and for \nfailure to state a claim pur suant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  See Order to Show Cause at 4.  Judge \nSweazea also ordered Plaintiff to file an amended complaint.  See Order to Show Cause at 4 (stating \nPlaintiff must identify e ach case in state court dealing with th e same facts involved in this action \nincluding the name of th e courts and the case numbers and mu st indicate whether the state court \nproceeding is ongoing, has been dismissed and whet her Plaintiff has appealed any final judgment \nin the state cour t proceeding).   \nThe Court dismisses this case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to \ncomply with the Order to Show Cause.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (“If the court determines at \nany time that it lacks subject-mat ter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action”).  Judge \nSweazea notified Plaintiff she bears the burden of alle ging facts that support jurisdiction and that \nfailure to comply with Court Orders may result in sanctions including filing restrictions and \ndismissal of this case.  See Order to Show Cause at 4-5 (quoti ng Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b) (“If the \nplaintiff fails to prosecute or to comply with thes e rules or a court order, a defendant may move to \ndismiss the action”); Gustafson v.

Utah , 775 Fed.Appx. 420, 422 (10th Cir. \n2019). \n Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 2 of 73 \n 1199, 1204 n.3 (10th Cir. 2003))).   Plaintiff did not file a respons e showing cause why the Court \nshould not dismiss this case fo r lack of jurisdiction by the A ugust 28, 2025, deadline.  Although \nPlaintiff timely filed an Amended Complaint, it  does not show why the C ourt should not dismiss \nthis case for lack of jurisdiction due to the proceedings in state c ourt; nor does it identify the state \ncourt case numbers and the disposition of each case.  See Amended Complaint for Violation of \nCivil Rights, Doc. 6, filed Augus t 25, 2025 (alleging Defendants “dep loyed artificial intelligence \ntechnologies to direct continuous verbal a buse, body-focused harassment, and psychological \ntorment at Plaintiff” and “maint ain[ed] a continuous electronic ‘frequency’ connection targeting \nPlaintiff’s body and mind . . .[which] causes phys ical vibration, foul odors, pain, and severe \nemotional distress”).   Plaintiff also filed a Motion for Prelimin ary Emergency Injunction “to prevent further \nirreparable harm pending resolution of the underlying civil rights complaint” and, among other \nthings, “prohibiting Defendant Vera Demchok from continuing frequency-based targeting and \nharassment of Plaintiff.”  Do c. 7, filed August 29, 2025.  The Cour t denies Plaintiff’s Motion for \nPreliminary Emergency Injunction because the C ourt is dismissing this case for lack of \njurisdiction. \nORDER TO SHOW CAUSE \nPlaintiff has filed five cases in this Cour t asserting claims against Defendant Vera \nDemchok.  See Spilsbury v. Demchok , No. 2:25cv00646-KWR-KRS (this case; dismissed for lack \nof jurisdiction and for failure to comply with the Court’s Order to Show Cause); Spilsbury v. \nDemchok , No. 2:24cv01043-DHU-JHR (dismissed for failur e to state a claim and for failure to \ncomply with the Court’s Order to Show Cause); Spilsbury v. Demchok , No. 2:24cv00404-MV-JHR \n(dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to  comply with the Court’s Order to Show Cause); Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 3 of 74 \n Spilsbury v. Demchok , No. 2:24cv00045-MIS-GJF (dismissed for failure to state a claim and for \nfailure to comply with the C ourt’s Order to Show Cause); Spilsbury v. Demchok , No. 2:23cv00917-\nKWR-GBW (dismissed for fail ure to state a claim). \nPlaintiff has repeatedly filed complaints that fa iled to state a claim or failed to show the \nCourt had jurisdiction over her claims and has repeat edly failed to comply with the Court’s Orders \nto Show Cause.  The Court finds that filing restri ctions are appropriate so  that the Court does not \nexpend valuable resources addressing future such filings and orders Plaintiff to show cause why \nthe Court should not impo se filing restrictions. \nCourt’s Power to Impose Filing Restrictions   The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has discussed the Court’s power \nto impose filing restrictions and the pr ocedure for imposing filing restrictions: \n“[T]he right of access to the courts is neither absolute  nor unconditional and there \nis no constitutional right of access to the courts to prosecute an action that is \nfrivolous or malicious.” Tripati v. Beaman,  878 F.2d 351, 353 (10th Cir.1989) (per \ncuriam) (citation omitted). “There is str ong precedent establis hing the inherent \npower of federal courts to regulate the activities of abusive litigants by imposing \ncarefully tailored restrictions unde r the appropriate circumstances.” Cotner v. \nHopkins,  795 F.2d 900, 902 (10th Cir.1986). “E ven onerous conditions may be \nimposed upon a litigant as long as they are de signed to assist the ... court in curbing \nthe particular abusive be havior involved,” except th at they “cannot be so \nburdensome ... as to deny a litigant meaningful access to the courts.” Id. (brackets \nand internal quotation marks omitted). “Litigiousness alone will not support an \ninjunction restricting filing activities. However, injunc tions are proper where the \nlitigant's abusive and lengthy history is properly set forth.” Tripati,  878 F.2d at 353 \n(citations omitted). “[T]here must be some guidelines as to what [a party] must do to obtain the court's permi ssion to file an action.” Id. at 354. “In additi on, [the party] \nis entitled to notice and an  opportunity to oppose the co urt's order before it is \ninstituted.” Id. A hearing is not required; a wr itten opportunity to respond is \nsufficient. See id.  \n \nLandrith v. Schmidt , 732 F.3d 1171, 1174 (10th Cir. 2013).   \nProposed Filing Restrictions  \n The Court proposes to impose the follo wing filing restrictions on Plaintiff: Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 4 of 75 \n  Plaintiff will be enjoined from making further fi lings in this case exce pt objections to this \norder, a notice of appeal and a moti on for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis ; and the \nClerk will be directed to not fi le any additional submissions by Plai ntiff in this case other than \nobjections to this order, a notice of appeal , or a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma \npauperis,  unless a licensed attorney who is admitted to practice before this Court and has appeared \nin this action signs the proposed filing.    Plaintiff also will be enjoin ed from initiating future litigati on in this Court and the Clerk \nwill be directed to not file a ny initial pleading that Plaintiff submits, unless either a licensed \nattorney who is admitted to practice before this Court signs the pleading or Plaintiff first obtains \npermission to proceed pro se .  See DePineda v. Hemphill , 34 F.3d 946, 948-49 (10th Cir. 1994). \nTo obtain permission to proceed pro se  in this Court, Plaintiff must take the following steps: \n1. File with the Clerk of Court a petition requesting leave to file a pro se initial pleading, a \nnotarized affidavit, the proposed initial plea ding, and a copy of thes e filing restrictions; \n2. The affidavit must be notarized, be in proper le gal form and recite the claims that Plaintiff \nseeks to present, including a short discussion of th e legal bases for the claims, and the basis of the \nCourt’s jurisdiction of the subject matter and parties.  The affidavit must certify that, to the best of \nPlaintiff’s knowledge, Plaintiff's claims are not frivolous or made  in bad faith; that they are \nwarranted by existing law or a good faith argument for th e extension, mo dification, or reversal of \nexisting law; that the new suit is not initiated fo r any improper purpose su ch as delay or needless \nincrease in the cost of litigation; and that Plai ntiff will comply with all Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure and the District of New Mexico’s Local Rules of Civil Procedure.  If Plaintiff’s claims \nhave previously been ra ised or Plaintiff has previously sued the defendants, the affidavit must Case 2:25-cv-00646-KWR-KRS     Document 8     Filed 09/15/25     Page 5 of 76 \n certify that the proposed new suit doe s not present the same claims th at this or any other court has \ndecided and explain why the new suit w ould not be an abuse of the system; \n3.  The Clerk of the Court shal l open a new civil case, file th e petition, the affidavit, the \nproposed pleading and the copy of these restricti ons in the new civil cas e, and randomly assign a \nMagistrate Judge to determine whether to  grant Plaintiff’s petition to proceed pro se  in the new \ncivil case.  See Mem. Op. and Order, Doc. 21 at 6-9, filed in In re Billy L. Edwards , No. 15cv631 \nMCA/SMV (D.N.M. November 13, 2015) (adopting procedure, similar to that of the Tenth Circuit, \nof opening a new case and filing the rest ricted filer’s petition to proceed pro se ).  If the Magistrate \nJudge approves Plaintiff’s petition to proceed pro se , the Magistrate Judge shall enter an order \nindicating that the matter shall proceed in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nand the District of New Mexico’s  Local Rules of Civil Procedure.   If the Magistrate Judge does \nnot approve Plaintiff’s petition to proceed pro se , the Magistrate Judge shall instruct the Clerk to \nassign a District Judge to the new case.  \n IT IS ORDERED that: \n(i) This case is DISMISSED without prejudice.  \n(ii) Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Em ergency Injunction, Doc. 7, filed August 29, \n2025, is DENIED.  \n(iii) Within fourteen (14) days from entry of  this Order, Plaintiff shall show cause why \nthis Court should not enter the proposed  filing restrictions described above. \nPlaintiff’s written objections to the proposed  filing restrictions shall be limited to \n10 pages.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: Six Illinois residents filed a class action lawsuit against HireVue, Inc., alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) for capturing their biometric data during job interviews using HireVue's AI-powered software. The court partially granted and partially denied HireVue's motion to dismiss, upholding specific personal jurisdiction and claims under several sections of BIPA, but dismissing claims under § 15(c) that related to profiting from biometric data without adequate allegations of individual harm or direct profit from the data itself.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether HireVue's AI-driven collection and use of biometric data from job applicants violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), and whether the Illinois court has specific personal jurisdiction over HireVue.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that it could exercise specific personal jurisdiction over HireVue because the company purposefully availed itself of the Illinois market by providing its AI software to an Illinois-based company. The motion to dismiss claims for lack of personal jurisdiction was denied, but the motion was granted in part for failure to state a claim under § 15(c) of BIPA regarding profiting from biometric data, while other claims were allowed to proceed.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you used a fancy computer program for a video job interview that analyzed your face to decide if you are a good fit for a job. Some people from Illinois sued the company that made the program, saying it didn't follow the rules for handling personal data like your face geometry during the interview. The court said the case could continue in Illinois because the company allowed its software to be used there, but it threw out one part where there wasn't enough evidence that the company had directly profited from selling anyone's data. So, most of the case can keep going to see if the company broke any data privacy rules.",
    "full_text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS  \nEASTERN DIVISION  \n \n \nKRISTEN DEYERLER, et al. , \nPlaintiff s \n \nv. \n \nHIREVUE, INC. , \nDefendant  \n  \n  \nNo. 22 CV 1284  \n \nJudge Jeremy C. Daniel  \n \nMEMORANDUM ORDER  \nSix Illinois residents1 filed this putative class action alleging that Hire Vue, \nInc. (“HireVue”), a Utah -based software vendor,  violated the Illinois Biometric \nInformation Privacy Act (“BIPA”), 740 ILCS 14/1, et seq. , when its  interactive  \nsoftware captured and collected their biometric information  during virtual job \ninterviews . HireVue now moves to dismiss the plaintiffs’ first amended complaint  \nunder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6) . (R. 48.)  For the reasons \nset forth in this opinion, the motion  is granted  in part and denied in part.  \nBACKGROUND  \nHireVue  is a Delaware corporation based  in Utah  that develops and markets \nsoftware to assess job applicants’ performance during  virtual  interviews. ( FAC \n¶¶ 16, 19.) HireVue sells its software  to employers —including companies \nheadquartered in Illinois —who are looking to fill job openings. ( Id. ¶ 20.) HireVue’s  \nsoftware allows customers to  record video  interview s with potential candidate s and \n \n1 The plaintiffs’ full names are Kristen Deyerler, Max Ellithorpe, Bryen Zimmerman, \nChristopher Coats, Nicolas Galindo, and William Phemister. ( See generally  R. 17 (“FAC”).)  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 1 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>2 \n analyze the ir performance with artificial intelligence . (Id. ¶ 19.) Each recorded \ninterview yields “thousands of data points” that  are used to assess candidates’ \ncognitive ability, personality traits, emotional intelligence, and social aptitude. ( Id. \n¶ 21.)  \nThe plaintiffs are six Illinois residents who allege that HireVue captured and \ncollected  their biometric identifiers when they used HireVue’s platform to interview \nfor positions in Illinois . (See generally id .) The y filed this putative class action alleg ing \nthat HireVue’ s actions violate subsections 15(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the  BIPA . (See \nFAC.)  HireVue now moves to dismiss the first amended complaint  in its entirety \nunder Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) and 12(b)(6).  (R. 48.)  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \n \nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) tests whether a federal court has \npersonal jurisdiction over a defendant. Curry v. Revolution Labs., LLC , 949 F.3d 385, \n392 (7th Cir. 2020). Although a plaintiff need not allege personal jurisdiction in their \ncomplaint, they bear the burden of establishing it once a defendant moves to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(2). Id.  at 392. At the pleading  stage, a plaintiff only needs to \nestablish  a prima facie case for personal jurisdiction to proceed. uBID, Inc. v. \nGoDaddy Grp., I nc., 623 F.3d 421, 423 (7th Cir. 2010). The plaintiff “is entitled to the \nresolution in its favor of all disputes concerning relevant facts presented in the \nrecord.” Purdue Rsch. Found. v . Sanofi -Synthelabo, S.A. , 338 F.3d 773, 782 (7th Cir. \n2003) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The Court may weigh declarations  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 2 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>3 \n submitted by the parties  in evaluating whether the plaintiff has established its prima \nfacie case. Curry , 949 F.3d at 393. \nA Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, “test[s] the \nsufficiency of the complaint, not the merits of the case.” Gociman v. Loyola Univ. of \nChi., 41 F.4th 873, 885 (7th Cir. 2022). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint \nmust “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly , \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads \nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefend ant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal , 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009). The complaint must put the defendants on “fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Twombly , 550 U.S. at 555 (citation omitted).  \nANALYSIS  \n \nI. H\nIREVUE’S RULE 12(B)(2)  MOTION  \nThe Court first addresses Hire Vue’s motion to dismiss for lack of personal \njurisdiction. In a diversity action under Illinois law ,2 personal jurisdiction is \npermitted to the extent allowed  by due process. Bristol Meyers v. Super. Ct. , 137 S. \nCt. 1773, 1779 (2017); Rogers v. City of Hobart , 996 F.3d 812, 818 (7th Cir. 2021). \nFederal law recognizes both general and specific personal jurisdiction. General \npersonal jurisdiction exists over a defendant who has “continuous and systematic” \ncontacts with the forum state and is “essentially at home ” there. Daimler AG v. \nBauman , 571 U.S. 117, 119 (2014). By contrast, specific personal jurisdiction may be \n \n2 The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d) , et seq.   Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 3 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>4 \n exercised  only when (1) the defendant purposefully directs its activities at the forum \nstate or conducts business in that state, and (2) the alleged injury “arise[s] out of or \nrelate[s] to the defendant’s contacts” with the forum. Tamburo v. Dworkin , 601 F.3d \n693, 702 (7th Cir. 2010). In this case, the parties do not dispute that Illinois lacks \ngeneral personal jurisdiction over Hire Vue; the relevant question  is whether the \nCourt may exercise  specific personal jurisdiction over the company . \nIn support of its Rule 12(b)(2) motion, HireVue submitted the unrebutted \ndeclarations of its former Senior Vice President of Product, Richard Simmons, and its \nChief Financial Officer, Kevin Coombs. (See R. 57 -1 (“Simmons Decl.”); R. 57 -2 \n(“Coombs Decl.”). )  \nThe Simmons d eclaration provides an overview of HireVue’s software platform  \nand its relationship to  the plaintiffs’  individual allegations . (See generally  Simmons \nDecl.) Simmons states that HireVue provides its customers  with an “out -of-the-box” \ninterview platform, which employers  can customize and configure to fit their needs. \n(Simmons Decl. ¶  6.) Interview applicants’ data are collected and analyzed with  \n“HireVue Assessments,” an “optional add- on component” to HireVue’s  basic software \npackage . (Simmons Decl. ¶¶  9–16.) Simmons  states that most of HireVue’s customers \ndo not use the HireVue Assessments technol ogy and  represents  that only one of the \nplaintiffs —Max Ellithorpe —was interviewed using  this technology . (Id. ¶¶ 16, 29) \nSimmons also state s that HireVue Asse ssments  was not developed in Illinois and no \nteam in Illinois was involved  in its creation . (Id. ¶ 18.)  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 4 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>5 \n The Coombs declaration provides an overview of HireVue’s corporate \noperations and presence in Illinois. ( See generally Coombs Decl.) Coombs states that \nHireVue has no meaningful corporate presence in Illinois and does not market its \ntechnology to individual residents of the state . (Coombs Decl. ¶¶  4–5, 8.) He states \nthat HireVue does not  control over where its customers deploy its software. ( Id. ¶ 9.) \nCoombs concedes, however,  that HireVue employs eight individuals who reside in \nIllinois . (Id. ¶ 11.) He  further states that HireVue is party to a service agreement \nwith Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois, one of the “operating divisions” of Health \nCare Service Corporation  (“HCSC”), the company that Ellithorpe interviewed with.  \n(Id. ¶¶ 13–16.) In its briefing, HireVue admits that HCSC is headquartered in \nChicago, Illinois. (R. 49 at 12.)  \nAccepting the information in the declarations as true, the  Court finds that the \nplaintiffs have met their burden of establishing a prima facie case for exercising  \nspecific personal jurisdiction.  The plaintiffs have alleged —and HireVue does not \ndispute —that HireVue intentionally caused its biometric software to be marketed \nand sold to at least one company headquartered  in Illinois and that this software was \nused to capture at least one of the plaintiff’s biometric identifiers.  (See generally \nFAC.)  These facts are sufficient to establish that Hire Vue “purposefully a vailed itself \nof the Illinois market.” GoDaddy , 623 F.3d at 429. In the retail context, the  Seventh \nCircuit has held that a single  online  sale of a  tangible product to a customer in Illinois \nis sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over a retailer. NBA Props. , Inc. v. \nHANWJH , 46 F.4th 614, 624 (7th Cir. 2022), cert. denied , 143 S. Ct. 577 (2023). It Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 5 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>6 \n follows that a sale of a n interactive  software product to a single customer in Illinois  \nthat is used by the customer to capture Illinois residents’ biometric data  may be \nsufficient to establish specific personal jurisdiction as well.  See King v. PeopleNet \nCorp., 21 C 2774, 2021 WL 5006692, at  *6 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 28, 2021) ( finding  that a \nthird- party software vendor’s  contracts  with Illinois -based companies who mandated \nthat their staff use its biometric technology were sufficient to establish minimum \ncontacts).  \nHireVue cites several cases for the proposition a third party’s contacts with a \nforum state may not be imputed to a n out -of-state technology vendor  simply because \nthe vendor  and the third party contract ed with each other. (See R. 49 at 13 (citing \nSalkauskaite v. Sephora USA, Inc. , No. 18 C 8507, 2020 WL 2796122 (N.D. Ill. May \n30, 2020); Bray v. Lathem Time Co. , No. 19  C 3157, 2020 WL 1492742 (C.D. Ill. Mar. \n27, 2020)); R. 50 (citing Redd v. Amazon Web Servs., Inc. , 22 C 6779, 2023 WL \n3505264, at *3 (N.D. Il l. May 17, 2023) ).) HireVue argues that the plaintiffs similarly \nattempt to impute HCSC’s contacts with Illinois to HireVue,  even though it  had no \nintention of targeting the forum state .  \nAs the plaintiffs point out,  however,  the cases that HireVue  cites  are \ndistinguishable because they involved allegations that the technology  at issue was \ndeployed  in the forum state without the defendants’ knowledge.  (See R. 51 at 13.) Here, \nHireVue admits that it knowingly executed a service  agreement with an Illinois \nheadquartered company, and that company used HireVue’s artificial intelligence \nsoftware to interview one of the plaintiffs in Illinois. (Coombs Decl. ¶  16; Simmons Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 6 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>7 \n Decl. ¶  29.) These allegations are sufficient to establish that HireVue “purposefully \ndirected” activity at Illinois. Tamburo , 601 F.3d at 702; see also Redd, 2023 WL \n3505264 at *3 ( “It is possible for a defendant to establish the requisite contacts via a \nthird party so long as the defendant itself targets the forum.” ). \nHireVue  also suggests that, because Ellithorpe  is the only plaintiff who was \ninterviewed by an Illinois -based company , the other plaintiffs cannot establish \npersonal jurisdiction . (R. 49 at 12 (“ Because Ellithorpe is the sole Plaintiff who \ninteracted with the relevant technology, he is the only one who could, in theory, \nestablish personal jurisdiction.”).)  While the personal jurisdiction analysis is \n“plaintiff -specific,” Arnold  v. Goldstar Fin. Sys.,  Inc., No. 01 C 7694, 2002 WL \n1941546, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Au g. 22, 2002)  (Phillips  Exeter Acad.  v. Howard  Phillips  \nFund,  Inc., 196 F.3d 284, 289 (1st Cir.1999)), “ a strict causal relationship between \nthe defendant ’s in-state activity and the litigation” is not required . Ford Motor Co. v. \nMont . Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct. , 141 S. Ct. 1017, 1026 (2021). Instead , to establish \npersonal jurisdiction for each of the plaintiffs’ claims,  the claims need only “arise out \nof or relate to  the defendant’s contacts with the forum.”  Id. (emphasis added).  \nAlthough “not just any relationship will suffi ce,” due process is satisfied when there \nis a sufficiently close nexus between “the defendant, the forum[s], and the litigation.” \nDzananovic v. Bumble, Inc. , 21 C 6925, 2023 WL 4405833, at *5 (N.D. Ill. July 7, \n2023) (quoting NBA Props., 46 F.4th at 626 n.18). \nHere, all six of the plaintiffs allege that they interviewed for positions in \nIllinois  using a software that HireVue  marketed and sold to at least one company  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 7 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>8 \n headquartered in Illinois . (See generally  FAC.) Moreover, they each allege that they \nwere physically located in Illinois when they interacted with HireVue’s online \nsoftware platform . (See generally  id.) These allegations are sufficient  to establish \nadequate connections between HireVue and the forum state as to each of the \nplaintiffs’ claims . \nIn sum, the Court concludes that the plaintiffs have met their burden of \nmaking  “a threshold showing of minimum contacts”  with Illinois . Curry , 949 F.3d at \n402 (citation omitted). To rebut this prima facie showing, Hirevue  must present \ncompelling reasons why haling it into court here offends traditional notions of fair \nplay and substantial justice.  Id. Hire Vue has not pointed to any reason why litigating \nits claims in Illinois would be unreasonable or unfair.  (See generally R. 49.)  \nAccordingly, the Court concludes that  it may exercise  specific personal jurisdiction \nover HireVue and denies the defendant’s Rule 12(b)(2)  motion.  \nII. HIREVUE’S RULE 12(B)(6)  MOTION  \nThe Court next turns to Hire Vue’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion . Unlike a motion to \ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion  is limited in scope to \nthe sufficiency of the allegations set forth in the complaint. Geinosky v. City of Chi. , \n675 F.3d 743, 745 n.1 (7th Cir. 2012). This means that while the Simmons and \nCoombs declaration s were  properly considered in the context of HireVue’s  Rule \n12(b)(2) motion, they are inappropriate to consider in ruling on its Rule 12(b)(6) motion.  Burlingham v.  U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs. , No. 22  C 1134, 2023 WL \n6390798, at *4 (E.D. Wis. Sept. 30, 2023)  (ignoring declaration submitted in support \nof Rule 12(b)(2) motion in deciding parallel  Rule 12(b)(6) motion); JT’s Frames, Inc. Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 8 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>9 \n v. Casares, 16  C 2504, 2018 WL 835225, at *6 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 13, 2018)  (same). The \nCourt therefore ignores the factual contentions set forth in the Simmons and Coombs \ndeclarations  and considers only the allegations in the first amended complaint  in \ndeciding HireVue’s 12(b)(6) motion.  \nHireVue raises several arguments in support of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6). \nFirst, it argues that  the plaintiffs’ allegations constitute an extraterritorial \napplication of the BIPA.  (R. 49 at 14– 15.) Second, it argues that, under principles of \nstatutory interpretation, the plaintiffs’ claims fall outside of the scope of the statute, \nare foreclosed  by other legislative enactments , or are subject to exemptions . (Id. at \n15–24.) Finally, it argues that the allegations fail to state a claim.  (Id. at 24 –27.) The \nCourt addresses each argument in turn. Because many of HireVue’s arguments are \nfact-specific, the Court declines to decide their merits  prior to summary judgment.  \nA. Extraterritoriality  \nFirst, Hire Vue argues that the plaintiffs’ BIPA claims violate Illinois’ \nextraterritoriality doctrine.  (R. 49 at 14– 15.) Under this doctrine, a statute that does \nnot clearly contemplate extraterritorial effect cannot be applied unless “the circumstances that relate to the disputed transaction occur primarily and \nsubstantially in Illinois.” Avery v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 835 N.E.2d 801, \n854 (Ill. 2005). Courts have recognized that , in the context of BIPA claims, \nextraterritoriality  “is a highly fact -based analysis that is generally inappropriate for \nthe motion to dismiss stage.” Vance v. Int’l Bus. Mach.  Corp. , No. 20 C 577, 2020 WL \n5530134, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 15, 2020)  (collecting cases) .  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 9 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>10 \n Hire Vue cites Neals v. PAR Tech nology Corp oration , in which the district court \ndismissed the plaintiff ’s BIPA claims  because she  did not allege whether she was in \nIllinois when the defendant  scanned her fingerprints. 419 F. Supp. 3d 1088, 1091 \n(N.D. Ill. 2019). Here, by contrast, the plaintiffs allege that they accessed Hire Vue’s \ninterview platform while they were in Illinois  through the use of a webcam . (See FAC \n¶¶ 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 57.)  While Hire Vue disputes the veracity of these allegations \nand repres ents that any biometric data  collected  was stored outside of  Illinois , at this \nstage  the Court is bound to draw all factual inferences in the plaintiffs’ favor. \nVesuvius USA Corp. v. Am. Com. Lines LLC , 910 F.3d 331, 333 (7th Cir. 2018). The \nCourt declines to rule on Hire Vue’s extraterritoriality arguments until a  record has \nbeen developed.  Accordingly, the Court denies its Rule 12(b)(6) motion on this basis.  \nB. Statutory Interpretation Arguments  \nNext, HireVue raises several statutory  interpretation  arguments, arguing that  \nthe plaintiffs’ claims are either not covered by the BIPA , are foreclosed  by other \nlegislation , or are subject to exemptions .  \nFirst, HireVue  argues  that the plaintiffs have failed to allege that their facial \nscans are “biometric identifiers” under the  BIPA. This argument is undermined  by \nthe plain language of the BIPA,  however,  which defines “biometric identifiers” to \ninclude, among other things,  “face geometry.” 740 ILCS 14/10. The first amended \ncomplaint  allege s that HireVue used “facial expression and screening technology . . . \nto identify and assess candidates by collecting their facial geometry.” (FAC ¶  22.) \nThese allegations  are all that is needed at the pleading stage. See Wilk v. Brainshark, \nInc., 21 C 4794, 2022 WL 4482842, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 27, 2022) (denying motion to Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 10 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>11 \n dismiss BIPA claims based on the statutory definition of “biometric identifiers” where \nplaintiff alleged that facial features in sales professionals’ videos were analyzed and \ncollected through facial -mapping technology).  \nSecond, HireVue  argues that the plaintiffs’ BIPA claims are precluded by \nIllinois’ Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act (“AIVIA”) , 820 ILCS 42/1 et seq. \nHireVue appeals to the principle that  “where  two statutes  appear to be in conflict , \nthe more  specific controls  over the more  general .” State v. Mikusch , 562 N.E.2d 168, \n173 ( Ill. 1990). Because the AIVIA specifically regulates the  use of artificial \nintelligence to analyze videos  submitted by job applicants , HireVue argues that the \nplaintiffs  may not bring claims under the BIPA related to HireVue’s use of its online \nvideo platform .  \nThe problem with HireVue’s argument is that it  assumes that the BIPA and \nthe AIVIA impose conflicting —as opposed to concurrent —obligations. In interpreting \nstatutes , the  Court must presume that the Illinois legislature “acts rationally and \nwith full knowledge of all previous enactments” and that “the legislature will not enact a law which completely contradicts a prior statute without an express repeal of \nit.” Mikusch , 562 N.E.2d at 170. As the plaintiffs point out, nothing in the AIVIA \nindicates that the legislature intended to repeal or preempt any portion of  the BIPA \nwhen it enacted the statute , or that the legislature intended to limit  the BIPA’s \nprivate right of actio n. (R. 51 at 15– 17.) Although HireVue points to the fact that the \ntwo statutes impose different consent, retention, and disclosure obligations, these \napparent conflicts do not compel the conclusion that the statutes are entirely Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 11 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>12 \n inconsistent with one another  or that the AIVIA forecloses  the plaintiffs’ BIPA claims . \nSee Mikusch , 562 N.E.2d at 173.  Accordingly, the Court denies  HireVue’s motion to \ndismiss on this basis.  \nIn yet another  flourish of  statutory interpretation, HireVue suggests  that the \nBIPA’s “financial institution” exemption bars the plaintiffs’ claims.  (R. 49 at 21–24.) \nSection 25(c) of the BIPA provides that the statute does not apply “in any manner to \na financial institution or an affiliate of a financial institution that is subject to Title  V \nof the federal Gramm -Leach -Bliley Act (‘GLBA’).” 740 ILCS 14/25.  \nCourts in this district have commented that the financial institution exemption \nis akin to an affirmative defense, which cannot be considered in the context of a Rule \n12(b)(6) motion unless the defendant’s entitlement to the defense is apparent from \nthe fa ce of the complaint. See Davis v. Jumio Corp. , No. 2 2 C 776, 2023 WL 2019048, \nat *2 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 14, 2023); Patterson v. Respondus, Inc., 593 F. Supp. 3d 783, 819 n.18 (N.D. Ill. 2022)) (citing United States v. Lewis, 411 F.3d 838, 842 (7th Cir. 2005)).  \nThe first amended complaint contains no allegations  upon which the Court can \ninfer  that HireVue is a financial institution subject to the GBLA. To the contrary , \nHireVue ’s defense rests on the apparently novel and fact -specific assertion that  \nHireVue ’s contracts with health insurance companies  like HCSC  entitle it to the \nfinancial institution exemption . (See R. 47 at 23 (“[T]he practical effect of applying \nthe BIPA to HireVue would be to apply the BIPA to HCSC, which is precisely what § 25(c) forbids.”).) It would be premature to resolve such a fact -specific argument it at \nthis stage.  See Davis, 2023 WL 2019048, at *4 (holding that whether cryptocurrency Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 12 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>13 \n exchange qualified as a financial institution for purposes of BIPA’s financial \ninstitution exemption “presents a question of fact that cannot be determined based \non the allegations of the [c]omplaint”).  Accordingly, the Court declines to consider \nthe merits of this argument and  denies HireVue’s motion to dismiss on this basis.  \nC. Failure to State a Claim  \nFinally, the Court arrives at the question of whether the plaintiffs’ allegations \nare sufficient to state claims under the BIPA.  The plaintiffs allege violations under \nsubsections 15(a), (b), (c), and (d) of the BIPA.  Because each of these subsections gives \nrise to a separate claim, see, e.g. , Clark v. Microsoft Corp. , No. 23 C 695, 2023 WL \n5348760, at *4 (N.D. Ill. Aug. 21, 2023), the Court addresses each in turn.  \nFirst, HireVue argues that the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under \n§ 15(a) of  the BIPA , which requires entities who are “in possession” of biometric \ninformation to “develop a written policy, made available to the public, establishing a \nretention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric identifiers.” \n740 ILCS 14/15(a). Because  the plaintiffs  have  allege d that HireVue “ collect [ed], \ncapture [d] and use [d]” their facial geometry and “did not make publicly available any \nbiometric ret ention policy that disclosed how long it stored the biometrics it collected ,” \n(FAC ¶¶  5, 22, 25) , their  allegations are sufficient to state a claim under § 15(a). See \nRogers v. CSX  Intermodal  Terminals,  Inc., 409 F. Supp. 3d 612, 618 (N.D. Ill. 2019) \n(holding that allegations that the defendant “failed to make publicly available any \nretention or destruction policies”  despite collection of the plaintiff’s biometric data  \nwere sufficient to state a claim under § 15(a)).  Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 13 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>14 \n HireVue argues that the plaintiffs have not alleged that it was “in possession” \nof their biometric  data. (R. 49 at 25.)  The BIPA does not define this term,  however . \nSee 740 ILCS 14/ 10. Given the ordinary meaning of “in possession ,” the first amended \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that HireVue violated  § 15(a)  by capturing and collecting \nthe plaintiffs’ biometric data . See People v. Grant , 52 N.E.3d 308, 313 (Ill. 2016)  \n(“[The] most reliable indicator of [the legislature’s]  intent is the statutory language \nitself, given its plain and ordinary meaning”) ; see also Possession , Black ’s Law \nDictionary (11th ed. 2019) . Accordingly, the Court denies HireVue’s motion to dismiss \non this basis.  \nSimilar ly, HireVue  argues that it is not subject to §  15(b) of BIPA  which \nprohibits, among other things, “captur[ing] [and] collect[ing]” an individual’s \nbiometric information without their consent.  740 ILCS 14/15 (b). HireVue  argues that \nthe plaintiffs cannot state a claim under this subsection because the company does \nnot collect or store  biometric data.  (R. 49 at 25– 26.) But the first amended complaint  \nalleges the opposite: that HireVue actively gathered the plaintiffs’ biometric data \nthrough its software platform . (See FAC ¶¶ 22, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49, 55, 73.)  The Court \nis bound to accept these allegations as true  and draw all inferences in the plaintiffs’ \nfavor. Vesuvius, 910 F.3d at 333. The Court denies HireVue’s motion to dismiss on \nthis basis as well.  \nNext, HireVue moves to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claims under § 15(c) , which  \nprohibits  a company from “sell[ing], leas[ing], trad[ing], or otherwise profit[ing]” from \nan individual’s biometric data.  740 ILCS 14/15(c).  In the context of § 15(c), the Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 14 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>15 \n Seventh Circuit has held that pleading a “bare violation” of the statute is not enough; \ninstead, plaintiffs must allege how th e alleged  conduct harmed them individually. \nThornley  v. Clearview  AI, Inc., 984 F.3d 1241,  1246 –47 (7th Cir. 2021) .  \nHere, the Court agrees with HireVue that the plaintiffs’ allegations fail to state \na claim. The plaintiffs allege that HireVue  profited from their biometric information \nbecause its clients paid for use of its software.  (FAC ¶  26.) But the  fact that HireVue \nprofited from the sale of  its software does not plausibly indicate that it sold, leased, \ntraded, or otherwise profited from the  plaintiffs’  biometric data itself. Moreover, the \nallegations in the first amended complaint plead a “bare violation” of the statute without an explanation of how the plaintiffs have been harmed. Thornley , 984 F.3d \nat 1246– 47. Because the first amended c omplaint does not allege that  HireVue \nprofited directly from the collection of biometric data or explain how the plaintiffs \nwere individually harmed  by this activity , the Court grants HireVue’s motion to \ndismiss as to this claim.  \nFinally, HireVue argues that the plaintiffs’ § 15(d) claim fails because the first \namended complaint does not plausibly allege  that HireVue “disclose[d], redisclose[d], \nor otherwise disseminate[d]” their data. 740 ILCS  14/15(d). But the first amended \ncomplaint  alleges that HireVue’s software “also results in the dissemination of \nbiometrics to third parties, such as data storage vendors.” (FAC ¶  5.) Whether or not \nthis allegation is true, it must be accepted as such at this stage. Vesuvius, 910 F.3d \nat 333.  And allegations that HireVue “disseminated [the plaintiffs’] biometric data to \nother firms that hosted the information in their data centers” are sufficient to state a Case: 1:22-cv-01284 Document #: 56 Filed: 02/26/24 Page 15 of 16 PageID #:<pageID>16 \n \nclaim under § 15(d). Figueroa v. Kronos Inc. , 454 F. Supp. 3d 772, 785 (N.D. Ill. 2020). \nThe Court therefore denies HireVue’s motion to dismiss on this basis.  \nCONCLUSION  \n \nFor the reasons set forth in this memorandum opinion,  the Court grants \nDefendant HireVue  Inc.’s motion to dismiss  in part and denies it in part.  The Court \ndenies HireVue’s Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfinds that it may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over HireVue  with respect to \nall pending claims . The Court  also grants HireVue’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion as to the  \nplaintiffs’ claims under §  15(c) of the BIPA . The motion is denied  as to all other \nclaims. HireVue will have 21 days  to answer the complaint. It is so ordered.  \n \n Date: 2/26/2024             \n        JEREMY C.

    "summary": "1. **Summary**: This court case involves a trademark dispute between Michael Zaletel, operating under i4software, and Prisma Labs, Inc. Zaletel alleged that Prisma Labs' use of the name \"Prisma\" for their AI-driven app infringed upon his trademark \"Prizmia.\" The court denied Zaletel's motion for a preliminary injunction, finding insufficient likelihood of confusion between the two marks and a failure to demonstrate potential irreparable harm. The case is notable for its discussion on AI, as Prisma Labs' app utilizes artificial intelligence to transform photos into artwork.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue**: Whether Prisma Labs' use of the \"Prisma\" mark constitutes trademark infringement, specifically reverse confusion, against the registered \"Prizmia\" trademark held by Michael Zaletel.\n\n3. **Court's Holding**: The court held that Zaletel had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of his trademark infringement claim or that he was likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a preliminary injunction. Consequently, the motion for preliminary injunction was denied.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation**: Imagine you made a special photo app called \"Prizmia\" and someone else made a super popular app called \"Prisma.\" You said their app name was too close to yours, so people might get confused. You asked the court to make them stop, but the court said, \"Nope, people probably won't get confused, and we don’t think you're really losing anything from it.\" Plus, their app is different because it uses smart computer stuff to change photos into art. So, you have to let them keep using their name.",

Background. Plaintiff Michael Zaletel, d/b/a i4software (\"plaintiff'), is a \nsoftware developer in North Carolina who operates i4s0ftware as a sole proprietorship \nto develop and market apps for use in the smart phone market. (D.I. 71 at ,.m 2, 4) \nSince 2009, plaintiff has developed over 40 apps for use on Apple iPhones and other \ndevices; at least three have been commercial hits, each generating sales of more than \n$750,000. (Id. at ,.m 6-10; ex. 1) In August 2014, plaintiff launched his \"Prizmia\" app on \nthe Apple App Store; according to plaintiff, the term \"Prizmia\" was coined for trademark \nuse. (Id. at ,.m 11-14) When the \"Prizmia\" app was introduced in 2014, it cost \nconsumers $4.99, a price that was later increased to $7.99. Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 1 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>2. According to plaintiff, he invested 4,900 hours of programmer time valued at \n$367,500 in developing the \"Prizmia\" app. (Id. at 1119) Plaintiff thereafter engaged in \nvarious promotional activities for his app, including marketing and creating a website \n(www.prizmia.com) (Id. at 111120-25; exs. 3-5) Plaintiff asserts that, since August 2014, \nthe \"Prizmia\" app has been downloaded between 15,000 and 20,000 times by \ncustomers, \"most \nof whom paid for it.\" (Id. at 11 51) \n3. Plaintiff is the owner of the federally registered trademark Prizmia®, 1 Reg. No. \n4,682,035, which was registered on the Principal Register by the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark \nOffice (\"PTO\") on February 3, 2015. (Id., ex. 2) According to the PTO's \nrecords, the mark was first used commercially on June 10, 2014 for \" downloadable \nsoftware for use with mobile electronic devices for the purpose of photo and video \ncapturing and editing; downloadable software in the nature of a mobile application for \nphoto and video capturing and editing, in class 9 (U.S. C. 21, 23, 26, 36 and 38).\" (Id.)) \n4. Although plaintiff now describes the \"Prizmia® \" app as \"allow[ing] users to \nmodify photographs or videos with filters that alter the photo's style or add an artistic \neffect\" (D.I. 67 at 3; D.I. 71at1113 ; exs. 3-4), there can be no dispute that plaintiff \nlaunched the \"Prizmia\" app as \"[a]n innovative , feature-loaded app that seamlessly \nconnects to your GoPro\" camera. Indeed, the app was marketed (including on \nplaintiff's Facebook page and promotional YouTube videos) as \"Prizmia for GoPro.\" \n(D.I. 71, ex. 5; D.I. 75, exs. 12-15) More specifically , plaintiff's original webpage from \nAugust 20, 2014 described his commercial product as \"Prizmia for \nGoPro -The Video \n1The court will use the designation \"Prizmia® \" if the document to which the court \nrefers uses that \ndesignation , or when it is otherwise appropriate to do so. \n2 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 2 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>Filters, Photo Effects, Slow Motion, Live Preview and 4K Sharing App for your Go Pro \nCamera.\" (D.I. 75, ex. 13 at 8/8) The marketing material used at its \"worldwide\" launch \ntouted the \"Prizmia\" app as a \"filmmaking app for \nGoPro filmmakers,\" with the most \n\"distinguishing feature\" being \"its full-screen, real-time preview, which can be seen \ndirectly on [an] iPhone, iPad or iPad Touch while filming with \"[a]dditional features\" such \nas \"more than 40 included professional filters and effects, independent color grading \ncontrols for contrast, saturation, gamma and brightness , optical slow motion speed \nadjustment, live filters preview, Direct GoPro media library access and full control over \nall GoPro settings and features.\" (D.I. 71, ex. 5) According to the marketing piece, \nplaintiff claimed that his \"latest achievement , Prizmia for \nGoPro, has been in stealth \ndevelopment for over 18 months with the singular goal of becoming the very best \naccessory for GoPro cameras. \" (Id.) Plaintiff adopted the following logo for his app \nicon in the Apple App Store: \n(f) \nPr1zm1c • •• \n(D.I. 75, ex. 13 at 8/8) \n5. On May 13, 2016, plaintiff pulled the \"Prizmia for GoPro\" app from the Apple \nApp Store due to a complaint from GoPro, which had sent notice to Apple asserting that \nthe \"Prizmia for \nGoPro\" app was infringing GoPro's copyright, trademark and app name. \n(D.I. 78, ex. 19) Plaintiff rebranded the name of his app from \"Prizmia for GoPro\" to \n\"Prizmia,\" and put a new version of the \"Prizmia\" app on the Apple App Store on July \n3 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 3 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>25, 2016. (D.I. 78at1135; ex. 30) The \"Prizmia for GoPro\" app was only downloaded \n47 times in April 2016, and 23 times in May 2016. (D.I. 75at1120) As indicated above, \nthe \"Prizmia\" app was withdrawn from the Apple App Store from May 13 to July 25, \n2016. (D.I. a~1131-36; exs. 26-30; D.I. 74, exs. 2-3) There is no evidence of record \nthat plaintiff's product has ever been a commercial success. \n6. On or about June 11, 2016, defendant Prisma Labs, Inc. (\"defendant\") \nreleased an app on Apple's App Store and later on the Google Play Store for Android \ndevices. The record indicates that defendant was started about a year before the \nPrisma app launched for the purpose of using \"neural networks and artificial intelligence \nto turn a user's photographs into works of art by taking the user's photo and performing \nimage processing to creating a new stylized image that resembles a particular style of \nart.\" (D.I. 74at11112-6) Defendant markets its product as software that uses artificial \nintelligence to \"transform[] your photos and videos into works of art using the styles of \nfamous artists: Van Gogh, Picasso, Levitan, as well as world famous ornaments and \npatterns.\" (Id., ex. 1) Defendant choose the following logo for its app: \n(D.I. 72 at 6) According to defendant , the word \"prisma\" means \"prism\" in Russian. (Id. \nat 11 9) Defendant chose the domain name \"prisma-ai.com \" for its web domain because \nits \"technology uses artificial intelligence to generate modified images.\" (Id. at 1112; ex. \n1) Defendant conducted a trademark search before finalizing the name \"Prisma,\" which \nsearch (according to defendant) did not turn up the \"Prizmia®\" mark. (Id. at 111110-11) \n4 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 4 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>7. Defendant's app has been very successful. In the first two weeks of its \nrelease, it was downloaded about 2 million times. Since then, it has been downloaded \nover 70 million times across the world and over 8 million times in the United States. (Id. \nat 1l1l 17-18) The \"Prisma\" app has been named \"2016 App of the Year\" by both Apple \nand Google Play, and has received substantial praise and publicity from other sources \nas well. (Id. at1l1l 19-21; D.I. 71, exs. 9-13) \n8. On August 31, 2016, after launching a revised \"Prizmia®\" app, plaintiff sent \ndefendant a cease and desist letter; plaintiff initiated the instant lawsuit on September \n29, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (\"EDVA\"). \nPlaintiff filed his motion for a preliminary injunction on November 22, 2016. (D.I. 17) \nFinding that it lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant , EDVA transferred the case to \nthe District of Delaware on or about December 27, 2016. Plaintiff renewed his motion \nfor a preliminary injunction on January 20, 2016. (D.I. 66) Briefing (along with the \nsubmission of various declarations) is complete , and oral argument has been heard. \n9. The parties do not dispute personal jurisdiction , as defendant is a Delaware \ncorporation . The court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1338(a). \nAlthough plaintiff includes in his complaint allegations of unfair competition, in violation \nof 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a), the focus of the preliminary injunction motion is trademark \ninfringement. \n10. Standard of review. As explained by the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Third Circuit, \n[p]reliminary injunctive relief is an \"extraordinary remedy, which should be \ngranted only in limited circumstances .\" ... \"A plaintiff seeking a preliminary \ninjunction must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that he is \n5 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 5 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that \nthe balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public \ninterest.\" ... The \"failure to establish any element ... renders a preliminary \ninjunction inappropriate.\" ... The movant bears the burden of showing that \nthese four factors weigh in favor of granting the injunction . \nFerring Pharms., Inc. v. Watson Pharmaceuticals , Inc., 765 F.3d 205, 210 (3d Cir. \n2014) (citations omitted). \"[T]he decision whether to grant or deny \ninjunctive relief rests \nwithin the equitable discretion of the district courts, and ... such discretion must be \nexercised consistent with traditional principles of equity.\" eBay Inc. v. MercExchange , \nL.L. C .. 547 U.S. 388, 394 (2006). \n11. Likelihood of success on the merits -trademark infringement. The \nLanham Act defines trademark infringement as use of a mark so similar to that of a \nprior user as to be \"likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\" 15 \nU.S.C. § 1114(1). Plaintiff alleges that he is being damaged under the trademark \ndoctrine of reverse confusion . \"Reverse confusion occurs when a larger, more powerful \ncompany uses the trademark of a smaller, less powerful senior owner and thereby \ncauses likely confusion as to the source of the senior user's goods or services.\" Fisons \nHorticulture , Inc. v. Vigoro Indus., 30 F.3d 466, 474 (3d Cir. 1994). \"Absent reverse \nconfusion, 'a company with a well established trade name and with the economic power \nto advertise extensively [would be immunized from suit] for a product name taken from \na competitor.'\" A & H Sportswear , Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc.,, 237 F.3d 198, \n228 (3d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). Reverse confusion results in the senior user \nlosing the value of its mark, its product and corporate identity, control over its goodwill \nand reputation , and ability to move into new markets. Freedom Card, Inc. v. JP Morgan \n6 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 6 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>Chase & Co., 432 F.3d 463, 471-72 (3d Cir. 2005). According to plaintiff, defendant \n\"has created reverse confusion by distributing its similar app, with a similar name, free \nof charge to 70 million users who might otherwise have purchased [p]laintiff's Prizmia® \napp if not \nfor the infringement.\" (D. I. 67 at 9-10) \n12. Plaintiff has failed to produce any evidence that the doctrine of reverse \nconfusion is applicable to the facts of record. Defendant is a start-up company with one \napp that hit the market in June 2016 without a \"well established trade name\" and with \nno evidence that it had any \"economic power\" other than the strength of its product.2 \nWithout the fundamental premise of the reverse confusion doctrine being proven., that \nis, defendant's status as a \"larger, more powerful company ,\"3 the court declines to take \nthis case out of the traditional analytical framework for trademark cases. \n13. The Third Circuit has adopted the \"Lapp test\" to determine likelihood of \nconfusion in the market. The factors identified in Interpace Corp. v. Lapp, Inc., 721 \nF.2d 460 (3d Cir. 1983) (\"the Lapp factors\" include: \n(1) the degree of similarity between the owner's mark and the alleged \ninfringing mark; (2) the strength of the owner's mark; (3) the price of the \ngoods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected \nof consumers when making a purchase ; (4) the length of time the \ndefendant has used the mark without evidence of actual confusion \narising; (5) the intent of the defendant in adopting the mark; (6) the \nevidence of actual confusion ; (7) whether the goods, [even if] not \ncompeting, are marketed through the same channels of trade and \n2Unlike plaintiff, who had developed and marketed multiple successful apps over \nthe course of years prior to launching his \"Prizmia for GoPro\" app. \n3lndeed, plaintiff asserts (in connection with irreparable harm) that \"there is a \nserious question about [d]efendant's ability to pay any judgment .... Prism has existed \nfor less than a year, gives it app away for free, and has presented no evidence that its \napp has generated any revenue.\" (D.I. 67 at 19) \n7 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 7 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>advertised through the same media; (8) the extent to which the targets \nof the parties' sales efforts are the same; (9) the relationship of the \ngoods in the minds of consumers because of the similarity of function; \n(10) other facts suggesting that the consuming public might expect the \nprior owner to manufacture a product in the defendant's market, or that \nhe is unlikely to expand into that market. \nId. at 463. \"'None of these factors is determinative in the likelihood of confusion \nanalysis and each factor must \nbe weighed and balanced one against the other.' ... \n'[T]he different factors may properly be accorded different weights depending on the \nparticular factual setting. A district court should utilize the factors that seem appropriate \nto a given situation.' ... \" Kos Pharms., Inc. v. Andrx Corp., 369 F.3d 700, 709 (3d Cir. \n2004) (citations omitted). \"The Lapp factors are best understood as 'tools to guide a \nqualitative decision.\"' Id. \n14. Degree of similarity (Lapp #1 ). The similarity of the marks is evaluated by \nlooking to the \"sight, sound, and meaning of the marks to determine whether the marks \ncreate the same overall impression when viewed as a consumer .\" A & H Sportswear, \n237 F.3d at 216. Because the test is likelihood of confusion by consumers in the \nmarketplace, the degree of similarity of the marks is assessed by looking at the marks \nas encountered by consumers in the marketplace, keeping in mind that side-by-side \ncomparisons generally are not appropriate.4 See Sabinsa Corp. v. Creative \nCompounds , LLC, 609 F.3d 175, 184 (3d Cir. 2010); A & H Sportswear, 237 F.3d at \n227. It makes sense, therefore, to assess \"the overall impression created by the mark \n4Unless consumers typically view the products side-by-side in the normal \nchannels of commerce. See Int'/ Data Grp., Inc. v. Ziff Davis Media, Inc., 145 F. Supp. \n2d 422, 434 (D. Del. 2001 ). It is possible that a search on the Apple App Store could \nbring these two marks up on the same page, but there has been no evidence of such. \n8 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 8 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>as a whole rather than simply comparing the individual features of the marks.\" Harlem \nWizards Entm't Basketball , Inc. v. NBA Props., Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1084, 1096 (D.N.J. \n1997). \n15. Certainly there is a degree of similarity between the look and sound of the \nwords \"Prizmia\" and \"Prisma.\" However, the marketplace presents the two marks very \ndifferently, which distinct presentations create distinct commercial impressions. The \nicons are very different.5 See Int'/ Data Grp., 145 F. Supp. 2d at 435 (\"[A]lthough there \nare some similarities between the marks at issue in terms of sound and meaning, the \nlook of the logo and the \ntrade dress distinguish CIO Insight from CIO Insider.\"). \nAdditionally, the respective purchase pages on the Apple App Store, from which a \nconsumer would download the parties' apps, create different, distinct impressions. (D.I. \n72 at 2) Further, the source of each of the apps is clearly identified on each of the \npurchase pages., that is, i4software is clearly displayed below the PRIZMIA® name on \nplaintiff's purchase page, and Prisma Labs, Inc. is clearly displayed below the app \nname on defendant's page. (Id.) See Harlem Wizards, 952 F. Supp. at 1096; Schmid \nLabs. v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 482 F. Supp. 14, 18 (D.N.J. 1979). The fact that \nthe PTO found defendant 's \"Prisma\" mark to be confusingly similar to \"PRIZMIA®\" is \nnot dispositive, given the fact that the PTO does not consider evidence of how marks \nare used in the marketplace . See A & H Sportswear , 237 F.3d at 221; Interstate \nBrands Corp. v. McKee Foods Corp., 2000 WL 187204 (T.T.A.B. 2000). The court \n5Notably, defendant's triangle icon connotes a prism, while plaintiff's icon more \nresembles the four rectangles of the GoPro logo. (Compare 0.1. 71, ex. 3 with ex. 6 \nwith D.I. 75, ex. 33) \n9 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 9 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>concludes, therefore, that Lapp factor #1 weighs in favor of defendant. \n16. Strength of \"PRIZMIA®\" mark (Lapp #2). In assessing the strength of a \nmark, the Third Circuit looks to both the conceptual and commercial strength of the \nmark as viewed in the context of the goods for which it is used. Fisons, 30 F.3d at 479. \nAs to conceptual strength, plaintiff's expert concedes that \"[t]he words PRIZMIA and \nPRISMA are both obvious derivatives of the word prism, itself borrowed from the Greek \nwork prisma .... \" (D.I. 68at1110) In this regard, defendant has presented credible \nevidence of the commonly understood meaning of the term \"prism,\" that is, an object \nthat filters light or color, particularly in connection with photography and art. (See, e.g., \nD.I. 75, exs. 2-7, 9-11) Indeed, the term \"prism\" and \"prism\"-derivative names have \nbeen extensively used by third parties for photo-editing apps. (See id., exs. 17-23) \nAside from plaintiff's declaration that in choosing the term \"Prizmia,\" he was \"striv[ing] to \nselect [a] non-descriptive , fanciful term[]\" (D.I. 71 at ,m 12, 14), there is no persuasive \nevidence that plaintiff succeeded in doing so. \n17. With respect to commercial strength, plaintiff concedes that \ndefendant's \n\"Prisma\" mark is \"commercially significantly stronger than [his] Prismia® mark.\" (D.I. 67 \nat 15) There is no evidence to the contrary. As asserted by defendant, \"[t]his is not a \ncase of a senior user being overwhelmed by a junior user. It is a case of a senior user \nthat could not compete in the market before the junior user ever made an appearance .\" \n(D.I. 72 at 13) For all these reasons, Lapp factor #2 weighs in favor of defendant. \n18. Consumer care in purchase (Lapp #3). Lapp factor #3 considers \"the \nprice of the goods and other factors ipdicative of the care and attention expected of \n10 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 10 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>consumers when making a purchase. \" A & H Sportswear , 237 F.3d at 234. As noted \nabove, plaintiff charges $7.99 for the \"Prizmia®\" app; defendant's \"Prisma\" app is free. \nPlaintiff argues that \"[d]efendant's free distribution of its product has fueled the viral \ndistribution of its product to over 70 million users and accelerated injury\" to plaintiff. \n(D.I. 67 at 15-16) Defendant notes that \"[t]he average price of apps in the Apple App \nStore is $1.01 and the majority of apps are available for free .... Consumers of mobile \napps understand the difference between a free app and one that charges Bx the price \nof an average app.\" (D.I. 72 at 15; D.I. 75, ex. 32) The court finds defendant has the \nbetter argument and evidence. Lapp factor #3 weighs in favor of defendant. \n19. Evidence of actual confusion . (Lapp #4 and #6). Evidence of actual \nconfusion is not required to prove likelihood of confusion; however, the lack of actual \nconfusion evidence can lead to an inference that continued use will not lead to \nconsumer confusion . Versa Prods. Co. v. Bifold Co. (Mfg.) Ltd., 50 F.3d 189, 205 (3d \nCir. 1995). Plaintiff offers the following evidence to support his allegations of actual \nconfusion: (1) the monthly Apple Analytics reports for plaintiff's \"Prizmia®\" app, which \nshow \"a dramatic monthly increase\" in the number of consumers who looked at the \n\"Prizmia®\" app and \"a corresponding decrease \" in the number of consumers buying it; \nand (2) one specific incident of a consumer who \"wrongly believed that he had \ndownloaded the Prizmia® app after hearing [plaintiff] pronounce the app name and \ndescribe the app.\" (D.I. 67 at 16) Defendant responds that the statistics demonstrate a \nlack of confusion on consumers ' part, that they have looked at plaintiff's app and made \na choice to download (or not) something other than plaintiff's app. Defendant also \n11 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 11 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>responds that the specific example of confusion provided by plaintiff reflects more a \n\"fleeting uncertainty\" than \"actual confusion.\" See Versa, 50 F.3d at 211. Finally, \ndefendant presented survey evidence that not a single participating consumer confused \nthe two apps at issue. (D.I. 73) On the whole, defendant has the more credible \nreasoning and evidence on these factors. The court concludes that, with at least 70 \nmillion downloads worldwide and a lack of persuasive evidence of actual confusion, \nactual confusion is not likely to occur. Lapp factors #4 and #6 weigh in defendant's \nfavor. \n20. Defendant's intent (Lapp #5). This factor weighs in favor of plaintiff. \nAlthough the record indicates that plaintiff had withdrawn his app from the marketplace \nwhen defendant launched its app, and although there is no evidence that defendant \nadopted its mark \"with the deliberate intent of pushing its rival out of the market,\" A & H \nSportswear, 237 F.3d at 225-26, defendant's assertion that a trademark search did not \nreveal plaintiff's registered mark is not credible. \n21. Competition and overlap (Lapp #7, #8, and #9). At a high level, the parties \nat bar sell similar apps through the same channels of trade. Upon closer inspection, \nhowever, there are distinct differences between the parties' products. In the first \ninstance, the court gives little weight to the fact that both apps are sold on the Internet, \nas that paints too broad a stroke for a trademark \ninfringement analysis in this context \nand with respect to the technology at issue. Moreover, despite plaintiff's description of \nhow a search is conducted on the Apple App Store, a search for plaintiff's \"Prizmia®\" \napp does not turn up defendant's app, and a search for defendant's \"Prisma\" app turns \n12 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 12 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>up numerous additional apps but not plaintiff's. In terms of functionality , this factor is \nsomewhat of a moving target, as plaintiff's app was designed with the \"singular goal of \nbeing the best accessory for \nGoPro cameras,\" but has been touted in this litigation as \nan app that focuses on \"professional and unique filters.\" (D.I. 71 at~ 13 and ex. 3) The \nfocus of defendant 's app has remained unchanged and is fundamentally different in \nfunction; while plaintiff broadly describes both apps as distributing \"photo filtering apps, \nthe record demonstrates that \ndefendant's app analyzes photos using artificial \nintelligence technology and then redraws the photos in a chosen artistic style, resulting \nin machine generated art. Given these very real differences in functionality, it stands to \nreason that the two products are directed to different consumers . Lapp factors #7, #8 \nand #9 weigh in defendant's favor. \n22. Conclusion as to likelihood of success on the merits. Based on the \nabove analysis, the court concludes that plaintiff has not carried his burden to \ndemonstrate that \ndefendant's \"Prisma\" mark is so similar to plaintiff's \"Prizmia® \" mark \nas to likely cause confusion in the marketplace. Therefore , plaintiff has also failed to \ncarry his burden of proving that he is likely to succeed on the merits of his trademark \ninfringement claim. \n23. Irreparable harm. In a Lanham Act case, \"[g]rounds for irreparable injury \ninclude loss of control of reputation , loss of trade, and loss of goodwill.\" Groupe SEB \nUnited States, Inc. v. Euro-Pro Operating LLC, 774 F.3d 192, 204 (3d Cir. 2014) \n(citation omitted). In this regard, plaintiff argues that defendant is a \"larger more \npowerful company \" that has interfered with the value of plaintiff's trademark , even while \n13 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 13 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>defendant is a new company with no revenue. (D.I. 67 at 19) As explained above, the \ncourt has rejected the notion that \ndefendant is a larger, more powerful company; it \nsimply launched a more successful product. There is no evidence of record that \nplaintiff has lost any value in his trademark because of the \"Prisma\" app -neither loss of \ntrade or of goodwill. Plaintiff has not carried his burden in this regard. \n24. Balance of harms. In balancing the equities between the parties, the court \n\"must balance the competing claims of injury and must consider the effect on each \nparty of granting or withholding the relief requested. \" Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008). In this case, plaintiff had de minimus sales of his \n\"Prizmia®\" app, both before and after defendant's launch. Unlike the record reflective \nof defendant's app, there is little evidence of any goodwill attributable to the \"Prizmia®\" \napp. (Compare , e.g., D.I. 75, ex. 16 with D.I. 71, exs. 9-13) With respect to the public's \ninterest, although the public certainly has a strong interest in protecting valid \ntrademarks, it also has an interest in promoting innovation . Considering all of the \nabove, the balance of harms weighs in favor of defendant. \n25. Conclusion. Weighing all of the factors discussed above in the totality of \nthe circumstances , see Kos Pharms., 369 F.3d at 711, the court concludes that plaintiff \nhas not carried his burden to demonstrate that the extraordinary remedy of a \npreliminary injunction is warranted on the record presented . Plaintiff's motion is denied. \nAn order \nshall issue. \n14 Case 1:16-cv-01307-SLR   Document 79   Filed 03/06/17   Page 14 of 14 PageID #: <pageID>",

    "summary": "1. **Summary:** In this case, Bobby M. Kemp, a federal prisoner, sued Meta Platforms Inc. alleging that Meta's AI technology intercepted and misused his electronic communications between 2015 and 2021. Kemp claimed violations under the Stored Communications Act (SCA), the Wiretap Act, and the Florida Constitution. However, the court dismissed Kemp's lawsuit, concluding that his claims were barred by res judicata because he had already litigated similar claims against Meta in a prior case, which had been dismissed with prejudice.\n\n2. **Key Legal Issue:** The key legal issue is whether the doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, barred Kemp from pursuing his current claims against Meta because they had already been litigated and decided upon in a previous case.\n\n3. **Court's Holding:** The court held that Kemp's claims were barred by res judicata as they involved the same parties, arose from the same transactional facts, and had reached a final judgment on the merits in the previous lawsuit he filed against Meta. Therefore, the case was dismissed with prejudice.\n\n4. **ELI5 Explanation:** Imagine you have a big brother who lets you borrow his toys, but you have to ask him first. One day, you think he read all your private notes and used them to make money from ads. You take this issue to your teacher, accusing your brother, but the teacher lets him go because you had already blamed him for the same thing last year. The teacher told you before that it doesn't count because you used the wrong rules to make your case.

BACKGROUND \n Plaintiff alleges  starting in September 2015, he created used the applications Facebook \nMessenger, Instagram Direct Messenger, and WhatsApp , all of which are owned by Meta, under \nseveral accounts on his phone and laptop computer.  D kt. 1 at 3, 8.   He alleges he sent and \nreceived over  5,000 “private electronic communications ” between  September 2015 and  June 2017, \nand 8,000 such communications  (including 2000 phone calls , as well as messages and photos ) \nbetween February 2018 and September 2021.  Id.  at 7-8.  He alleges in J une 2017, Meta developed \na large language model (“LLM”) that “‘read’ all of ” the “private electronic communications ” on \nFacebook Messenger, WhatsApp , and Instagram Direct Messenger.   Id. at 3.  Plaintiff  also alleges Case 5:24-cv-04257-SVK     Document 30     Filed 07/01/25     Page 1 of 6 \n2 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  that in March 2018, at the direction of Meta’s then -Chief Operating Officer, employees of Fair \nLabs developed an “Artificial Intelligence Machine ( “AIM”) that was integrated into”  Facebook, \nInstagram, and WhatsApp .  Id. at 5.  He alleges the AIM “monitor[ed]”––and “invoke[d]” Meta’s \nLLM to become “aware” of ––the “private electronic communications” in these applications.  Id. at \n6.  In addition to using the above applications for electronic communications, Plaintiff “purchased targeted Facebook ads” for his businesses.  Id.  at 7.   \n Plaintiff claims M eta violated the S tored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2702(a)(2), \n(“SCA”) by allowing its LLM to “read” the 5000 private communications he made between September 20 15 and June 2017.  Id.  at 9.  He also claims Meta violated the Wiretap Act, 18 \nU.S.C. § 2511, and Article 1, Section 12 of the Florida Constitution, by allowing its AIM  to \n“monitor” and “intercept” his “private electronic communications.”  Id .  He alleges Met a \nperformed the above actions to “give inferences for ad sales.”  Id. \n Plaintiff  previously filed  a case against Meta in the U nited States  District Court for the \nMiddle District of Florida .

A.\n1  The F irst Amended Complaint2 alleged  \nMeta, both as Facebook and as the “parent company” of WhatsApp and Instagram, engaged in the \n“improper use of Artificial Intelligence technology to intercept and misuse [his] electronic communications ” between 2015 and 2021, in violation of the SCA, Florida Statute Section  \n815.06(2)(a) , the Wiretap Act, and Fl orida Statute  § 501.204 ( Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade \nPractices Act ).  Dkt. 21- 2 at 10 -11.  The court screened the First Amended Complaint, dismissed it \nfor failure “ to state a claim on which relief may be granted ” and granted leave to amend.  Id.  at 15, \n24.  Plaintiff’s Second Amended Complaint alleged Meta and its “A.I. lab” “i ntentionally \n \n1 Meta’s requests for judicial notice of the filings and orders in Kemp I  (Dkts. 21-2, 22, 27-2, 27-3, \n28) (filings and orders from Kemp I )) are GRANTED .  See Harris v. Cnty. of Orange , 682 F.3d \n1126, 1132 (9th Cir. 2012) (federal courts may take judicial notice of undisputed matters of public \nrecord , including documents on file in federal or state courts). \n2 In Kemp I , the court granted Plaintiff’s request to amend his original complaint, which made \nsimilar allegations.  See Dkt. 21-2 at 7;  see id.  at 3-4 (alleging “intercept[ed his] electronic \ncommunications” from his computer and “ trained its Artificial Intelligence Mechanisms with the \nPlaintiffs photo taggings [sic] of others and himself in photos,” in violation of the Wiretap Act  and \nFlorida law ).

The court \ngranted Meta’s motion to dismiss, concluding Plaintiff “ failed to state a claim on which relief may \nbe granted ,” and entered judgment in favor of Meta.  Id.  at 94, 97.   \nII. DISCUSSION  \nA. Standard of Review  \nFailure to state a claim is grounds for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure.  Dismissal for failure to state a claim is a ruling on a question of law.  Parks School of Business, Inc., v. Symington, 51 F.3d 1480, 1483 (9th Cir. 1995).  “ The issue is not \nwhether plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether he is entitled to offer evidence to support his claim. ”  Usher v. City of Los Angeles , 828 F.2d 556, 561 (9th Cir. 1987). \n Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires only “a short and plain statement of the \nclaim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.”  “Specific facts are not necessary; the \nstatement need only give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.”   Erickson v. Pardus , 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007)  (citations and internal quotations \nomitted).  Although to state a claim a complaint “does not need detailed factual allegations, . . . a plaintiff ’s obligation to provide the grounds of his entitle[ment] to relief  requires  more than labels \nand conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. . . .   Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.”  Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly , 550 U.S. 544, 550 (2007) (citations omitted).  A motion to dismiss \nshould be granted if the complaint does not proffer “ enough facts to state a claim for relief that is \nplausible on its face. ”  Id. at 570.  \n   Allegations of fact in the complaint must be taken as true and construed in the light most \nfavorable to the non- moving party.  Sprewell v. Golden State Warriors , 266 F.3d 979, 988 (9th \nCir. 2001).  The court need not, however, “accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences.”  Id.  Case 5:24-cv-04257-SVK     Document 30     Filed 07/01/25     Page 3 of 6 \n4 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California   A pleading filed by a party unrepresented by counsel must be liberally construed, and “however inartfully pleaded, must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.”  Estelle v. Gamble , 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976) (internal quotations and citations \nomitted ).   \nB. Analysis \nMeta argues Plaintiff’s claims are barred under the doctrine of res judicata because he has \nalready pursued his claims in  Kemp I .  The doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion, bars a \nparty in successive litigation from pursuing claims that were raised or could have raised in a prior action.  Save Bull Trout v. Williams , 51 F.4th 1101, 1107 (9th Cir. 2022).  Claim preclusion \napplies where the earlier suit (1) involved the same claim or cause of action as the later suit, (2) reached a final judgment on the merits, and (3) involved identical parties or privies.  Id.   The party \nseeking to invoke claim preclusion bears the burden of establishing these elements.  Id .  There is \nno dispute that the parties in Kemp I and here are identical, i.e. Plaintiff and Meta.  Accordingly, the Court addresses the other two elements of res judicata.   \n1. Same Cause of Action \n“The central criterion ” in determining whether the  first and second suits involved the same \ncause of action  is “whether the two suits arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts. ” \nFrank v. United Airlines, Inc., 216 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).  T he allegations here and in Kemp I  clearly  arise out of the same “transactional nucleus \nof facts.”  Id.  In both cases, Plaintiff alleges Meta’s AIM intercepted his private electronic \ncommunications on Meta’s social media applications Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, between 2015 and 2021.  While he did not claim  a violation of the Florida Constitution in Kemp \nI,\n3 as he does here, this makes no difference to the res judicata analysis  because res judicata \napplies to claims in a successive suit that could have been brought in the earlier suit but were not .  \nSee Save Bull Trout , 51 F.4th at  1107 (emphasis added).  Because both Kemp I and the instant case  \n“arise out of the same transactional nucleus of facts ,” they involved the same cause of action s for \n \n3 As described above, in Kemp  I, Plaintiff  did make the other two claims he makes here, under the \nSCA and the Wiretap Act.  Case 5:24-cv-04257-SVK     Document 30     Filed 07/01/25     Page 4 of 6 \n5 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 \n16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  purposes of res judicata.  See Frank, 216 F.3d at 851. \nPlaintiff  argues this case also alleges M eta improperly exposed his stored communications  \nin its LLM  in violation of the SCA , which he did not allege in Kemp I .  Dkt. 26 at 8.  Th is \nargument is not persuasive.  Here, Plaintiff alleges that from 2015 to 2017 Meta violated the SCA by allowing its LLM to access his stored communications D kt. 1 at 9 ¶  30), and then once Meta \ndeveloped its AIM in 2018, the AIM “invoked” the LLM to access his communications stored therein.  I d. at 6  ¶¶ 15, 17.  Plaintiff alleged these facts in Kemp I also.  Specifically, he alleged \nMeta unlawfully “accessed” his “stored communication[s]” from “2015- 21,” which he claimed \nviolated the S CA.  Dkt. 21- 2 at 11 (citing 18 U.S.C . § 2701) .  He further alleged Meta used its \nAIM to unlawfully access these stored communications.   Id. at 11, 28.  Plaintiff ’s allegations in \nKemp I  that Meta unlawfully accessed his stored communications from 2015 to 2021, in part using \nits AIM,  constitute the “ same transactional nucleus of facts ” alleged her e, namely  that Meta \naccessed his stored communications for its LLM from 2015 to 2017, and then from 2018 to 2021, did so using its newly -developed AIM.  See Frank, 216 F.3d at 851.  Accordingly, Plaintiff’s \nargument is rejected.  \n2. Final Judgment on the Merits  \nIn addition to involving the same cause of actions  Plaintiff brings here, Kemp I  resulted in \na final judgment on the merits.  A dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted is a  final  decision on the merits  for purposes of res judicata .  Stewart v. U.S. Bancorp, 297 \nF.3d 953, 957 (9th Cir. 2002).  T he dismissal must also be  with prejudice .  Semtek Int’l Inc. v. \nLockheed Martin Corp., 531 U.S. 497, 505- 06 (2001) .   \nThe court in Kemp I  dismissed Plaintiff’s claims in the first amended complaint for failure \nto state a claim upon which relief may be granted  did so again after Plaintiff’s second attempt at \namendment, and entered judgment accordingly.  Plaintiff argues th is dismissal in Kemp I was not a \n“final judgment on the merits ” for purposes of res judicata  because the court did not specify the \ndismissal was with prejudice.  This is wrong.  In Stewart , as here, the district court in the \nplaintiff’s first case granted a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be grante d without indicating whether the dismissal was with or without Case 5:24-cv-04257-SVK     Document 30     Filed 07/01/25     Page 5 of 6 \n6 1 \n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 United States District Court  \nNorthern District of California  prejudice.  See 297 F.3d at  956.  The Ninth Circuit looked to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n41(b), which provides that “[u]nless the court in its order for dismissal otherwise specifies, a dismissal ... other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction,  for improper venue, or for failure to join \na party under Rule 19, operates as an adjudication upon the merits.”  Id.  (adding emphasis to \nlanguage of Rule 41(b) ).  After determining none of the exceptions in Rule 41(b) applied, the \nNinth Circuit concluded the prior dismissal was with prejudice and a final judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata.  Id.  at 956-59.   \nThe dismissal in Kemp I did not fall under the exceptions in Rule 41(b) because the court \ndid not dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19.  See Dkt.  21-2 at 18-23, 80-94.  Rather, the court  dismissed the case because the statutes \nPlaintiff cited did not provide a private right of action or, if they did, the allegations in the first and second amended complaints, when liberally construed in Plaintiff’s favor, did not satisfy the cause of action’s essential elements.  See Dkt.  21-2 at 18-23, 80-94.  As the dismissal in Kemp I  does not \nfall under one of the exceptions in Rule 41(b), it is properly considered a dismissal with prejudice, as well as a final judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata.   \n3. Conclusion \nIt is clear from the fac e of the complaint and judicially noticeable records that , even when \nliberally construed in Plaintiff’s favor, his claims are barred under the doctrine of res judicata.\n4   \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons described above, Meta’s motion to dismiss  and requests for judicial notice \nare GRANTED.  The case is DISMISSED  without leave to amend  and with prejudice. \nThe clerk shall enter judgment and close the file.  \nSO ORDERED.  \nDated:  July 1, 2025 \n  \nSusan van Keulen \nUnited States Magistrate Judge  \n \n4 In light of this conclusion, the Court need not address Meta’s alternative arguments that the \nclaims are untimely and fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.   \nCase 5:24-cv-04257-SVK     Document 30     Filed 07/01/25     Page 6 of 6",
