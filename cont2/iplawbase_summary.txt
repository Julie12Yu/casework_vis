"In the case of Bartz et al. v. Anthropic PBC, authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued the AI firm Anthropic for copyright infringement after Anthropic downloaded millions of copyrighted books from pirate sites and also purchased books to create a digital library that was used to train its large language model, Claude. The court found that the use of the authors' works to train Claude was a transformative fair use under Section 107 of the Copyright Act, but also determined that the unauthorized use of pirated copies for a general-purpose library was not a fair use. The ruling emphasizes that while training LLMs can qualify as fair use, the unlawful acquisition of copyrighted materials undermines any defense based on fair use."
"The case involves a copyright infringement claim by Jonathan Bertuccelli and Studio 3, Inc. against Universal City Studios and others, regarding the alleged unauthorized use of their artistic creation 'King Cake Baby' in the films 'Happy Death Day' and 'Happy Death Day 2U.' The court denied a motion from the defendants to exclude expert testimony from James T. Berger and Edward R. Griffor, who utilized AI-based methods to analyze perceived similarities between the King Cake Baby and the film's mask designs. Griffor's testimony included the use of facial recognition algorithms to substantiate claims of substantial similarity, which the court found relevant and admissible."
"In VB Assets, LLC v. Amazon.com Services LLC, the jury found that Amazon willfully infringed four patents related to smart speaker technology, specifically concerning the operations of its voice assistant, Alexa. The patents at issue included features for natural language processing, context-aware interactions, and advertisement selection based on user queries. The court granted some post-trial motions for an ongoing royalty and interest while denying enhanced damages, ultimately concluding that Amazon's infringement was not conducted with egregious misconduct, despite acknowledging the willfulness of its actions."
"In the case of Thaler v. Perlmutter, Dr. Stephen Thaler appealed the denial of his copyright application for an artwork titled 'A Recent Entrance to Paradise,' which he attributed to his AI, the 'Creativity Machine.' The United States Copyright Office denied the application, citing a requirement that only works authored by human beings are eligible for copyright registration. The D.C. Circuit Court affirmed this decision, emphasizing that the Copyright Act of 1976 mandates human authorship for copyright eligibility. The court found that the Creativity Machine, being a non-human entity, could not be considered an author under the law."
"UAB Planner 5D filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Princeton University for copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets, claiming that Princeton unlawfully scraped and downloaded data from its home design website, which included 3D objects and scenes. The court granted motions to dismiss the complaint, stating that Planner 5D failed to adequately allege copyright registration and the originality of its works, as well as insufficiently demonstrating trade secret protections. The case involves AI as the defendants allegedly used the downloaded data to enhance machine learning models for scene recognition, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of Planner 5D's intellectual property."
"In *Andersen et al v. Stability AI Ltd. et al.*, artists filed a class action lawsuit against Stability AI and others, alleging that the AI software Stable Diffusion was trained on their copyrighted artworks without permission. The court largely granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss, primarily citing the plaintiffs' failure to sufficiently specify their claims and the lack of copyright registrations by some plaintiffs. The plaintiffs were granted leave to amend their complaint to clarify how each defendant violated copyright laws and other rights, particularly in the context of AI-generated images that were derived from training data. The case raises significant questions regarding copyright infringement in the realm of AI, particularly how artwork is used for training AI without consent."
"Dr. Ahmad Aljindi filed a lawsuit against the United States, seeking $65.4 million for a Fifth Amendment takings claim and alleged retaliation by the Small Business Administration (SBA). He claimed that the government utilized his research on Information Security, AI, and Legacy Information Systems without permission, constituting a taking of his intellectual property. The court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, finding the takings claim time-barred, precluded by res judicata from earlier litigation, and not sufficiently plausible. The retaliation claim, related to the denial of an Economic Injury Disaster Loan for his business, was also dismissed as he was not permitted to represent his business pro se, violating court rules."
"In the case of Abbasi v. Bhalodwala, the plaintiff, Mohammad Umer Khan Abbasi, accused defendants Jipal P. Bhalodwala and RealTime Networking, Inc. of copyright infringement and unfair competition regarding his software, the Lottery Tracking System (LTS). Abbasi alleged that the defendants created a competing product that was substantially identical to LTS, using images and functionalities from his copyrighted material. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, affirming that the claims, including copyright infringement, unfair competition under the Lanham Act, and violations of state law, were sufficiently supported by the allegations that involved direct access to Abbasi's software and potential consumer confusion."
"In the case of Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., thirteen authors sued Meta, alleging copyright infringement for training its generative AI model, Llama, using their books downloaded from shadow libraries without permission. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and granted Meta's cross-motion, ruling that Meta's copying was fair use. The court found that the transformative nature of Meta's use, aimed at creating a tool for generating diverse text outputs, outweighed concerns about market harm, as plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of market dilution."
"In Tremblay et al v. OpenAI, Plaintiffs, authors of copyrighted books, allege that OpenAI improperly used their works to train its AI language models, including ChatGPT. The case focuses on claims of direct copyright infringement and secondary liability, alongside violations of the DMCA and unfair competition. The court granted OpenAI's motion to dismiss several claims while allowing the direct copyright infringement claim and part of the unfair competition claim to proceed, emphasizing that the outputs generated by AI must either directly replicate or substantially resemble the copyrighted works to establish liability."
