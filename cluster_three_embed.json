    "In the adversary proceeding Tashanna B. Golden v. Firstmark Services LLC et al., the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York dealt with a motion to strike the expert report of Mark Kantrowitz, submitted by the plaintiff, Tashanna Golden. The defendants contended that Kantrowitz's report improperly included legal opinions regarding the dischargeability of student loans under bankruptcy law, which infringed upon the court's role. The court granted the motion in part, excluding Kantrowitz's legal conclusions, but allowed portions of the report that offered expert opinion based on his experience and industry knowledge. Ultimately, the court emphasized its role in determining legal interpretations while considering relevant expert testimonies."

The dispute arose after a court order prohibited her from contacting her five children based on unsubstantiated abuse allegations.

Russell McDonald and Brenda Hale, both claiming under the 'per stirpes' language, were denied any recovery as their claims relied on an interest that did not exist. The court also noted that while pro se parties attempted to use AI for legal research, it led to incorrect arguments by Russell and Brenda, whereas Margaret used AI more effectively, though still resulting in cited sources that could not support her conclusions."

    "In the case of Lignos-Lopez et al. v. Servicios de Terapia Educativa Girasol, Inc. et al., the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico considered a motion for reconsideration regarding its prior dismissal of the plaintiffs' complaint, which alleged harm to their minor son while receiving special education services. The court initially dismissed the case due to the plaintiffs' failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). However, the court found that recent Supreme Court precedent indicated that such exhaustion was not required for claims seeking compensatory damages, which the plaintiffs asserted. The court granted the motion for reconsideration, allowing the plaintiffs to show cause why their case should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim, while reserving judgment on the exhaustion issue."

    "In the case of Aljindi v. United States, Dr. Ahmad Aljindi appealed the dismissal of his copyright infringement claim against the government, asserting that it used his intellectual property related to Information Security and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the lower court's dismissal, determining that Aljindi's allegations only pertained to ideas and concepts, which are not eligible for copyright protection under U.S. law. The court found that he failed to identify any specific expression that could be copyrighted, and thus affirmed the dismissal."

The court also dismissed her state law claims for emotional distress and defamation without prejudice, as it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction after dismissing the federal claims. Notably, the court struck Gonzalez's responsive briefing because her counsel used artificial intelligence to draft it, leading to the submission of misleading cases and errors."

    "In the case of Mid Central Operating Engineers Health and Welfare Fund v. HoosierVac LLC, attorney Rafael Ramirez faced sanctions for citing non-existent cases in legal briefs. The court found that Ramirez relied on generative artificial intelligence (AI) to draft these briefs without verifying the accuracy or existence of the cited cases, failing to conduct the requisite reasonable inquiry into the law as mandated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. The court recommended a $15,000 sanction for this misconduct and referred the matter for further disciplinary action."

    "In the case of Aljindi v. United States, Dr. Ahmad Aljindi appealed a dismissal from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims regarding his claims for compensation due to the alleged government use of his research on artificial intelligence and related systems, which he argued violated the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause. He sought $65.4 million, claiming a taking of his intellectual property and retaliation by the Small Business Administration for a denied loan for his business, AI Net Group LLC. The Claims Court dismissed his claims for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a viable claim, affirming that his takings claim was time-barred and barred by res judicata, and that his claims related to his LLC could not be prosecuted by him as a pro se plaintiff. Ultimately, the Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal."

    "In the case of Aljindi v. USA, Ahmad Aljindi, acting pro se, claimed that the federal government infringed on his copyright related to his scientific work on Information Security, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Legacy Information Systems. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims granted the government's motion to dismiss, finding that Aljindi failed to allege sufficient factual support for his claims, particularly because copyright protections do not extend to ideas or concepts, but only to their specific literary forms. Aljindi argued that the government infringed on his doctoral dissertation and related scientific findings, but the court concluded that he was seeking copyright for uncopyrightable ideas, and therefore dismissed the case."

United States Department of the Treasury, the plaintiff, Brooke Armbrister, a pro se litigant and self-described homeless resident of Dallas, filed a complaint claiming various legal rights as a Native American and presented incoherent and nonsensical arguments involving the U.S. Treasury, the FBI, and artificial intelligence. The court found her claims to be legally and factually frivolous, lacking any supporting legal authority or credible factual basis. As a result, the court recommended that her complaint be dismissed with prejudice. The mention of artificial intelligence in the case is related to Armbrister's claims of interactions with the FBI involving AI, but these assertions were deemed irrational and lacking substance."
