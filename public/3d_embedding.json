        "In the adversary proceeding Tashanna B. Golden v. Firstmark Services LLC et al., the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of New York dealt with a motion to strike the expert report of Mark Kantrowitz, submitted by the plaintiff, Tashanna Golden. The defendants contended that Kantrowitz's report improperly included legal opinions regarding the dischargeability of student loans under bankruptcy law, which infringed upon the court's role. The court granted the motion in part, excluding Kantrowitz's legal conclusions, but allowed portions of the report that offered expert opinion based on his experience and industry knowledge. Ultimately, the court emphasized its role in determining legal interpretations while considering relevant expert testimonies.",
        "In the case Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc., the plaintiffs alleged that the Flo Period and Ovulation Tracker app secretly transmitted sensitive health data related to menstruation and pregnancy to third parties like Google and Meta using their software development kits (SDKs), despite assurances of privacy from Flo. The court granted class certification for the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under California's Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), breach of contract, and intrusion upon seclusion, finding that the common issues in the case could be resolved on a classwide basis. The case highlights concerns over the integration of AI and automated systems in applications that handle sensitive personal information.",
        "In the case of David J. Ladouceur, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado dismissed his Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, finding that the filing was made in bad faith. The court highlighted that Ladouceur had leveraged the bankruptcy to halt foreclosure proceedings initiated by Wells Fargo, without any plan to make payments on secured debts. His proposals to reorganize were deemed unfeasible and primarily contingent upon uncertain state-level litigation against Wells Fargo. The judge concluded that the case primarily served the debtor's interests rather than those of his creditors, particularly given that he had not made payments on secured claims for over four years while living in properties valued significantly above his debts.",
        "In Tremblay et al v. OpenAI, Plaintiffs, authors of copyrighted books, allege that OpenAI improperly used their works to train its AI language models, including ChatGPT. The case focuses on claims of direct copyright infringement and secondary liability, alongside violations of the DMCA and unfair competition. The court granted OpenAI's motion to dismiss several claims while allowing the direct copyright infringement claim and part of the unfair competition claim to proceed, emphasizing that the outputs generated by AI must either directly replicate or substantially resemble the copyrighted works to establish liability.",
        "In the case of In re Palo Alto Networks, Inc. Securities Litigation, the plaintiffs, individual investors, filed a class action against Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and its executives, alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act due to misleading statements about the company's financials and business strategies involving AI-enhanced products. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, concluding that the plaintiffs failed to adequately plead both the existence of materially false statements and a strong inference of scienter. The dismissal was without prejudice, allowing plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint within 28 days.",
        "UAB Planner 5D filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Princeton University for copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets, claiming that Princeton unlawfully scraped and downloaded data from its home design website, which included 3D objects and scenes. The court granted motions to dismiss the complaint, stating that Planner 5D failed to adequately allege copyright registration and the originality of its works, as well as insufficiently demonstrating trade secret protections. The case involves AI as the defendants allegedly used the downloaded data to enhance machine learning models for scene recognition, raising concerns about the unauthorized use of Planner 5D's intellectual property.",
        "In Helo v. Sema4 Holdings Corp., the plaintiff alleged securities fraud against Sema4 and its executives, claiming that they made misleading statements regarding their AI-driven data platform, Centrellis, and financial performance, which inflated the company\u2019s stock price before a significant drop after revealing financial reversals. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege material misrepresentation or scienter under the Securities Exchange Act. The AI aspect was central to the allegations, as the company touted its Centrellis platform's capabilities to enhance personalized medicine and drive its market position.",
        "In the case Parker v. Perdue Foods, LLC, Roger Parker, representing himself and others similarly situated, engaged in a dispute with Perdue Foods over the confidentiality of documents produced during discovery. The court issued a proposed protective order to govern the handling of confidential information, allowing for the designation of documents as \"CONFIDENTIAL\" or \"CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY\" to protect sensitive and proprietary information. The case does not explicitly mention artificial intelligence or machine learning.",
        "In the case of Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., plaintiffs Richard Kadrey and others allege that Meta used copyrighted materials to train its Llama large language models without permission. The court addressed multiple requests for admission (RFAs) and motions to compel discovery from Meta regarding its use of copyrighted works, finding that Meta's claims concerning the need for deposit copies for determining copyright status were invalid. The court compelled Meta to provide clearer admissions regarding its use of copyrighted materials from specific books and ruled against Meta\u2019s objections concerning the production of documents related to licensing agreements and AI training datasets.",
        "In the case of Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., thirteen authors sued Meta, alleging copyright infringement for training its generative AI model, Llama, using their books downloaded from shadow libraries without permission. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and granted Meta's cross-motion, ruling that Meta's copying was fair use. The court found that the transformative nature of Meta's use, aimed at creating a tool for generating diverse text outputs, outweighed concerns about market harm, as plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of market dilution.",
        "In the case of In Re Cerence Stockholder Derivative Litigation, plaintiffs William Shafer and Peter Morse filed a derivative action against Cerence, Inc. and its directors alleging violations of the Exchange Act, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and insider trading. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that the plaintiffs failed to make a pre-suit demand on the board. The case revolves around the company's artificial intelligence-powered virtual assistants and the alleged misconduct in financial reporting related to fixed and variable license agreements, where the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants manipulated revenue reporting through a 'pull-forward' scheme, pushing customers into fixed contracts that inflated short-term financial results but jeopardized long-term revenue prospects.",
        "In Concord Music Group, Inc. et al. v. Anthropic PBC, the plaintiffs, consisting of major music publishing companies, accused Anthropic of using their copyrighted song lyrics to train its generative AI model, Claude, constituting copyright infringement and removal of copyright management information. The court granted Anthropic's motion to dismiss the contributory infringement, vicarious infringement, and removal of information claims, allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint. The case highlights the legal nuances surrounding AI's use of copyrighted materials, particularly in how Claude creates outputs that allegedly replicate protected song lyrics.",
        "In the case Coomer v. Lindell et al., Plaintiff Eric Coomer sued Defendants Michael J. Lindell, Frankspeech LLC, and My Pillow, Inc. for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and civil conspiracy, claiming they falsely stated he was involved in election interference during the 2020 presidential election. Coomer sought to exclude various pieces of evidence at trial, including personal matters like his motor vehicle accident, drug use, and opinions about law enforcement, resulting in a mixed ruling from the court on what evidence could be admitted. Notably, the court denied Defendants' attempt to introduce a corrected response document, which had issues related to citations generated by artificial intelligence, exemplifying AI's role in the legal proceedings.",
        "In the case of Shared.com v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Shared, a content creator, sued Meta for breach of contract and misrepresentation after being barred from using Facebook's advertising ecosystem, which significantly impacted its business. The court granted Meta's motion to dismiss some claims, particularly those related to publishing decisions protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, while allowing others concerning the lack of promised notifications regarding account suspension and insufficient explanations for ad rejections to proceed. The case also raised issues related to Facebook's reliance on automated systems for ad moderation, leading to claims that the platform failed to provide adequate details about ad rejections.",
        "In the case 'In re Google Generative AI Copyright Litigation', Plaintiffs alleged that Google LLC and Alphabet Inc. infringed on millions of copyrighted works to train its generative AI models. The court granted Google's motion to strike the class allegations due to the proposed class definition being deemed a 'fail-safe' class, meaning class membership depended on the success of individual copyright infringement claims. This improper definition required the court to make determinations on merit before class certification could be established. The court allowed Plaintiffs to amend their class definition within 14 days to resolve this issue and reiterate that class certification issues should be addressed with ample opportunity for discovery.",
        "In Concord Music Group, Inc. et al. v. Anthropic PBC, the plaintiffs, a group of music publishing companies, sought a preliminary injunction against Anthropic for allegedly using their copyrighted song lyrics to train its generative AI model, Claude. The court denied the request for the injunction, finding that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate irreparable harm from Anthropic's use of the lyrics for training purposes and that the scope of the requested injunction was overly broad and vague. The court also noted that the plaintiffs' claims related to both the input (the lyrics used for training) and output (the generated responses) of Claude had complexities that complicate enforcement.",
        "In the bankruptcy case of Stella Siomkos, the Chapter 7 Trustee, Albert Togut, sought an order compelling Siomkos to surrender an apartment valued at $2 million, which constituted a significant portion of her assets. Despite being repeatedly instructed to cooperate with the Trustee, Siomkos failed to comply with court orders and provide access to the property. The court ultimately granted the Trustee's application for turnover of the apartment, allowing for potential eviction after a notice period, while rejecting Siomkos's claims of fraudulent conduct by her attorneys, observing that her filings did not provide adequate evidence for her allegations.",
        "In the case of Jurgen Rogers v. United States Postal Service, plaintiff Rogers filed claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) alleging harassment and improper mail delivery by his mailman. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss due to Rogers' failure to adequately plead exhaustion of administrative remedies required for FTCA claims, indicating that he had not established he filed a formal complaint with the USPS regarding his issues. Additionally, the court raised concerns about inaccuracies in the plaintiff's legal citations and directed his counsel to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed for these errors.",
        "The case 'In Re Cerence Stockholder Derivative Litigation' involves a consolidated derivative action against Cerence, Inc. and its officers and directors, brought by shareholders William Shafer and Peter Morse. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Exchange Act and claims of breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and insider trading. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss based on a forum-selection clause, ruling that the amended bylaws of Cerence permit derivative actions under the Exchange Act to be brought in any federal court, thus allowing the case to proceed.",
        "In Concord Music Group, Inc. et al. v. Anthropic PBC, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California addressed discovery disputes involving sealing requests related to the AI model Claude developed by Anthropic. The court evaluated requests to seal sensitive metrics about Claude's usage, specific user prompts, and datasets used for training. Ultimately, the court granted some sealing requests, acknowledging the competitive sensitivity of the information, while denying others based on the relevance of public interest and prior disclosures.",
        "In the case of Tijerino v. Spotify USA Inc., Plaintiff Manuel Tijerino filed a motion to compel discovery and to deem requests for admission as admitted, claiming that Spotify\u2019s responses included boilerplate objections and inadequacies. The court, however, denied Tijerino's motions without prejudice, citing his failure to properly confer with Spotify in good faith and not adequately identifying the specific discovery disputes. Notably, during a crucial conference, Tijerino used an artificial intelligence program to formulate his responses, which led to misunderstandings and ultimately did not meet procedural requirements.",
        "In the case of 'In Re Mosaic LLM Litigation,' five authors sued Databricks and Mosaic ML, alleging copyright infringement related to the training of their large language models (LLMs) on datasets including the plaintiffs' copyrighted works. The court granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint to add a new claim against Databricks concerning its DBRX models and to update the list of infringed works, despite concerns about a lengthy delay in filing the amendment. This case highlights the legal implications of using authors' works in training AI models.",
        "Meghann R. Miller filed a lawsuit against the Kansas Department of Children and Families and other individuals involved in a child custody dispute, alleging civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983, 1985, and 1986, as well as violations related to the Americans with Disabilities Act. The dispute arose after a court order prohibited her from contacting her five children based on unsubstantiated abuse allegations. Miller's motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, aimed at overturning a DCF finding that allegedly relied on fabricated evidence regarding emotional harm due to her social media activity, was denied by the court, which found that she had not demonstrated exceptional circumstances warranting an ex parte order. The case also involved a selective AI certification requirement imposed by the judge, which Miller claims obstructed her access to justice.",
        "Ruben Santoyo appealed the denial of two post-judgment motions to reinstate his lawsuit against the City of Chicago and two police officers who arrested him for battery. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the lower court's decision, ruling that Santoyo's motions were frivolous and lacking evidence, particularly criticizing his vague allegations of judicial misconduct and his inappropriate citation of non-existent cases generated by an artificial intelligence program. The court warned that further frivolous appeals could result in sanctions.",
        "In the case of USA v. Linwei Ding, the court denied Ding's motions to dismiss the charges related to trade secret theft and for a bill of particulars. The case centers on Ding's alleged theft of trade secrets to benefit the People's Republic of China (PRC) through his artificial intelligence (AI) company. The government's evidence suggests that Ding linked his marketing efforts to PRC national policies on AI development and applied to programs that incentivize companies to relocate to China. The court emphasized that the statutory requirement does not necessitate proof of direct governmental involvement and that the concept of 'benefit' includes various forms beyond economic advantages. The indictment sufficiently informed Ding of the charges against him.",
        "The case Buckner v. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. involves pro se plaintiff Michael Buckner, who moved for the recusal of the presiding judge, citing potential conflicts of interest due to the judge's spouse's ties to a lobbying firm representing major corporations, including Microsoft. Buckner's claims stem from his termination at Tata Consultancy Services, including allegations of defamation and wrongful termination against Hilton and other parties. The court denied the motion for recusal, determining that the alleged connections did not present a reasonable question of the judge's impartiality. Additionally, Buckner faced criticism for citing non-existent case law in his filings, raising concerns about the use of artificial intelligence in creating legal documents, which was deemed a violation of his duty of candor to the court.",
        "In the case of Shared Partnership v. Meta Platforms, Inc., the plaintiff sought to compel Meta to expedite the production of documents related to the rejection of its advertisements on Meta's platform. The court found that the plaintiff's request for a strict deadline was unpersuasive, noting Meta's substantial resources and the complexity of locating relevant documents. The court addressed concerns about the relevance of Meta's use of artificial intelligence (AI) in ad rejections, stating that the broad requests regarding AI's role lacked relevant probative value for the plaintiff's specific claims and were deemed disproportionate. Overall, the court emphasized the responsibility of the parties to resolve discovery issues collaboratively.",
        "In the case of Coomer v. Lindell, the court addressed serious deficiencies in the Defendants' Opposition to a Motion in Limine, including nearly thirty erroneous citations to nonexistent cases and misrepresentations of legal principles. The defense counsel admitted to using generative AI tools in preparing their filings but failed to properly verify the accuracy of the citations. Consequently, the court sanctioned the lead attorney and their law firm for violating Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, imposing a monetary penalty of $3,000 on both the attorney and their associate due to their lack of due diligence and accountability in the submission.",
        "In the case Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society v. Hale et al., the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas presided over a statutory interpleader action concerning competing claims to $25,000 from a life insurance policy. The court granted summary judgment in favor of Margaret S. Wood, the alternate beneficiary, because the primary beneficiary, Owen McDonald, predeceased the insured, Anna McDonald, and therefore his interest never vested. Russell McDonald and Brenda Hale, both claiming under the 'per stirpes' language, were denied any recovery as their claims relied on an interest that did not exist. The court also noted that while pro se parties attempted to use AI for legal research, it led to incorrect arguments by Russell and Brenda, whereas Margaret used AI more effectively, though still resulting in cited sources that could not support her conclusions.",
        "In the bankruptcy case of Eugene Ezra Perkins, the court decided to dismiss the Chapter 13 case due to the debtor's failure to make required payments to the trustee within the statutory timeframe. Despite several attempts to amend his repayment plans and an assertion of misunderstanding the payment requirements, the court found no valid basis to avoid dismissal. Notably, the debtor used artificial intelligence to gather legal citations to support his arguments, which were deemed inaccurate and irrelevant, violating the standards for reasonable inquiry and representation in court.",

A significant issue arose from allegations that a non-party involved in the case, Danielle Morron, used artificial intelligence to draft numerous filings, raising concerns about the legitimacy of the pleadings and the unauthorized practice of law.

Reilly's lawsuit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915 for failing to state a viable claim. The court recognized concerns about Reilly's four claims, which included procedural due process and mail fraud, none of which appeared to have a legal basis.

ROSS Intelligence Inc., the plaintiffs sued ROSS for copyright infringement and tortious interference, while ROSS counterclaimed with allegations of antitrust violations under the Sherman Act, arguing that Thomson Reuters engages in unlawful tying practices by forcing customers to purchase bundled services. The court evaluated the antitrust claims, finding that ROSS sufficiently claimed separate product markets and denied dismissal of some counterclaims, but dismissed ROSS's claim of sham litigation due to a lack of specificity. The case highlights ROSS's development of a legal search platform utilizing artificial intelligence to compete against Thomson Reuters' Westlaw, which dominates the legal research market.",

        "In the case of Crain v. Upstart Holdings, Inc., plaintiffs allege securities fraud against Upstart and its executives following a dramatic drop in stock prices attributed to failures in its AI underwriting model during rising interest rates.

The claims did not demonstrate an improvement in computer technology but rather described conventional practices of collecting and analyzing data, thus deemed invalid.",

Anthropic PBC, authors Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber, and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued the AI firm Anthropic for copyright infringement after Anthropic downloaded millions of copyrighted books from pirate sites and also purchased books to create a digital library that was used to train its large language model, Claude. The court found that the use of the authors' works to train Claude was a transformative fair use under Section 107 of the Copyright Act, but also determined that the unauthorized use of pirated copies for a general-purpose library was not a fair use. The ruling emphasizes that while training LLMs can qualify as fair use, the unlawful acquisition of copyrighted materials undermines any defense based on fair use.",

The court concluded that there were too many unanswered questions regarding the defendant\u2019s mental condition and likelihood of responding to treatment, and emphasized the substantial likelihood of civil commitment rendering prosecution unnecessary.",

Salesforce.com, Inc., Plaintiffs, including G.G., who was trafficked at a young age, sued Salesforce for allegedly facilitating the operations of Backpage.com, a site known for illegal sex trafficking, through its customer relationship management software. The court dismissed the case with prejudice, ruling that Salesforce was protected under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields interactive computer service providers from liability for third-party content. Even if this provision did not apply, the Plaintiffs failed to adequately state a claim under federal anti-trafficking laws, as they could not demonstrate that Salesforce had the knowledge or involvement required for liability.",

HP Inc., the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine granted WEX a preliminary injunction against HP, preventing it from using the trademark \"WEX\" for its new software product, which could cause consumer confusion. The court found that the similarity of the marks, actual instances of confusion, and the strength of WEX's trademark indicated a likelihood of success on the merits for WEX. HP's software, marketed as HP WEX, includes AI features to manage connected devices and cybersecurity, although no financial services capabilities, which WEX also offers. The court emphasized the potential for irreparable harm to WEX's brand and reputation due to the market saturation of HP's product before the resolution of the case.",

Additionally, the individual defendants were granted qualified immunity.",
        "In the case of Cobb v. Intel Corporation, the plaintiff, Daniel Cobb, alleged wrongful termination based on age discrimination and retaliation for reporting nepotism and age discrimination.

Wynndalco Enterprises, LLC, the Seventh Circuit upheld a lower court ruling that Citizens Insurance had a duty to defend Wynndalco against claims alleging violations of Illinois\u2019 Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The court found the insurance policy's catch-all exclusion, which was invoked by Citizens to deny coverage, to be ambiguously broad, potentially eliminating coverage for various statutory injuries that the policy intended to cover.

MSC Cruises, S.A., the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida considered MSC's motion to compel arbitration in a personal injury claim filed by Marlon Leonel Mitchell Anderson, who was injured while working on an MSC cruise ship. The court, after reviewing a magistrate judge's report which recommended granting the motion based on equitable estoppel principles, concluded that MSC could compel arbitration despite being a non-signatory to the employment contract because Anderson's claims were sufficiently intertwined with the contractual obligations. The court affirmed the magistrate's report and granted MSC's motion, staying the case pending arbitration.",
        "In the case of Association of American Universities et al v. National Science Foundation et al, the plaintiffs challenged the NSF's implementation of a new policy capping indirect costs on grants to higher education institutions at 15%. The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, granting summary judgment and vacating the 15% cap as arbitrary and capricious, noting it contradicted existing regulations requiring acceptance of negotiated indirect cost rates. The ruling emphasized that the new policy did not provide a reasonable justification for deviating from negotiated rates and would lead to significant disruptions in research funding at affected institutions.",

        "In the case of Luokung Technology Corp. v. U.S. Department of Defense, the court granted a preliminary injunction preventing the Department of Defense from designating Luokung as a Communist Chinese military company (CCMC). The court found that Luokung demonstrated a high likelihood of success on its claims of arbitrary and capricious agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act, as the agency failed to provide substantial evidence supporting the CCMC designation. The court noted that the designation lacked a rational basis and violated the statutory authority, as Luokung does not appear to be effectively controlled by the PRC or its military and is primarily involved in civilian technology and AI applications.",
        "In the case of W.A. v. Clarksville-Montgomery County Schools, the court reviewed an administrative ruling that found W.A., a student with disabilities, was denied a Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) due to the school district's failure to provide adequate support for his dyslexia and other learning needs. The court upheld the Administrative Law Judge's decision that required 888 hours of dyslexia-specific tutoring but did not mandate a specific provider. The court noted that W.A.'s academic success was largely due to the use of assistive technology, which allowed him to bypass traditional reading and writing skills, rather than to his actual proficiency in those areas.",
        "In the case of Freedom Cheteni v. Malia Vella et al., the plaintiff claims discrimination and retaliation by state officials regarding the Emergency Assistance for Non-Public Schools (EANS) program. The court partially granted and denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing two claims with prejudice while allowing others to proceed, including allegations of due process violations and retaliation. The ruling emphasizes the importance of standing and identifies that Cheteni has enough personal harm to pursue certain constitutional claims, even though the claims related to racial discrimination in contract under \u00a7 1981 were dismissed due to lack of standing.",
        "The case involves James Strader, who filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, challenging his state convictions related to kidnapping and attempted rape. The court directed Strader to show cause why the petition should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted, noting that many of his claims were more suitable for relief under \u00a7 2254 or related to conditions of confinement appropriate for a \u00a7 1983 action.

Central to the dispute was the use of AI technology by both companies to assist in dental diagnostics, with Overjet alleging that Videa copied features of its software, although Videa claimed to have developed similar features independently.",
        "In the case GovernmentGPT Incorporated et al. v. Axon Enterprise Incorporated et al., the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the use of Axon's Body 4 Cameras at political events, citing national security risks due to Quectel chips allegedly used in the devices, which the plaintiffs argued could facilitate espionage by the Chinese Communist Party. However, the court denied the motion for the injunction, stating that the plaintiffs failed to establish a direct connection between their antitrust claims and their national security concerns, lacked standing due to speculative harm, and did not provide sufficient evidence to support their allegations about the presence of Quectel chips in the cameras.",
        "In the case 'Pathways Management Services, LLC et al v. Northstar Hospital et al', the plaintiffs allege that the defendants misappropriated their confidential business information to establish a competing facility.

        "In the case EMC Corporation v. Clouding Corp., the Federal Circuit vacated and remanded a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) which upheld the validity of claims related to a patent involving an AI engine used to diagnose and solve computer system problems. EMC argued that the claims were unpatentable based on prior art references, specifically alleging that the combination of the teaching from U.S. Patent Nos. 5,664,093 (Barnett) and 5,581,664 (Allen) suggested the method of saving a computer system's state when a solution could not be determined. The court found that the PTAB erred by not properly addressing EMC's arguments regarding the AI engine's role in determining unsolvable problems, thus remanding for further consideration of whether the prior art combination suggested saving the state of the computer system.",
        "In the case of Citizens Insurance Company of America v. Wynndalco Enterprises, LLC, the court addressed whether Citizens Insurance had a duty to defend Wynndalco against class action lawsuits alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to Wynndalco's sale of facial recognition products developed by Clearview AI.

        "Loop AI Labs Inc. sued former CEO Anna Gatti and various other defendants, alleging conspiracy to misappropriate trade secrets and sabotage investor negotiations. The case involved a third-party law firm, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, which was subpoenaed for documents related to its prior representation of Loop and concurrent representation of the Italian Almaviva Defendants. Orrick sought to quash the subpoena, citing attorney-client privilege and the burden of compliance. The court ruled that federal privilege law applied and determined that Orrick could not withhold communications under the attorney-client privilege due to a potential conflict of interest, but ordered the production of two non-privileged documents.",
        "In the case of Bonazza v. MUFG Bank, the plaintiff, Michael Alan Bonazza, faced sanctions for abusive litigation tactics, including sending thousands of irrelevant and harassing emails to court staff and defendant's employees.

The court denied the motions to dismiss for Mission City and Leininger, finding sufficient allegations of their involvement, while it granted the motion to dismiss for Michael Huckabee, concluding that he did not have the authority to control the telemarketing actions, thus lacking grounds for liability.",
        "James Dean Kendrick filed multiple FOIA requests with the DEA seeking records related to his criminal conviction. The DEA conducted several searches and released a total of 28 pages, with some information redacted under various exemptions. Kendrick, dissatisfied with the responses, sued the DEA. The court concluded that while some searches conducted by the DEA were inadequate, the agency properly invoked FOIA exemptions to justify the redactions of certain information.

        "In the case of Kevin J. Meehan v. VIPKid et al., the plaintiff filed a putative class action against multiple defendants, including VIPKid and its affiliates, alleging common law fraud, deceptive business practices, and violations of New York Labor Law related to unpaid wages, among other claims. Central to the case was an Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) which contained an arbitration provision. The court ultimately ruled to compel arbitration for all claims related to the ICA, concluding that any disputes arising from the agreement or the plaintiff's classification as an independent contractor must be resolved through arbitration. Additionally, the claims against certain defendants were dismissed due to lack of personal jurisdiction, particularly those associated with Tencent and other entities that did not conduct business in New York.",
        "In the case of USA v. Sylvester Gailes, the Sixth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9), which prohibits individuals convicted of domestic-violence misdemeanors from possessing firearms. Gailes, a repeat domestic violence offender, challenged the statute as a violation of his Second Amendment rights, citing the Supreme Court's ruling in Bruen. The court ruled that despite Bruen's implications, the law is consistent with historical firearm regulation traditions that aim to prevent violence by individuals posing a clear threat, thereby affirming the lower court's decision and denying Gailes's motion to dismiss the indictment.",

        "In the case of Dehghani v. Castro, attorney Felipe D.J. Millan faced sanctions for submitting a habeas corpus response that cited non-existent cases, which he attributed to an assistant at LAWCLERK who drafted the response. The court found that Mr. Millan failed to adequately review the document before filing it, violating Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The reliance on AI-generated or inaccurately referenced case law was a significant factor in the sanctions imposed, highlighting the responsibility of attorneys to verify the accuracy of submissions regardless of the sources used, including outsourced legal work.",
        "In the matter of In re Stem, Inc. Derivative Litigation, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware addressed objections to a Magistrate Judge's Report recommending the dismissal of various claims against Stem, Inc. and its defendants, who are board members and executives of the company, which specializes in AI-driven clean energy storage systems.

        "In the case of Lazares v. Shopify (USA) Inc., the plaintiff, Matthew Lazares, filed a putative class action alleging that Shopify misclassified him and other commissioned sales employees as exempt from overtime pay in violation of California labor laws. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California granted Shopify's motion for judgment on the pleadings, determining that Lazares failed to demonstrate he lacked an adequate remedy at law to pursue his claims under the California Unlawful Competition Law (UCL) and lacked standing to seek injunctive relief due to not alleging imminent harm as a former employee. The court dismissed Lazares's UCL claim without leave to amend.",
        "In the case Cahoo et al v. SAS Analytics Inc. et al, the United States District Court addressed the admissibility of expert witness testimony regarding the Michigan Integrated Data Automated System (MiDAS).

District of Columbia, the U.S. District Court denied the plaintiff's motion for leave to file a second amended complaint regarding claims related to the termination of his health insurance by the District of Columbia and its officials. The court found that the proposed amended complaint, despite being Rubio's fourth attempt, did not cure previous deficiencies or provide sufficient detail to support his claims, including those under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Notably, the proposed complaint appeared to include fabricated case citations, likely generated by artificial intelligence, which raised concerns about the validity of Rubio's allegations and compliance with legal standards.

(operating as Paro Inc.), sought an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO) against its former employee Luke Kohan and his new company FirmKey Solutions, alleging breach of a non-compete clause in Kohan's employment agreement. The court denied Paro's TRO request due to insufficient likelihood of success on the merits, finding the non-compete covenant overly broad and more restrictive than necessary to protect Paro's legitimate business interests. The case involves the context of AI as Paro provides AI-powered financial and accounting solutions, although the main legal issues revolve around employment contracts and trade secrets without direct mention of specific AI applications.",

The core of the complaint revolves around claims that VIPKid misrepresented employment conditions to attract teachers. The case was removed to federal court under the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA), and Plaintiff sought to remand it back to state court, arguing that federal jurisdiction was not warranted mainly due to his claims being grounded in state law rather than federal law. The involvement of AI arises from allegations that VIPKid exploited teachers' images and likenesses to develop artificial intelligence technologies for its services without consent, leading to claims of violating civil rights laws.",
        "In the case of Damion Perrine v. Sega of America, Inc. et al., plaintiffs alleged that the video game 'Aliens: Colonial Marines' was marketed with misleading advertisements showcasing a superior version of the game that was not delivered in the retail version. The court denied plaintiff John Locke's motion for class certification due to the proposed class being overly broad and lacking ascertainability, as many potential class members could not reliably identify which advertisements they had seen. Additionally, Gearbox's motion for dismissal based on an arbitration clause in its End User License Agreement was denied, as the court determined the case did not pertain to the online features defined in the EULA.",

Chen's allegations centered around his poor performance review and subsequent termination, which he believed were due to personal conflicts with his supervisors and not due to discriminatory practices.",
        "The case Golan et al. v. Veritas Entertainment, LLC et al. involved plaintiffs Ron Golan and Dorit Golan filing a putative class action against several defendants for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and Missouri's Do Not Call Law due to unsolicited pre-recorded calls promoting the movie 'Last Ounce of Courage.' The defendants, including notable figures and companies, moved to dismiss the charges, citing lack of sufficient allegations linking them to the calls.

        "In the case of Blue Spike, LLC v. Google Inc., the court granted Google's motion for judgment on the pleadings, ruling that the asserted claims of five patents held by Blue Spike, which pertain to computer-based content comparisons, are invalid as they embody an unpatentable abstract idea under Section 101 of the Patent Act. The patents describe methods for creating digital fingerprints from various signals to determine content similarities, but the court found that they do not involve an inventive concept, as they primarily mirror cognitive processes that humans can perform, thereby failing to meet the standards for patentability.",

Director, USCIS, Harshkumar Patel, an Indian national, filed a lawsuit against the USCIS Director due to delays in processing his I-918 Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status and his Application for Employment Authorization. He claimed that the delay was unlawful and harmful, seeking judicial intervention under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim, as the discretion regarding employment authorization under the U-Visa process was established by statute, which precluded judicial review. Consequently, Patel's complaint was dismissed without prejudice.",
        "In the case Golan et al. v. Veritas Entertainment, LLC et al., plaintiffs Ron and Dorit Golan filed a putative class action against multiple defendants, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and Missouri's Do Not Call Law due to unsolicited pre-recorded calls promoting the movie 'Last Ounce of Courage,' which featured recorded messages using the voice of Mike Huckabee. The court addressed motions to dismiss filed by several defendants, questioning whether sufficient facts were presented to establish liability and exploring issues of standing and class representation. The case raises significant questions about the involvement of automated systems in telemarketing and the possible vicarious liability of sellers for violations by third-party telemarketers using artificial intelligence-driven call systems.",
        "In the case of Lignos-Lopez et al. v. Servicios de Terapia Educativa Girasol, Inc. et al., the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico considered a motion for reconsideration regarding its prior dismissal of the plaintiffs' complaint, which alleged harm to their minor son while receiving special education services. The court initially dismissed the case due to the plaintiffs' failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). However, the court found that recent Supreme Court precedent indicated that such exhaustion was not required for claims seeking compensatory damages, which the plaintiffs asserted. The court granted the motion for reconsideration, allowing the plaintiffs to show cause why their case should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim, while reserving judgment on the exhaustion issue.",
        "In the case of Andrew Forrest v. Meta Platforms, Inc., Dr. Forrest alleges that Meta's platforms displayed ads fraudulently using his name and likeness to promote cryptocurrency scams, resulting in significant financial harm to Australian users. The court partially granted Meta's motion to dismiss, affirming that Dr. Forrest's claims related to misappropriation of identity and negligence were adequately pleaded, while dismissing other claims, including negligent failure to warn and unjust enrichment. A key aspect of this case involves Meta's automated ad systems, which Dr. Forrest argues actively contributed to the creation and dissemination of misleading ads, particularly through their use of AI tools that enhance ad content and targeting.",
        "In the case of Kohls v. Bonta et al., Plaintiff Christopher Kohls, a political content creator known for using AI to create parody videos, challenged the constitutionality of California's AB 2839. The law, enacted to counter AI-generated deepfakes deemed materially deceptive during election periods, allowed lawsuits against individuals spreading such content. The court granted a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of AB 2839, ruling that it likely violated the First Amendment by imposing undue restrictions on political speech and compelling speech through onerous disclosure requirements, thus suppressing satire and parody.",
        "In the case of Sam Monet v. State of Hawaii et al, the U.S. District Court denied Plaintiff's Motion for Reconsideration of a prior order from October 31, 2023, which had granted summary judgment to several defendants and denied Plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment. The court found that Plaintiff's arguments for reconsideration were untimely and did not demonstrate extraordinary circumstances. Additionally, the court dismissed Plaintiff's Second Motion for Judicial Disclosure, stating that no remaining claims warranted such disclosure. Notably, Plaintiff raised unsubstantiated allegations that the court's earlier order was generated by artificial intelligence, but these claims were dismissed as lacking factual basis.",
        "In the case of Ferlito v. Harbor Freight Tools USA, Inc., the plaintiff, Joseph Ferlito, sued the defendant for a defective axe that caused him injuries. The court denied the defendant's motion to exclude the plaintiff's proposed expert witness, Mark Lehnert, despite arguments challenging his qualifications and the reliability of his testimony.

        "In Loop AI Labs Inc. v. Gatti et al., the plaintiff, Loop AI Labs, a startup developing artificial intelligence technologies, faced a motion from defendants IQSystem, Inc. and Almawave USA, Inc. to enforce a court order requiring the plaintiff to adequately disclose its trade secrets per California's Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The court found that the plaintiff's trade secret disclosure failed to meet the required standards of reasonable particularity, as it merely categorized information without specifying the actual trade secrets. The court granted the motion, highlighting that the plaintiff did not comply with prior orders to thoroughly identify the trade secrets, deferring sanctions for non-compliance to a later ruling.",
        "William Lorenzo Coleman filed a civil rights lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the City and Borough of Juneau and police officer Tyler Reid, claiming various constitutional violations stemming from his arrest on September 25, 2020, including excessive force, malicious prosecution, and fabrication of evidence. The court dismissed Coleman's complaint for failing to meet the necessary pleading requirements but granted him leave to amend his complaint by providing more specific allegations. The complaint made references to 'Artificial Intelligence' in the context of fabricated evidence, suggesting that Coleman claimed police planted evidence related to AI; however, the court did not find adequate factual support or clarity regarding how AI was involved in the alleged misconduct.",
        "In the case 'In re Clearview AI, Inc. Consumer Privacy Litigation,' plaintiffs, community organizations and political activists, sued Clearview AI for allegedly unlawfully acquiring and selling likenesses through its facial recognition database, which scraped billions of images from social media. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion to remand the case to state court, determining that plaintiffs had a reasonable possibility of succeeding on claims against non-diverse municipal defendants under the California Constitution, despite Clearview's arguments regarding fraudulent joinder. Clearview's use of AI technology to create a searchable database that could identify individuals based on facial features was central to the allegations of privacy invasion.",

Additionally, the court raised concerns about the statute of limitations, as the events in question occurred over 50 years ago.",
        "In the case of Loop AI Labs Inc. v. Gatti et al., the plaintiff, Loop AI, a startup focused on artificial intelligence technology, accused its former CEO Anna Gatti and other defendants of conspiring to undermine its business by misappropriating confidential information and obstructing fundraising efforts. The defendant IQ System, Inc. counterclaimed for intentional interference with contractual relations, but Loop AI moved to strike this counterclaim under California's anti-SLAPP statute, arguing that the counterclaim stemmed from protected speech during litigation. The court granted Loop AI's motion to strike, concluding that IQ System failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its claim, especially since the statements in question were protected by California's litigation privilege.",
        "In the case UMB Bank National Association v. Margaret L. Gauthier, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine denied Gauthier's amended emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and a stay of a receivership order. Gauthier's motions were criticized for containing numerous misquotations and miscitations, which the Court suspected may have resulted from her reliance on artificial intelligence software in drafting her submissions. The Court found that Gauthier failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, or that the balance of equities favored her position, concluding that the arguments based on jurisdiction and standing were unpersuasive and previously addressed.",
        "In the case X Corp. v. Bright Data Ltd., a social media platform (formerly Twitter, now X) filed a complaint against Bright Data for alleged contract violations related to data scraping. Bright Data counterclaimed, alleging that X's updated terms of service unreasonably restrain trade and competition by prohibiting data scraping, which is essential for AI and analytic services. Bright Data, specializing in scraping public data from platforms like X, argued that X's restrictions harm competition in the market for publicly available data, which is vital for AI applications, as it helps businesses and researchers derive insights from real-time social interactions.",
        "In the case of Concentrix CVG Customer Management Group Inc. v. Stephan J. Daoust, the plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction against the former employee, asserting that Daoust breached a non-compete agreement by accepting a position with a competitor, TaskUs, and allegedly misappropriating trade secrets. The court denied the motion for an injunction, finding that Concentrix did not establish a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its claims, particularly regarding the enforceability and reasonableness of the non-compete agreement and failure to demonstrate the existence of trade secrets. The court highlighted that Daoust's new role at TaskUs was broader than his previous position at Concentrix, and enforcement of the non-compete would stifle ordinary competition.",
        "In the case of Ogletree v. Cleveland State University, the plaintiff, Aaron Ogletree, challenged the university's remote testing policy that required students to conduct room scans of their surroundings before taking online exams, arguing it violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

        "In the bankruptcy case of Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. et al. v. John H. Owoc et al., the court ruled that Vital Pharmaceuticals owns the rights to three disputed social media accounts created during Owoc's tenure as CEO. Despite claims from Owoc asserting ownership based on his cultivated persona and personal posts, the court found that the majority of the account content served to market Vital's products. The case highlighted the lack of legal clarity regarding ownership rights of social media accounts and emphasized the significance of documented property interests and control over access in determining ownership.",
        "In the case of Intellectual Ventures II LLC v. FedEx Corporation et al., the plaintiff, Intellectual Ventures, alleged that FedEx infringed on five of its patents. Defendants filed motions under Rule 12(c) claiming the patents were invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, along with extraneous materials not part of the original complaint. Intellectual Ventures sought to convert these motions to summary judgment due to the inclusion of additional evidence. The court granted an extension for Intellectual Ventures to respond and deferred any decision on the conversion until after reviewing the responses, recognizing the precedential importance of claim construction and potential factual disputes in the validity analysis.",
        "In the case Naughton v. Amazon.com, Inc. et al., William Naughton, on behalf of himself and a class of employees, accused Amazon of collecting sensitive biometric data, specifically facial geometry scans, without consent as part of mandatory wellness checks during the COVID-19 pandemic, violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).

Keith Gerdes, the Sixth Circuit upheld the district court's granting of a preliminary injunction against Gerdes, a former regional vice president at RGIS, who left the company to work for a direct competitor in violation of a noncompete clause in his employment agreement. The court found that RGIS was likely to succeed on its claims of breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets, given Gerdes's immediate employment with a competitor and his retention of RGIS property. The court rejected Gerdes's arguments regarding lack of personal jurisdiction and his procedural complaints, affirming the injunction that prohibited him from working for the competitor and disclosing RGIS's trade secrets.",
        "In the case of uSens, Inc. v. Shi Chi, the plaintiff, uSens, sought a preliminary injunction against former consultant Shi Chi for alleged trade secret misappropriation, including disclosing confidential information from business meetings and failing to return a company laptop and cell phone.

        "In the case of PredictiveIQ LLC v. USA, PredictiveIQ sought a preliminary injunction against the U.S. Air Force's award of contracts under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, arguing that the Air Force violated the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) by failing to stay contract awards during a protest period. The Court, however, denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that PredictiveIQ did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits, suffered no irreparable harm, and that granting the injunction would not serve the public interest. The case underscores the discretion afforded to agencies in managing SBIR contracts, which are geared towards fostering innovation and technological advancements, including in fields like artificial intelligence and machine learning.",
        "In Aljindi v. United States, Dr. Ahmad Aljindi appealed a dismissal from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which ruled it lacked jurisdiction over his claims, including employment discrimination and intellectual property theft. The Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal of these claims but vacated the ruling regarding a potential copyright infringement claim, remanding the case for further consideration. The court emphasized that the Tucker Act limits the Court of Federal Claims' jurisdiction, particularly over tort claims and employment discrimination, indicating that the district courts hold exclusive jurisdiction over such matters.",

This case exemplifies the legal complexities inherent in litigation concerning AI technology, as the court ruled that topics related to trade secret misappropriation and damages claims were permissible for inquiry.",
        "In the case of Rex Real Estate I, L.P. v. Rex Real Estate Exchange, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed Rex Exchange's appeal after finding that it had forfeited its argument regarding the finality of the district court's dismissal of claims. Rex I had previously filed for a voluntary dismissal without prejudice under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2) due to Rex Exchange ceasing operations and concerns over its ability to satisfy potential judgments. While Rex Exchange incorporated AI technology in its operations linking buyers with properties, the core legal issue revolved around trademark infringement and the procedural aspects of appeal, rather than direct implications of AI or automated systems.",
        "In the case of Synergy Advisory Services LLC v. ClearPrism LLC, the court ruled in favor of Synergy, granting their Motion for Partial Summary Judgment for breach of contract.

Facebook et al., the plaintiff, an incarcerated individual, filed a pro se civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that he was exposed to 'illegal A.I. emissions' which he claims caused him to hear voices and led to feelings of suicide. The court found the complaint largely incomprehensible and dismissed it as frivolous, stating there were deficiencies in the plaintiff's claims, particularly that the defendants (social media companies and their leaders) could not be considered state actors under \u00a7 1983. The plaintiff was ordered to provide a valid response by a specified deadline or face dismissal.",
        "In the case of Isaac Anthony Thomas v. Genesee County Sheriff's Department, the plaintiff, proceeding in forma pauperis, filed a lawsuit alleging unspecified claims against the defendants. The court addressed multiple motions, including striking the plaintiff's unauthorized reply to the defendants' answer and his notice of incorporation of his original complaint. The plaintiff was granted leave to file a second amended complaint and his requests for the appointment of counsel and submission of video evidence were denied due to procedural violations and a lack of demonstration of exceptional circumstances. The case does not explicitly involve artificial intelligence or machine learning; however, the plaintiff referenced using AI in drafting motions, which the court warned would not absolve him of responsibility for the filings.",

Wemagine.AI LLP, the plaintiff, Ricardo Gutierrez, filed a putative class action alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) due to Wemagine's collection and use of biometric data from users of its AI-based application, Voila AI Artist, without consent. The court granted Wemagine's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, ruling that Gutierrez failed to demonstrate sufficient contacts between Wemagine, a Canadian company, and the state of Illinois, as the only connection was Gutierrez's use of the app. The court emphasized the need for a stronger link between the defendant's activities and the forum state for personal jurisdiction.",
        "In the case of Birmingham et al. v. Rofx.net et al., the plaintiffs, a group of investors, claimed they were defrauded by RoFx.net, a purported foreign exchange platform that, according to them, was a sham operated with underlying fraudulent activities.

The court found that the plaintiffs did not establish sufficient facts to demonstrate that EPS was involved in a conspiracy or that it purposefully engaged in activities that would subject it to the jurisdiction of Florida courts. Ultimately, the court granted EPS's motion to dismiss on the grounds of insufficient personal jurisdiction.",
        "In the case of Pritchard v. Thompson et al., the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, which included claims of trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement related to a dashcam with artificial intelligence capabilities invented by Chris A.

Xytex Corporation, the plaintiffs, a same-sex couple, alleged wrongful birth after discovering that the sperm donor they used, James Aggeles, had provided false information regarding his educational background and mental health history. They argued that if they had known the truth about Aggeles, they would not have used his sperm, resulting in the births of their two children. The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, determining that the claims were fundamentally wrongful birth claims, which are not recognized under Georgia law, as such claims require the court to make value judgments about the life of a child with disabilities versus no life at all.",

Fouts, along with his minor child, filed a complaint alleging multiple constitutional and statutory violations involving various Kentucky and federal agencies, mainly related to issues with social security, health care, and a Child Protective Services investigation. The Northern District of California, where the case was filed, determined that venue was improper as both plaintiffs and relevant events were centered in Kentucky. Consequently, the court transferred the case to the Western District of Kentucky for proper handling. The involvement of AI was noted in Fouts's subsequent filings, where he referenced using artificial intelligence for drafting documents, although the court did not address these filings as it focused on the venue issue.",
        "In the case of Vanness v. Musk, Craig Vanness filed a class action complaint alleging that Elon Musk uses his company Neuralink for government mind control via a form of 'electronic torture' linked to an 'Acoustic Fingerprint' technology. The court dismissed Vanness's complaint with prejudice as frivolous, noting that it lacked any substantial merit and did not meet the criteria for proceeding in forma pauperis due to Vanness having three prior strike cases. The court found the claims to be delusional and a mockery of the judicial process.",
        "In the case Lambda Labs, Inc. v. Lambda, Inc., Lambda School moved to compel Lambda Labs to provide more detailed responses to interrogatories regarding their goods and services related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The court found Lambda Labs' responses inadequate and ordered them to amend their response within seven days to better delineate their offerings and the applicable trademarks. Additionally, Lambda School sought a protective order to limit deposition inquiries, which the court denied, stating that all areas of inquiry were relevant to the trademark dispute concerning potential customer confusion over the services attributed to the two entities.",
        "In the case of Jane Doe v. Xytex Corporation, the plaintiff, Jane Doe, brought a wrongful birth suit against Xytex and associated individuals after discovering that the sperm donor she used for artificial insemination, James Aggeles, had falsified his educational and mental health history. The court determined that all of the plaintiff's claims derived from a wrongful birth theory, which is not recognized under Georgia law, leading to the dismissal of the case. The case highlights the complexities of genetic and health misrepresentation in the context of assisted reproductive technology but does not directly involve artificial intelligence or machine learning.",
        "In the case of Austin D. Martin v. State of Hawai\u2018i, the United States District Court denied Martin's motion for reconsideration of a prior order that remanded his state court criminal prosecution for driving without insurance back to state court due to an untimely notice of removal and lack of jurisdiction. Martin, proceeding pro se, failed to demonstrate sufficient grounds for reconsideration under the applicable legal standards and did not satisfy the requirements for removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1). The court also noted concerns regarding the accuracy of case citations and quotations in Martin's submissions, suggesting potential reliance on artificial intelligence for their generation.",
        "In the case of Ogletree v. Cleveland State University, the court ruled that requiring students to perform remote room scans before online tests violated the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. Plaintiff Aaron Ogletree, a student, challenged the practice after being asked to scan his bedroom, claiming it intruded on his privacy rights. The court concluded that the privacy interest in one's home outweighed the university's interest in maintaining test integrity, noting that the use of AI in the proctoring tools, such as Honorlock, was part of the broader context but did not mitigate the unreasonableness of conducting room scans.",
        "In the case SEC v. Clayton et al., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleges John Clayton and others, including defendant Donald Perry, participated in a securities fraud scheme involving the illegal sale of stock from small, publicly traded companies. Clayton is accused of manipulating stock ownership through nominee entities he controlled and inflating stock prices, while Perry, as Clayton's bookkeeper, facilitated these fraudulent transactions by providing misleading information to brokerage firms and assisting in document forgery. The court denied Perry's motion to dismiss the SEC's claims, finding that the allegations of his involvement meet the required legal standards, including sufficient particularity and an inference of recklessness.",
        "In the case of Klein et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc., the plaintiffs, comprising individuals and entities that purchased advertising on Facebook, alleged that Meta's monopolization of the social advertising market resulted in artificially inflated ad prices. They claimed violations of Section 2 and Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The court denied Meta's motion to dismiss the amended complaint, finding that the plaintiffs had plausibly alleged predatory conduct that harmed competition in the advertising market. The complaint noted that Facebook's integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning was part of its anticompetitive strategies, suggesting that these technologies were employed to maintain and strengthen its market dominance.",
        "In the case of Jones v. Armbrister, Joseph Lee Jones filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging his recent sentencing for forgery and identity theft. Jones claims his rights were violated based on various constitutional grounds, including due process, First Amendment rights, access to the courts, and Eighth Amendment protections, while asserting that he is an 'Artificial intelligence researcher.'

        "In the case of Trio v. Turing Video, Inc., the plaintiff Sandra Trio alleged that Turing violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by collecting, storing, and disseminating her biometric data without informed consent. Turing manufactured the Turing Shield, a kiosk that uses artificial intelligence to screen for COVID-19 by scanning users' facial geometry, measuring temperature, and checking for mask compliance. The court denied Turing's motion to dismiss the case, determining that it had personal jurisdiction due to sufficient contacts with Illinois and that the allegations adequately stated a claim under BIPA.",
        "In the case Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society v. HonorSociety.org, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit overturned a preliminary injunction that prohibited HonorSociety from engaging in various forms of online speech and required it to include a disclaimer regarding ongoing litigation. The court found the injunction to be overbroad, as it restricted both commercial and non-commercial speech without adequately demonstrating potential harm, and it found the compelled disclaimer violated the First Amendment. The dispute involved allegations by PTK against HonorSociety for misleading information, including the use of generative AI to create deceptive content about PTK.",
        "In the case of Abbasi v. Bhalodwala, the plaintiff, Mohammad Umer Khan Abbasi, accused defendants Jipal P. Bhalodwala and RealTime Networking, Inc. of copyright infringement and unfair competition regarding his software, the Lottery Tracking System (LTS). Abbasi alleged that the defendants created a competing product that was substantially identical to LTS, using images and functionalities from his copyrighted material. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, affirming that the claims, including copyright infringement, unfair competition under the Lanham Act, and violations of state law, were sufficiently supported by the allegations that involved direct access to Abbasi's software and potential consumer confusion.",
        "In the case of Hall v. UiPath, Derek Hall appealed a summary judgment granted to UiPath, alleging retaliation under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) after his termination following an internal complaint of age discrimination. The Fifth Circuit upheld the district court's ruling, stating that Hall failed to demonstrate a causal link between his protected activity and his termination, and he did not adequately challenge UiPath's non-discriminatory rationale\u2014that he was terminated due to poor performance and not fitting well with the company's sales team. The case does not directly involve artificial intelligence or automated systems but examines employment practices at a software company known for its automation solutions.",
        "In the case of Clayton Silva v. U.S. Army et al., Silva, a pro se litigant, filed a convoluted complaint against various federal agencies and pharmaceutical companies, alleging conspiracy and torture involving fake prescription drugs and advanced technologies such as wireless manipulation and mind control. The defendants, including the U.S. Army, CIA, NSA, and pharmaceutical companies, filed motions to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The court ultimately granted the motions to dismiss, concluding that Silva's allegations were vague, unsupported, and did not meet the legal standards required for federal jurisdiction or for stating a plausible claim.",
        "In the case of Mantha v. QuoteWizard.com, LLC, plaintiff Joseph Mantha alleges violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) based on two unsolicited text messages received from QuoteWizard in August 2019, claiming he did not consent to receive them. The court had previously dismissed a part of the complaint regarding automated calls but allowed the plaintiff to amend his complaint to include new facts suggesting that the text messages were sent using an automated telephone dialing system (ATDS) through Drips LLC, a third party utilizing artificial intelligence and bots to mimic human interactions. The court also addressed various discovery disputes and expanded the scope of discovery phase to include individual claims related to consent and the nature of the text messages.",
        "In the case of Bobby M. Kemp v. Ahmad Beirami, the plaintiff, a Florida prisoner, filed a civil rights action alleging that Beirami, while employed by Meta Platforms, Inc., helped design an AI machine that intercepted Kemp's electronic communications and facial recognition profile, violating federal law. The court denied Kemp's motion to proceed in forma pauperis due to his failure to submit the necessary trust fund account statement and dismissed the case without prejudice, noting that the Southern District of California may not be the appropriate venue for the action.",
        "In the case of Joseph Lee Jones v. Douglas County Jail, a pro se petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 while being a pretrial detainee awaiting a competency evaluation on drug-related charges. The court found that Jones failed to exhaust his state court remedies and that his allegations of constitutional violations were primarily based on state law, which are not grounds for federal habeas relief. The court also ruled that his claims related to his right to a speedy trial were not sufficiently substantiated, and thus his petition was denied. Furthermore, numerous motions filed by Jones, including those related to grievances about jail conditions and legal representation, were also denied.",
        "In the case of SharifyMoghaddam et al. v. Blinken et al., plaintiffs Sayeh SharifyMoghaddam and Seyyed Mahmood Jafari Sadeghi, dual Iranian and Canadian nationals, sued U.S. officials to compel a decision on their immigrant visa applications, alleging unreasonable delay. The court ultimately dismissed the case, asserting that the delays, which had extended to fifteen months since their visa interview, were not deemed unreasonable under the established TRAC factors, particularly given the absence of a statutory timeline for visa adjudication. The plaintiffs, both researchers in artificial intelligence, argued that the delay was harming their careers and mentorship opportunities, yet the court concluded that the agency's timeline was reasonable compared to precedents in similar cases.",
        "In the case of Puerto Rico Soccer League NFP, Corp. et al. v. Federaci\u00f3n Puertorrique\u00f1a de F\u00fatbol et al., the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico addressed multiple citation inaccuracies in the plaintiffs' motions, leading the court to conclude that the plaintiffs failed to meet their professional obligations. The court found that the citations contained significant errors, including references to non-existent cases and misattributed quotes, indicating a lack of thoroughness and preparation from the plaintiffs' counsel. Consequently, the court decided to impose sanctions on the plaintiffs' attorneys, ordering them to pay the defendants' legal fees incurred due to the filing of these flawed motions.",
        "In the case of **Kemp v. Kuttler**, the plaintiff, Bobby M. Kemp, a Florida prisoner, filed a civil rights lawsuit alleging that Heinrich Kuttler, employed by Meta Platforms, Inc., participated in designing an AI machine that unlawfully intercepted Kemp's electronic communications and facial recognition data.

FAST Enterprises LLC and CSG Government Solutions, the plaintiffs, victims of a flawed automated fraud detection system implemented by the Michigan Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA), allege that they were erroneously labeled as fraudsters due to an automated process lacking adequate human oversight. The plaintiffs challenged the system's procedures, claiming violations of their procedural due process rights due to insufficient notice and the inability to appeal determinations of fraud. The court found that the plaintiffs had sufficiently demonstrated standing, with their injuries being fairly traceable to the actions of the defendants, who were involved in developing and managing the automated system that led to the flawed fraud determinations.",
        "John Doe successfully moved to quash subpoenas issued by Spider Labs to Google and LinkedIn, which sought his identifying information after Spider Labs accused him of defamation related to its anti-Ad Fraud product, SpiderAF. Doe had posed questions about the legitimacy of Spider Labs' claims regarding its use of AI in fraud detection through emails to the company's clients, prompting Spider Labs to pursue legal action. The court ruled in favor of Doe, establishing that Spider Labs did not meet the prima facie standard for defamation claims, and found Doe's right to anonymous speech under the First Amendment applied in this case.",
        "In Whaley v. Equifax Information Services, the court conditionally granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint for violating Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) due to its verbosity and lack of clarity regarding alleged violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

        "Cody Clark filed a putative class action against Microsoft Corporation, alleging violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) in relation to the collection and use of biometric data obtained through video-based coaching software provided by Brainshark, which utilizes Microsoft's Azure services. The court granted Microsoft's motion to dismiss Clark's claims under sections 15(b) and 15(d) for failing to allege that Microsoft actively obtained the biometric data or disclosed it, while allowing the claim under section 15(a) to proceed. Clark's claim under section 15(c) was dismissed due to lack of standing, as he did not demonstrate how he was harmed by Microsoft profiting from the use of his biometric data.",
        "In the case Gonzalez v. Texas Taxpayers and Research Association (TTRA), the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas granted TTRA's motion to dismiss Rikkie Gonzalez's claims of employment discrimination, retaliation, and a hostile work environment under Title VII and the Texas Labor Code due to her failure to adequately plead that TTRA met the employee threshold required under these statutes. The court also dismissed her state law claims for emotional distress and defamation without prejudice, as it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction after dismissing the federal claims. Notably, the court struck Gonzalez's responsive briefing because her counsel used artificial intelligence to draft it, leading to the submission of misleading cases and errors.",
        "In the case of Michael Anthony Allen v. Facebook et al., the plaintiff, incarcerated in Kansas, filed a pro se civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, claiming that social media companies exposed him to harmful 'illegal A.I.' emissions that caused psychological distress and suicidal thoughts. The court found the complaint to be largely incomprehensible and lacking a plausible claim that any of the defendants were state actors, which is a requirement for \u00a7 1983 claims. The court dismissed the complaint as frivolous, stating that the allegations did not establish any actionable basis against private companies like Facebook.",
        "Wired Informatics, LLC filed a lawsuit against OmniMD Inc. for breach of contract and other claims related to a software license agreement concerning a product called Invenio, which was represented to be an artificial intelligence engine for processing medical transcripts.

        "In the case of Frederick v. And Company, the plaintiff, Darion Dion Frederick, filed a complaint without a clear legal basis, seeking a vast sum in damages and making claims that lacked intelligibility and substance. The court found that his allegations failed to establish any plausible federal jurisdiction or valid legal claims, leading to a recommendation for dismissal of the case as frivolous under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). The case does not appear to involve artificial intelligence or machine learning elements.",

However, upon review, the Magistrate Judge recommended the dismissal of Fluckers's claims, stating that he failed to allege any specific actions taken by the defendants against him or to identify any wrongdoing. Fluckers's claims involved references to 'AI' and actions purportedly taken by people locally, including collection of personal information related to his anatomy, but he did not substantiate these allegations with concrete details or evidence against the defendants.",
        "Derek Mobley filed a lawsuit against Workday, Inc., claiming that its AI-based applicant recommendation system discriminated against job applicants based on age, race, and disability, particularly impacting individuals over forty years old. Mobley seeks preliminary certification of a collective action for his Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) claim, which would allow similarly situated applicants to join him. The court granted the preliminary certification, finding that Mobley sufficiently alleged a unified policy where Workday's AI system scores, sorts, or ranks applicants, potentially leading to a disparate impact on older applicants.",
        "The case involves a motion for centralization of multiple individual personal injury actions against video game developers and technology companies, alleging that their products have psychologically addictive features designed to attract young players. The United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation denied the motion for centralization, citing substantial differences among the cases, including the variety of video games and defendants involved. Although plaintiffs claimed a common conspiracy among manufacturers to create addiction, the panel found that the differences outweighed the similarities. The decision emphasized that informal coordination among the cases was a viable alternative to formal centralization.",
        "In the case Gonzalez v. Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, the court imposed sanctions on Plaintiff\u2019s counsel, John L. Pittman, for submitting a brief with numerous errors, including misrepresented or non-existent case citations.

Morissette, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan denied Plaintiff Joseph Michael Hunt's motion for reconsideration regarding an earlier order that required him to pay Defendants Alanis Morissette and Epiphany Productions Inc. $3,284.61 in attorneys' fees. Hunt argued that the Defendants' attorneys had committed 'Fraud Upon The Court' by using out-of-state counsel and based part of his argument on answers provided by an artificial intelligence program. The court ruled that the attorneys' practices did not constitute unauthorized practice of law as they complied with local and professional conduct rules, and it clarified that AI-generated material was not a valid basis for legal arguments.",
        "The Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court's summary judgment in favor of Bank of America in a trademark infringement case brought by Erik Underwood and My24HourNews.com, Inc. The plaintiffs claimed the use of the service mark \"E.R.I.C.A.\" was being infringed upon by BofA's similar mark for its virtual financial assistant. The court found that plaintiffs failed to prove their mark clearly identified and distinguished their services, which were tied to a website for searching movie-related information, and thus they could not establish a protectable interest in the mark.",
        "In the case of Asia Johnson v. Young Money, the plaintiff, representing herself, filed a complaint against the music label Young Money alleging assault, libel, slander, and copyright infringement related to her claims that her work was being used without permission.

        "In the case of Gjovik v. Apple Inc., the court addressed two motions filed by Ashley M. Gjovik: one to strike certain affirmative defenses asserted by Apple and another for a more definite statement regarding Apple's answer to her complaint. The court granted in part and denied in part the motion to strike, allowing Apple to amend its defenses for those that lacked specificity while rejecting others that were legally or factually untenable. The motion for a more definite statement was denied, as the applicable rule required a responsive pleading which was not present in this case. Additionally, the court highlighted concerns about Ms. Gjovik's use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate legal documents, stressing her responsibility to verify the accuracy of AI-generated information.",
        "In the case of Stein v. Clarifai, Inc., Plaintiff Jordan Stein alleged that Clarifai, a New York-based AI technology company, unlawfully collected and profited from her OKCupid profile photographs without consent, thereby violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).

Clearview AI, Inc., plaintiffs filed a putative class action lawsuit under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA), alleging that Clearview AI unlawfully created and profited from a database of over three billion facial scans obtained by scraping images from social media. The court addressed Clearview's removal of the case to federal court and the plaintiffs' motion to remand it back to state court, ultimately concluding that Clearview failed to establish Article III standing as the plaintiffs did not allege a concrete injury beyond statutory aggrievement. The case highlights the implications of AI technologies in privacy rights, particularly concerning facial recognition and the unauthorized sale of biometric data.",
        "In the case of Whale Capital, L.P. v. Ridgeway et al., the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana addressed a Motion for Reconsideration filed by the Defendants, Christopher M. Ridgeway and FS Properties of Florida, LLC, regarding the Court's previous order on document production. The Court denied the motion, stating that the Defendants merely repeated previously rejected arguments and raised a new Rule 9(b) argument improperly for the first time in the reconsideration motion. This decision illustrates the importance of timely presenting all arguments in legal proceedings, without reliance on reconsideration as a means to introduce new claims or rehash old ones.",
        "In the case of Hodge v. United States, Chuck Allen Hodge, a state pretrial detainee, appealed the dismissal of his complaint against the United States, which was deemed to lack jurisdiction and fail to state a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).

The Tenth Circuit dismissed Hodge's appeal as frivolous, denying his motion to proceed in forma pauperis.",
        "The case Dopp v. Wray et al. involves plaintiff Sidney David Dopp, who filed a pro se complaint alleging harm from an implanted chip that purportedly caused him psychological and physical issues, including mind control and auditory hallucinations.

        "In the case of Sherry Ann McGann v. Jeanne Y. Jagow, the Tenth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel dismissed McGann's appeal for lack of standing. The appeal stemmed from a bankruptcy court's order requiring McGann to turn over property and awarding attorney's fees to the Chapter 7 Trustee due to McGann's civil contempt. The Panel determined that McGann was not a 'person aggrieved' as she failed to object to the Fee Motion or attend the relevant hearings, thus not meeting the Tenth Circuit's prerequisites for standing. The dismissal underscores the importance of procedural compliance in bankruptcy appeals.",

Washington et al, the Trustee Brian Ryniker, representing Augustus Intelligence Inc. and certain investors, brought several claims against Kevin Washington and others, primarily revolving around a failed investment agreement intended to leverage Washington's status as a lead investor to attract additional capital for the company's artificial intelligence-driven cryptocurrency mining operations. The court dismissed the claims against Washington, finding a lack of subject matter jurisdiction for the investors' claims, as they involved disputes between non-debtors, and ruled that the breach of contract claim was unenforceable due to its fraudulent context. The case highlights how AI was central to Augustus's business strategy, which involved using AI capabilities in cryptocurrency mining.",
        "In the case of Goins v. Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, the pro se plaintiff, Terry Terell Goins, alleged employment discrimination and retaliation based on sex after being terminated from his position as a Family Teacher.

        "In the case of Estate of Gene B. Lokken et al. v. UnitedHealth Group Inc. et al., Plaintiffs, who are Medicare Advantage customers, sued UHC for the denial of post-acute care coverage using an artificial intelligence program, nH Predict, which they alleged led to unreasonable coverage decisions. The court held that while the plaintiffs must exhaust administrative remedies, this was waived on futility grounds due to alleged irreparable harm from UHC's processes. Ultimately, most claims were preempted by the Medicare Act, allowing only the breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claims to proceed, as these did not directly challenge the Medicare standards.",
        "In the case Mid Central Operating Engineers Health and Welfare Fund v. Hoosiervac LLC, Defendant's counsel, Rafael Ramirez, was recommended for personal sanctions due to submitting briefs that cited non-existent cases, which he admitted were generated using artificial intelligence tools without verification.

Teledrip LLC et al., Drips filed a motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint against Teledrip, its CEO, and two additional defendants, alleging various claims including unfair competition and misappropriation of trade secrets. The court recommended denying the motion, citing undue delay, lack of good cause for the late amendment, and potential prejudice to the defendants, as the factual basis for the claims existed long before the proposed amendments. Additionally, the case touches on AI in the context of accusations against Teledrip that its sales agents made false statements about Drips\u2019 use of AI, which were integral to the allegations of business disparagement and unfair competition.",
        "In the case of Abdul Nevarez v. Forty Niners Football Company, LLC, the court addressed a dispute over the production of electronically stored information (ESI) during the discovery phase. The defendants, having identified around 297,000 documents through search terms, expressed concern about potentially non-responsive documents that could include privileged information.

        "In the case of National Security Counselors v. CIA, the National Security Counselors (NSC) appealed a series of district court rulings related to their Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. The court upheld the CIA's decisions to deny two specific FOIA requests: one for a list of FOIA requesters categorized by fee types, which required record creation, and another for all records concerning the IBM supercomputer 'Watson,' which was deemed overly broad and burdensome. Additionally, the court addressed NSC's challenge regarding the withholding of certain Department of Justice opinions under attorney-client privilege, ultimately rejecting NSC's claim that the privilege had been waived. The case highlights the complexities surrounding FOIA requests related to records about AI technologies.",
        "In the case Deyerler v. HireVue Inc., six Illinois residents filed a class action lawsuit against HireVue, a software vendor known for using AI in virtual job interviews, claiming violations of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The plaintiffs alleged that HireVue's software captured and collected their biometric information without proper consent during these interviews. The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled that it had specific personal jurisdiction over HireVue due to its intentional actions of marketing software that recorded biometric data in Illinois. The court partially granted HireVue's motion to dismiss, allowing claims under several sections of BIPA related to retention policies and unauthorized biometric data capture to proceed, while dismissing claims regarding profit from biometric data due to insufficient allegations.",
        "In the case 'In Re: OpenAI, Inc., Copyright Infringement Litigation,' the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation has ordered the centralization of multiple lawsuits involving OpenAI, asserting that it is necessary for efficient litigation.

The court denied the motion to compel arbitration, determining that no valid agreement existed between CCC and Tractable due to Tractable's deceptive actions, and emphasized that enforcing arbitration would reward Tractable's fraudulent conduct.",
        "Aidong Chen appealed the dismissal of his lawsuit against KPMG and several individuals, claiming misappropriation of intellectual property related to a GPU project he developed while employed there. The court affirmed the dismissal, finding that Chen failed to demonstrate the novelty of his idea, which was already public knowledge, and he did not adequately allege claims of racial or national origin discrimination under Title VII. The case involved Chen's work on artificial intelligence initiatives utilizing GPUs, but the court concluded that his allegations did not meet the legal standards for intellectual property claims.",

Middlebrooks, filed a pro se complaint alleging that her property was transferred without due process through a questionable quitclaim deed. The court expressed concerns that her filings appeared to be too professionally prepared for a pro se litigant, prompting a Show Cause Order to clarify whether she received assistance from an attorney or used AI tools like ChatGPT. After Middlebrooks accused the court of racism for issuing the order and failed to respond by the deadline, the court extended her time to clarify the drafting of her pleadings, emphasizing the potential ethical violations by any aiding attorney rather than questioning her abilities.",

        "In the case of Kemp v. Meta Platforms Inc., the plaintiff, a federal prisoner, filed a pro se civil complaint alleging that Meta unlawfully accessed and used his private electronic communications through its platforms (Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram) using artificial intelligence (AI). He claimed that Meta's AI, developed in 2017 and integrated further in 2018, monitored and intercepted his communications in violation of the Stored Communications Act and the Wiretap Act. The court granted Meta's motion to dismiss based on res judicata, as the plaintiff previously made similar claims in another lawsuit, which had been dismissed for failure to state a claim, and thus barred the current action without leave to amend.",
        "In the case of Carter et al. v. UZGlobal LLC et al., a significant issue arose regarding the use of artificial intelligence in preparing legal filings. It was discovered that an associate attorney, now terminated, utilized AI to generate text in the plaintiffs' response, leading to citations of non-existent cases in their briefs.

        "In the case of Ryan v. X Corp., the court granted X Corp.'s motion to dismiss Jeremy Ryan's claims, including promissory fraud, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and unfair business practices, determining they were barred by X's Terms of Service. The court ruled that all claims arose from Ryan's inability to access his accounts after they were suspended, a right retained by X under its service terms, which limit liability for such actions. Notably, Ryan alleged that X utilized an artificial intelligence system to identify and suspend accounts without adequate disclosure, but the court concluded that his claims, including his unjust enrichment claim\u2014based on revenue generated from advertisements related to his suspended content\u2014were connected to X's functions as a publisher, thus protected under the Communications Decency Act. The court allowed Ryan a final opportunity to amend his complaint.",
