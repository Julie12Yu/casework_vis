all prompts used in the process of getting contribution 1

1_prep_cases.py

- this step went through and got all the cases found on govinfo in november
- and then, we generated summaries for each case that would include all fht the legal text
- this was the prompt used to summarize:

```
You are a legal expert. Analyze this court case opinion and provide:
1. Summary (2–3 sentences). If the case involves artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), or automated systems, explicitly highlight how the AI/automation is involved in the facts, claims, or holding.
2. Key Legal Issue
3. Court's Holding
4. ELI5 explanation

Opinion text:
{text}
```

- this went through each case and started creating the 2 level clusters
- the following text is the "legal_categories"

```
1. Antitrust: market competition, monopolization, market power, anti-competitive practices, market dominance, price-fixing, exclusive dealing, or restraint of trade involving ANY tech companies, or anti-competitive practices by major platforms or AI companies.
2. IP Law: patents, copyrights, trademarks for AI models or tech, or training data disputes, AI-generated content ownership.
3. Privacy and Data Protection: data breaches, unauthorized data collection by automated systems, or privacy violations involving algorithms or data processing.
4. Tort: physical harm, emotional distress, negligence, defamation, or personal injury involving ANY automated systems, tech systems, major tech corporations using AI, or algorithms.
5. Justice and Equity: discrimination, bias, civil rights violations, equal protection issues, equity issues, fairness concerns, or systemic bias, alleged or substantiated discrimination or bias caused by AI, automated systems, or algorithms, or related to AI, automated systems, or algorithims. (e.g., hiring, lending, search).
6. Consumer Protection: deceptive practices, unfair business practices with tech/automated systems, or misleading marketing of tech products or AI capabilities.
7. AI in Legal Proceedings: AI systems are merely used in the court processes, legal case management, or litigation tools. The core contention is not about AI, but AI tools have been used in the litigation process.
8. Unrelated: cases that have no meaningful connection to AI, ML, or automated systems. If the case involves discrimination, privacy, or other issues **without automation/AI/algorithmic involvement**, classify as Unrelated.
```

- at the highest level, we are classifying clusters into one of our 8 categories
- the following text was used to do so:

```
You are a legal expert classifying a cluster of court cases into ONE legal category.

Think about how AI, ML, automated systems, or algorithims may have impacted the case.
Use these definitions carefully and be conservative about assigning AI-related labels.
If it is not clear that AI, ML, or automated systems are central to the dispute, choose 8 (Unrelated).
Only choose Unrelated (8) if the case doesn't fit categories 1-7.

{LEGAL_CATEGORIES}

Cases in this cluster:
{sample}

Respond with EXACTLY one digit from 1 to 8 and nothing else.
Category number (1–8):
```

- these greater clusters has a further name, generated by:

```
You are a legal expert naming a high-level topic cluster of court cases.

This cluster has been classified as: {category_name}
{subcluster_context}

Task:
- Provide ONE concise name (3-7 words) that captures the overarching theme within this category.
- Format: "Specific Topic: {category_name}"
- Example: "Facial Recognition Biometric Claims: Privacy and Data Protection"
- The first part should be broad enough to encompass the subclusters, the category name stays as-is after the colon.

Court case summaries from this topic:
{sample_docs}

Respond with ONLY the cluster name in the format "Topic: Category". No explanations.

Cluster name:
```

- and finally, we have the lowest category, which is the smaller cluster names, generated by:

```
You are a legal expert naming a tight, coherent subcluster of court cases.

This is a cluster of similar court cases.

Task:
- Provide ONE concise name (3-7 words) that captures the specific shared theme.
- Be SPECIFIC - this is a tight cluster, not a broad category.
- Focus on the commonality these cases share.

Court case summaries from this cluster:

Respond with ONLY the subcluster name. No explanations, quotes, or extra text.
